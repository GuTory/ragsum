  "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out what the capital of France is. Hmm, let me think about this. I know that France is a country in Europe, and I've heard people refer to Paris as its capital before. But wait, I'm not entirely sure if that's correct or if there's another city that takes that title.\n\nI remember learning in school that Paris is the main city in France, but maybe it's also known for other reasons. Like, it has landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre Museum. Those are pretty famous attractions, so that must mean Paris is a significant place. Also, I think governments or political centers are often in capital cities, so if someone refers to the President of France, they're probably talking about someone from Paris.\n\nBut just to be safe, maybe I should consider other possibilities. Sometimes countries have multiple capitals for various reasons, like administrative or cultural. For example, London is both a city and a capital, but that's in the UK. In some places, the capital might not be the largest city, but in France, I believe Paris is both the largest and the capital.\n\nWait, could there be another city that shares the title? I don't recall any other major cities in France like Marseille or Lyon being referred to as capitals. They are important cities, especially Marseille for its history and culture, but they aren't considered capitals. So it must be Paris.\n\nI think I've heard this before in history classes and maybe in news reports when events happened in France. If something significant happens, it's usually reported from Paris because that's where the government is. So yes, Paris sounds right.\n\nTo sum up, based on what I know about France's geography, landmarks, and political structure, Paris must be the capital.\n</think>\n\nThe capital of France is Paris.",
