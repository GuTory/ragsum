         "Thank you, Peter, and welcome, everyone. I will first highlight some of the fourth quarter and full year financial accomplishments and then provide our guidance for the first quarter of 2018. Q4 net sales came in at EUR 2.56 billion, exceeding our guidance by over EUR 400 million. Due to demand strength, some customers requested earlier shipments of lithography systems, which we were able to accommodate late in the quarter. This accounted for almost half of the EUR 400 million and the other half came from earlier-than-expected acceptance of the performance of 2 previously shipped EUV systems by a customer, which led to recognition of deferred revenue in Q4   \nNet system sales of EUR 1.95 billion was threatened by memory contributed 53% of sales; foundry accounted for 29%; and IDM was 18% of system sales.\nInstalled Base Management sales for the quarter came in at EUR 606 million, which was in line with our guidance. Gross margin for the quarter came in at 45.2%, which was 120 basis points higher than our guidance. This was the result of much stronger-than-expected DUV sales, more than offsetting the dilutive effect from incremental EUV revenue that was recognized during the quarter.\nOverall OpEx came in slightly above guidance with R&D expenses at [ EUR 317 million ] and SG&A expenses at EUR 113 million. \nTurning to the balance sheet. Quarter-over-quarter cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments came in at EUR 3.29 billion.\nDuring the quarter, we purchased approximately EUR 331 million worth of shares. Since January 2016, we have purchased a total of approximately 8.2 million shares with the value of EUR 900 million against our 2016/'17 authorization of EUR 1.5 billion.\nMoving on to the order book. Before systems bookings came in at a strong EUR 2.93 billion. This is almost an EUR 800 million increase compared to Q3 bookings. The order intake was driven by the memory sector, representing 55% of orders compared to a 30% for foundry and 15% for IDM.\nThe 10 new orders for EUV systems and our EUV backlog now reflects 28 systems valued at EUR 3.1 billion. Our overall system backlog now totals a record [ EUR 6.68 billion ] and is balanced nicely between memory, foundry and IDM.\nOur strong Q4 results marked the closure of an exceptionally year for the industry and ASML. For the full year, our net sales grew 33% to a record of EUR 9.05 billion. Net Installed Base Management sales grew more than 25% to a record of EUR 2.68 billion.  These total EUV sales almost at EUR 1.2 billion -- 2017 was the year was preparations for inserting EUV into high-volume chip manufacturing shifted into a higher gear. Of the 12 EUV shipments planned for 2017, we shipped 10 during the year; 1 shipment is in progress and 1 shipment is planned this month. This means that our 2018 shipment plan will increase by 2 to a total of 22 systems.\nWe made considerable improvements in our EUV gross margin in 2017, achieving 0% in the fourth quarter. Due to accelerated investments in EUV service infrastructure, we had not achieved 0% for the full year. Nevertheless, even with a more than 3x increase in EUV revenue from 2016 to 2017, we were able to improve our corporate gross margin to 45%. We are on track to achieving overall gross margin exceeding 50% in 2020.\nWe continue to invest in the long-term future of ASML and increase R&D from EUR 1.1 billion in 2016 to EUR 1.26 billion in 2017. This increase was driven by accounting for a full year of HMI, our contributions to sized SMTs, and our own investments in high NA. Overall R&D investments as a percentage of revenue decreased from about 16% in 2016 to about 14% in 2017. \nSG&A as a percentage of revenue were used by almost 1 percentage-point to about 4.6% of revenue.\nOur net income for the full year grew 44% to a record of EUR 2.12 billion, resulting in a net margin of 23.4% and an EPS of EUR 4.93.\nI would like to turn to our expectations and guidance for the first quarter of 2018. We expect Q1 total net sales of around EUR 2.2 billion. As a reminder, we pulled approximately EUR 400 million from this quarter into Q4 2017.\nWhile we target to ship 4 EUV systems in the March quarter, we expect revenue recognition of about EUR 150 million for our EUV business. Overall, we do expect quarter-over-quarter revenue growth throughout 2018.\nWe expect our Q1 Installed Base Management revenue to come in around EUR 600 million. \nGross margin for Q1 is expected to be between 47% and 48%. R&D expenses for Q1 will reflect continued accelerated investment in our portfolio and will come in at around EUR 350 million. And SG&A is expected to come in at about EUR 115 million.\nWe are excited about 2018, which will be a year of continue to strong growth in revenue and profitability."

In 2018, Chipotle will celebrate its 25th anniversary. This is an ideal time to reflect on the things that have contributed to our success over the past 25 years while at the same time provide an update on the fundamental changes we are making across the business to enable us to get back on a strong growth trajectory and realize our vast potential. As I think back on the past 25 years, I'm proud of the unique company we've created. Our success is based on our passion for serving great-tasting, wholesome food that's served in an interactive environment. It has been our vision and the commitment of doing what is right for our guests, employees, suppliers and farmers, the environment and animals well before these things were common in the world of fast food, all while delivering a superior economic model that has led to our success. When I started Chipotle, I wanted to show that just because food is served fast doesn't mean it has to be a typical fast food experience. It wasn't a commonly held view at the time, but it certainly has paid off. I continue to believe that this approach to serving nutritious wholesome and delicious food remains highly valued by our guests and can deliver strong returns to our shareholders.\nNow after 25 years, we must navigate new challenges by continuing to evolve how we approach the business. Our results for the quarter clearly show that there's still work to be done to restore strong growth and customer trust. And today, I want to discuss the progress remaking on a number of initiatives that will transform how we manage the company and that will provide a solid foundation for how we build the business going forward. \nToday, I want to talk about 3 key areas of focus: first, our operational changes in efforts to perfect the guest experience; second, enhancing the guest experience through innovations in digital and catering; and third, reinvesting in our existing restaurants to enhance guest convenience and improve the appearance and function of our restaurants. In addition, I'll provide an update in our CEO search. First, let me discuss the operational changes in efforts to perfect the dining experience. After spending time in our restaurants over the past few months, I've seen firsthand the impact Scott Boatwright and his team are having in our operations. Shifting our operational culture requires leadership, determination and time to retrain and build new habits. Our field leaders are spending time with managers to focus on what it takes to effectively train our teams to deliver an excellent guest experience. Scott and his team have formalized the role of the manager and the role of the field leader to ensure all their efforts are focused on the guest experience, and our support teams are building extensive detailed trading programs to provide the necessary tools for this type of change. We're also launching a dedicated centralized training program based in Denver. This program combines classroom teaching, which is new to Chipotle, with live in-store training in a certified Chipotle restaurant. The curriculum has been tailored to our field leaders to ensure we are effectively addressing the most important elements of delivering a great guest experience. That effort is beginning to pay off as we developed consistency around the speed of service and improving hospitality from every crew member. We're revisiting the concept of throughput, which has historically been an incredible strength of our business. As our training program continues to take hold, our teams will be primed to refocus on delivering excellent throughput in the restaurant again and will be looking at various ways to incentivize terrific throughput. When executed correctly with well-trained crew, throughput is one of the best tools we've had to build sales and to build our brand. \nWe also completed the restructuring of our field leadership, reducing the number of regions and eliminating unnecessary layers about the restaurant. Our field leader ratios have been reduced, enabling our strong field leaders to spend more time in each restaurant. This has had a direct and lasting impact on the restaurant teams. \nAnd over the past 6 months, we've implemented a new guest satisfaction system in our restaurants, and we are encouraged by improvements we've seen across all measures, including key areas of friendliness and ease of ordering. These renewed efforts come in addition to the incentive program changes we instituted at the restaurant level 1 year ago, which makes the guest experience a key component of incentive compensation for our restaurant and field teams. With early signs of an improved guest experience, we are excited to celebrate our 25th anniversary with all of our guests, employees and partners. We will incorporate the 25th anniversary celebration into many of our marketing and promotional campaigns this year, and it will be a rallying point for our brand. We have passionate and loyal fans that love Chipotle, and it's a great opportunity to share their stories along with reminding our guests of all the things that make us unique and special. We'll share more of this campaign with you on our first quarter call.\nNow let me turn to how we are enhancing our guest experience to build sales through innovations in digital and catering. It's clear we must also ensure that we are offering new and convenient ways for our guests to interact with Chipotle. For much of our 25-year history, innovation at Chipotle rightfully focused on sourcing better ingredients, improving our cooking techniques and making our kitchens and equipment more efficient. But over the last year, we've been building new competencies around improving the guest experience through technology and testing new or enhanced offerings. Each of these is designed to improve convenience, add interest to our menu and deliver a better overall experience for our guests. Our digital sales continue to be the fastest-growing part of our business. We had new records in the fourth quarter as our second make line sales were up 33% over the prior year. Our digital sales mix was 8.6% of sales while 2 of our regions have digital sales of more than 10% of their overall mix. We continue to be optimistic as we further market this capability and as guests increasingly order Chipotle through digital platforms. \nThis digital sales growth has been led by mobile ordering, which is up 50% over last year, and the increase has been driven by the new version of our mobile app for Apple and Android. The app's new features include quick reorder of favorite and recent orders and the ability to receive, store and redeem offers. We have also introduced new mobile pay options, a more user-friendly store locator and a streamlined user experience with enhanced design, and guest response has been consistently positive since the launch. For instance, average monthly users on mobile have more than doubled since the release of the app. We're also seeing higher guest satisfaction in the restaurants that have the new second make line, and we've seen further reduction in guest wait times to under 15 minutes as we continue to optimize our Smarter Pickup Times. In 2018, we will accelerate the rollout of our digitally enabled second make lines. These new lines enable a faster more accurate experience for digital customers and allow our crews to more easily support the higher sales volumes. Cumulatively including new restaurants, we expect to have at least 30% of a restaurants outdated with this new second make lines by the end of 2018. We're prioritizing our markets and targeting locations that currently have the highest digital sales volumes to install these new make lines. We're also testing new catering offerings, which include options for smaller groups, more convenient packaging and new lower-priced options, all of which should help accelerate growth. The test includes catering options for as low as $9 per person and for groups as small as 10 people compared to our current catering, which requires a minimum of 20 people starting at prices of $12 a person. \nWe offer delivery support for catering in about 40% of a restaurants now, and we look forward to expanding this ahead of our peak graduation season. \nWith these initiatives taking hold, our catering sales have grown 20% over the last year. Catering is only a little more than 1% of our sales today with tremendous opportunity for growth in the future. We're also creating new restaurant designs, which are optimized for mobile ordering, more ordering options, better beverage presentation and more comfortable dining areas. These new designs have the ability to be applied to our existing restaurants and to any restaurants that we build. Additionally, we'll reinvest in our existing restaurant base as we launch a significant refresh and maintenance effort to improve the experience. We are replacing dim lighting, upgrading equipment in our service lines and addressing all areas where restaurants have become warm both inside and outside. We'll continue to expand our digital infrastructure at a restaurants, and we'll also replace aging equipment. Some of these projects are relatively small in scope but with the potential to deliver a significant impact. Jack is going to talk in more detail on the financial impacts of these initiatives.\nChipotle has always been a purpose-driven company. We've had a relentless commitment to doing what's right for our guests and our employees. This year, we will invest more than 1/3 of our anticipated tax savings in our restaurant and support teams through a special bonus and expanded benefits. We will first invest more toward training programs for employees, including the formalized classroom program that we are establishing in Denver. We're also announcing a special bonus program for all employees this year from hourly crew who will be eligible to earn $250 special bonus to a restaurant general managers who will be eligible to earn $1,000 special bonus. And we are expanding our competitive benefits program with paid maternity and paternity leave and expanding our short-term visibility and life insurance plans for hourly restaurant managers. All of these enhancements are especially important in today's low unemployment and highly competitive environment, and they come in addition to our average hourly wage that we pay, which is on pace to pace to be more than $12 at the end of 2018. And in addition to our unique slate of benefits that we offer including discounted college tuition and tuition reimbursement for salaried and hourly employees, twice annual merit increases, paid vacation and paid sick time and stock awards at the restaurant manager level. \nWe have always been proud of our ability to attract and retain people who share our passion for creating an extraordinary guest experience, and our employees have rallied around our purpose to cultivate nurse communities where wholesome food is enjoyed every day. I want to thank them for their hard work and dedication to making Chipotle an amazing experience. \nChipotle is a very special brand. The past couple of years have presented a set of challenges, but I know that the changes we have made are the right wants to help us move toward achieving our full potential click. We will get continue to focus in our long-term success, and we'll continue to fight to preserve things that make Chipotle special. An important part of this will be to bring in a proven leader with demonstrated success in meeting the kinds of challenges we currently face. The search for a new CEO is well underway, and as soon as we have found the right person, I'll transition to the role of Executive Chairman. The board and I are committed to bringing a world-class leader with demonstrated expertise to improve execution, build guest trust and drive sales. We do not have an update on timing today, but we'll share news of our decision as soon as the process is complete. We firmly believe that a new CEO with a passion for driving excellence across every aspect of our business will be another important step in our growth, and I'm optimistic as we look forward to the next 25 years.\nI'll now turn the call over to Jack.\nExecutives: Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. Last year held its full share of challenges, but we began 2018 with optimism that the changes made so far and the changes and investments we'll make in 2018 will establish the foundation for a strong future. Our restaurant teams and field support teams are more committed than ever to delivering an excellent guest experience, and we'll continue to emphasize the guest as we significantly increase our focus and investment on training. We've established incentives for managers and field leaders to continue to elevate the guest experience and to build sales. Our second make line sales, including online mobile and catering, are the fastest-growing parts of the business, and we expect that growth to continue or even accelerate. We also plan to invest much more an existing restaurants during 2018 and beyond to create a better dining environment but ultimately, to improve the overall experience and flow of our restaurants. I'll begin by reviewing results for the fourth quarter and full year and then provide details related to our capital reinvestment plans and tax savings from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. \nFor the fourth quarter, we reported $1.1 billion in sales on comp sales growth of 0.9%. Our reported comps include a 60 basis point decrease as we lapped Chiptopia deferred revenue in Q4 of last year. If you recall, we recognized an additional 60 basis points benefit in sales comp related to the deferred revenue in Q4 2016, and now that reduces our comp in the current period. We'll have a similar decrease in the first quarter of 2018 of about 50 basis points to our comp. Our restaurant level margins were 14.9% in the quarter, and we generated $1.55 in earnings per diluted share. Our EPS in the quarter benefited by about $0.21 related to the recent U.S. tax law changes. \nFor the full year, we reported $4.5 billion of sales on a sales comp increase of 6.4%, which includes a 30 basis point benefit related to Chiptopia. Restaurant-level margins where 16.9%, and we generated limited earnings per share of $6.17. The Q4 underlying comp of 1.5% before the 60 basis effect of Chiptopia was driven by higher average check as we expanded our menu price increase to an additional 900 restaurants in November, bringing the total menu price impact during the quarter to about 240 basis points. Average check also benefited by about 200 basis points from queso. And queso continue to add about 200 basis points to the average check in January as guests are currently adding queso in a little more than 10% of our transactions. Pay traffic in the quarter was down about 3% due to the negative transaction trends that began in July of last year. \nJanuary 2018 sales comp was 3.4%. We had 1 extra trading day in the month as we opened on the New Year's Day for the first time, and that day contributed about 240 basis points and will account for just under 1% in the comp for the first quarter. Sales were diversely impacted during the first 3 weeks of January from the series of winter storms that impacted most of the country. As the weather has normalized over the past 2 weeks, our comps have been running in the 2.5% to the 3.5% range. First quarter comparisons will get tougher as we enter mid-February in March as warm weather last year caused our comps to surge, essentially bringing our normal seasonal spring sales bump earlier than normal. If our recent sales dollar trends continue through the first quarter, we would expect a comp of between 1% and 2% before the impact of Chiptopia. \nOur full year comp guide for 2018 is in the low single digits with lower sales comps expected in the first half of the year due to the tougher comparisons then improving in the second half as comparisons ease. In addition to the menu price increase last November, we completed the final round of price increases in January in about 1,000 remaining restaurants or about 40% of our restaurants. The average price increase in these markets was about 5%, and we expect resistance of around 20% or less. We expect the average check will contain to benefit the company by about 2% from guests adding queso through the first 8 months of 2018 until we lap the queso rollout in September.  Of course, all this means you will likely continue to see negative transactions until we lap the beginning of the negative transaction trend, which began in July. \nOur food costs during the quarter were 34.2%, down from 35.3% in the prior year and down from 35% in Q3. The decrease from last year was driven by menu price increases, better management of paper and packaging inventories and lower priced avocados. We expect relatively stable prices in 2018 including for avocados, which along with the price increase should lower food cost to the low to mid-33% range. California avocado growth should be on the upswing for their alternate-bearing crop this summer, and we are fortunate that the recent wildfires in California are not expected to impact supply. \nLabor costs in the fourth quarter were 27.5%, flat with the prior year. Higher wage inflation of 5% was offset by a combination of factors including labor efficiency to promotions, lower insurance and benefit costs and slight leverage from pricing. Since early 2014, through wages and benefits have increased by a cumulative 29%, we have only increased pricing by a cumulative 12%. Our restaurant managers some of the most efficient deployment we've seen in years. The labor pressures will contain at this level because of wage inflation, softer transaction trends and as we add our enhanced benefits that Steve discussed. Our labor as a percent of sales are typically flat from Q4 into Q1 although we anticipate an increase slightly in Q1 related to regulatory minimum wage increases as of January 1 combined with the reinvestment into our employees funded by the tax savings. Occupancies and cost for the fourth quarter were 7.6% of sales versus 7.4% last year. The higher occupancy costs are driven by inflation from renewals and slightly higher average rents from new restaurants. We anticipate new restaurant openings in 2018 to continue to have modestly higher average rents than existing restaurants due to refocusing our development pipeline with a heavier weighting in proven markets. As a percent of sales, occupancy for the full year should be about in line with 2017 in the low to mid-7% range as a percent of sales. Other operating cost were 15.8% of sales in the quarter, a decrease from 16.3% last year. Our marketing and promo costs were 3.8% of sales in the quarter, which is a decrease of about 100 basis points compared to last year. Our other operating costs also included 50 basis points of incremental costs related to maintenance and repairs. Maintenance and repairs is expected to remain at elevated levels during 2018, which I'll explain more fully in a few minutes.\nIn 2018, we anticipate marketing and promo activity will be at or slightly above 3% of sales. Marketing promo costs will be slightly higher in the second and third quarters with lower spending in Q1 and Q4. For the full year, we anticipate other operating cost to be about the same as last year as savings from the lower marketing and promo will be reinvested into existing restaurants with higher maintenance and repairs. With normal lower seasonal sales in the first quarter and the increased reinvestment in our restaurants, we would anticipate Q1 other operating expenses to be right around 15% of sales. So overall in Q1, though restaurant level margins are typically similar to fourth quarter with lower expected food and other operating costs and the full benefit of the price increase offset by higher maintenance and repairs investment in the investment in the special bonus for employees Q1 margin should be 16% to 16.5% range. \nG&A costs for the full year 2017 was 6.6% of sales or a total of $296 million, and this includes $30 million related to the data security incident from April 2017, $60 million in stock compensation and $8 million in our employee bonus program. During 2017 our employee bonus program underperformed our targets.\nFor the full year 2018, we anticipate G&A costs will be about $330 million, and this includes around $66 million for stock comp, $18 million for employee bonus program as expect to return to paying bonuses at our target during 2018. $12 million for one-time executive retention bonuses and stock grants and $12 million for our biannual all manager conference. We expect underlying recurring G&A to grow by about $25 million after 3 years of flat G&A despite the fact that we open more than 650 restaurants during this time. The $25 million includes the formalized and one-time special bonuses for staff related to the savings from tax rate reduction. A plan to invest a total of about $300 million in capital expenses in 2018 and increase 2017 investment of $217 million. For the first time ever, our capital investment into existing restaurants will outpace our investment in new restaurant openings. The total CapEx will be funded from casual from operations and include several components. First, in addition to normal ongoing upkeep of our restaurants for which we would typically invest around $10,000 per restaurant or around $24 million. We'll invest another $50 million to fund a new refresh and maintenance program that Steve introduced. This $50 million is a discrete one-time investment that will average about $20,000 per restaurant, and it will allow us to fully assess the interiors of every single restaurant, improve efficiencies, ensure that the environments are warm and welcoming for our guests. This focus on improving our restaurants is also driving higher maintenance and repair expenses, which we expect will continue throughout 2018.\nIn early tests, we have seen modest investments and have a significant influence on the atmosphere for our guests. In addition, we'll invest into new growth initiatives including about $45 million to continue to retrofit our digitally enhanced second make lines into existing restaurants, including new restaurants digitally enhanced second make lines will be in about a thousand restaurants by the end of the year. We'll also invest about $15 million to improve IT infrastructure, a portion of which will support and enhance our digital programs and digital experience. Our digital investments are targeted toward the fastest-growing piece of our business and will be accompanied by other digital experience enhancements and focused marketing efforts that continue to encourage digital ordering. Beyond digital, we'll invest about $10 million in designing new prototype restaurants. The results from these prototypes will inform both new restaurant design and remodels in 2019 and in 2020. \nWe also plan to invest around $25 million into initiatives around optimizing our energy uses in our restaurants and introduced better equipment to cook our food such as a new rice cooker to make our restaurants more efficient. And while investing more aggressively into existing restaurants, our development pipeline remains healthy, and we expect to build and open around 130 to 150 restaurants during 2018. The majority of the restaurants will continue to be built in our proven markets where we've had a loyal and growing customer base. New restaurants opened during 2017 performed at about 75% of our average sales volumes and continue to provide a strong return during the first year of operations. Our net restaurant will be slightly higher in 2018 as every site now incorporates the new digitally enabled second make line. \nAnd finally, we'll invest about $25 million into other general corporate initiatives, which includes the consolidation of our 2 separate offices in Denver so that we can create a more efficient and more collaborative environment. Our effective tax rate for the full year 2017 was 36.1% compared with 40.8% in 2016 and for the quarter a tax rate with 28.8% as lower quarterly tax rate resulted from remeasuring our deferred tax liability at the 21% corporate federal tax rate owing to Tax Cuts and Jobs Act becoming law in late December. The full year rate is lower than 2016 due to the tax rate changes along with lower state tax rates. \nWe expect the 2018 effective full year tax rate to be between 30% and 31% with an underlying effective tax rate to be in the 27% to 28% range. There are a few moving pieces in this new rate. Relative to our normalized tax rate of about 39% the last few years, our federal tax rate will decrease by 1,400 basis points as a result of the federal tax rate changes but state taxes will be higher by about 100 to 200 basis points due to the reduced benefit of deducting state taxes at the new lower federal tax rate. And under the new federal tax law, we can no longer expense the full cost of our employee meals for tax purposes, which is a substantial benefit that we offer our employees. That adds another 100 basis points to our tax rate. This underlying effective tax rate of 27% to 28% will then be impacted by prior and future stock-based compensation plans. We currently have deferred tax assets related to outstanding nonvested stock award that contain market and performance conditions. If market conditions are not achieved, then we may not realize the benefit of these different tax assets, which will result in higher effective tax rate of future periods. For current outstanding awards such as the 2015 and 2016 performance stock ramps, there are estimates that these awards either may not vest or may vest at lower realized values than originally anticipated. Under either scenario, we would not benefit from the initial deferred tax asset, which would negatively impact our effective tax rate by around 300 to 400 basis points. Overall, corporate tax law changes will result in tax savings of around $40 million to $50 million in 2018. We plan to invest more than 1/3 of these savings in our people, special bonuses to our crew managers and sport stack investment in employee training and enhance employee benefits the remainder of the tax savings will help fund our investment to enhance existing restaurants. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet and refinish the year with $509 million in cash and investments and generated $467 million in cash from operations during 2017. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased $77 million of our stock at an average price of $297 per share, and we repurchased $284 million of stock during the full year 2017. Even with our increased investment in existing restaurants in 2018, we still expect to do opportunistically repurchase shares throughout the year albeit at a lower level than last year. As should be expected our outlook for 2018 does not include any potential strategic changes that may be driven by a new CEO.\nDespite a challenging year, we feel that we have a lot of momentum and energy throughout the company heading into 2018. We're more committed than ever to continue to perfect our dining experience and to build our sales, the investments that we're making in our people and to growing our digital and catering business and investing your innovation wheel not only help set up a foundation for successful 2018 but also for the next 25 years. Thank you, and we'll now open lines for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is with John Glass from Morgan Stanley.\nAnalysts: First, just on top line drivers, if you could comment about in 2018 how you're viewing either product development differently or approaching market -- marketing differently. Does queso give you more confidence, for example, in more new product introductions in 2018 that drive traffic when you think about marketing the same question your approach has been nontraditional in the past, does that approach continue to do you think this is the time to pivot to may be more traditional marketing message to get traffic going again?\nExecutives: So we've learned a lot over the last year as we've pivoted toward our more traditional marketing using television, in particular. So this year, we're going to do a number of things. Our marketing plan will consist of traditionally 3 big components over the year, 3 big advertising components. So in the spring, we will launch another advertising campaign, this time though it will be using addressable TV rather than broadcast TV, which was a learning that took away from fall where a lot of that TV were reaching lapsed customers who aren't the best target for us. So we're really focusing in more with this addressable TV on the new and current customers that we have. And then in the summer, we'll head into our 25th anniversary marketing campaign, which is largely targeted toward existing customers, although certainly, it will reach new as well. And then in the fall, there will be another large advertising campaign, which again likely to include television. What so the pivot, I think, toward more traditional advertising will continue to when we started last year not to say we want more nontraditional things as we always have. Notable difference, I think, for this year will be in the addition of a much more robust CRM platform and the inclusion of a loyalty program, which we should see in the second half of the year, so that will give us the combination of this more strategic approach to advertising, particularly the use of this addressable TV along with a more robust CRM platform should allow us to reach the right customers more effectively. So there's -- so I think it is overall a pivot to slightly more traditional, if you will, advertising, but we're doing it in a very targeted way.\nAnalysts: Jack, if I could sneak in one follow-up, you gave a number of detailed items around cost items individually. Could you just -- if you're going to hit your low single-digit comp guidance for the year in 2018, where do you think store margins land on the basis of what you just described?\nExecutives: Yes, I think we'll be probably in the upper teens, maybe in the 17.5 to 18, 18.5 range something like that. A couple of percent margin means that we would delever on the labor line with labor inflation running in the mid-single digits and with only running a 2% even though it's driven by price, that means we're still running negative transactions. And so will probably be constrained in that 17.5 to 18, maybe as high as 18.5 really good operation from commodities. We've also got some of the onetime things I mentioned as well like the bonus we're going to pay for tax savings and then the additional M&R, maintenance and repair, that we're going to in addition to capital were really going to play place a heavy focus in making sure our restaurants look, feel and are a wonderful environment for our customers sites anything that's where we expect margins to hit for the year, John.\nOperator: Our next question is from Nicole Miller from Piper Jaffray.\nAnalysts: I just had 2 quick questions. The first one on point number 2 on innovation around digital and catering. How does loyalty fit into the mix there? And when might you be willing to launch a loyalty program?\nExecutives: Well, as I just said, we expect to launch a loyalty program, which is part of a larger CRM effort in the second half of the year. So the program's being designed as you speak. And so loyalty is a subject of a larger CRM effort, which will be the important part of all of our digital marketing as well as catering as marketing catering, obviously, as those are things that we market to people who we know as existing customers so they are very much linked.\nAnalysts: And will you be -- you'll get the customer data so that you can them and this is a surprise and delight or a a point and dollar-based program?\nExecutives: Well, yes, absolutely. Knowing the customer and having a one-to-one relationship with them is the central focus of it. The actual structure of the program is not something that we're talking about today but absolutely everything is on the table with regard to that.\nAnalysts: Okay. And the second question with regard to the 130 and 150 new stores, so you know how to model those? Any sequence you would offer quarterly? And are these new stores in new markets? Are they in existing markets? And is there any international growth to speak of?\nExecutives: Yes, Nicole. They should be reasonably even throughout the year. Time lines always change throughout the year, but there's nothing out of the ordinary in terms of to the quarters, and most of them will be in proven markets. We still will see that a few here and there in some of the newer markets but most of them way over -- way more than 80% should be in our proven and established market, which gives us greater confidence that they should open and generate an attractive return right out of the box.\nExecutives: And nothing planned in international.\nExecutives: And nothing planned in international right now, Nicole.\nOperator: Our next question is from David Tarantino with Robert Baird.\nAnalysts: A couple of questions on the traffic trends. Jack, on the quarter-to-date commentary, I think you sort of pointed to an underlying trend of around 2.5% to 3.5%. Can you just confirm the level of pricing that you have in that equation so that we can get to an underlying traffic number? I believe you might be running 5% pricing or higher.\nExecutives: Yes, it's right at 5%, David. There were some markets extremely high local cost, especially labor. So market by market, you'll see some markets that were a little above 5, but the overall weighted average cost country is running about 5. We typically model in about 20% resistant so that 5 converts to about 4. We might see less resistance in that to that, but we expect the benefit somewhere between 4% and 5%. And then we're running 2% added to that check because of queso. So when we're running a 3%, for example, 3% positive comp, if you assume 4% from pricing and a couple of percent from queso, you could back into a negative transaction of somewhere in the 3% range.\nAnalysts: Got it. And then your guidance for the year seems to assume that doesn't get a lot better despite everything you're doing. Is that correct? If you look at sort of the seasonally adjusted traffic trends, are you assuming much improvement? Or you're just assuming that the year-over-year number gets better when you cycle the step-down you saw in the second half of the year?\nExecutives: One, we do the assume the back half of the year because comparisons get better when we compare against July. We're comparing against the beginning of the negative transaction so we do think the transactions get better. But we have a couple of things at roll off. We have some pricing that rolls off in April. We will compare against queso launch in September and will compare against the pricing in November as well.  Of course, we hope that we will build even more momentum so we're not being overly bullish with our guidance. We're working on a number of things from an standpoint. From a digital standpoint, Mark mentioned loyalty. So we're hoping that we can spark a more positive transaction trend based on how tough it's been the last couple of years, you get that momentum going, we think this is the right level of guidance.\nAnalysts: Makes sense. And then one more if Scott Boatwright is available. There's a comment about guest satisfaction scores and the new system that you're using to measure those and some early signs being on your progress there. So I was just wondering if Scott could comment on sort of where you think you are today on those metrics and where you think you need to be to drive much better traffic trends.\nExecutives: Scott here. We are using Medaglia as our partner in this space, and we have just really started garnering the level of survey volume necessary for statistical relevance, probably over the course of the last 4 to 5 months. And we have seen pretty significant growth in overall satisfaction since September of last year with a steady increase and still in February still ahead of January although not fully baked but feel really good about our current trends. I feel like we are really regaining consumer confidence all across the country by some of the steps that we took later in last year to really shore up some of our operational deficiencies, and we'll see that continue to improve. I am encouraged by the trend at this point but to the last part of your question, I think to be best in class, we probably need to continue to improve probably another 600, 700 basis points from where we sit today.\nOperator: Our next question is from Sharon Zackfia with William Blair.\nAnalysts: A few questions. I just want to clarify, Jack, on that 1 to 2 comp for the first quarter, are you including the New Year's Day benefit in that?\nExecutives: I am, Sharon. The New Year's Day overall for the quarter will give us about 1%. So that does imply we're looking about just on top of that a 1%, positive net 1% to 2% range. And the reason it's just our sales surged significantly in the middle of February, and we're about to go up against those numbers. And if we're lucky, we'll get mild weather again but again, we have kind of normal winter weather compared to how warm it was last year, 1 to 2 is about where we expect the quarter to fall.\nAnalysts: And I guess a question on the CEO search, I think, Steve, you mentioned being a purpose-driven company and clearly, the culture has been one of the key hallmarks over time of Chipotle. As you look for that new CEO, is that purpose-driven dynamic, is that a guardrail on that search? Or would somebody come in and kind of have free rein to take Chipotle in the direction he or she thinks it should go?\nExecutives: Sure, Sharon. It's a delicate balance bringing in a new CEO. Of course, you've heard of examples where new CEOs have come in but have not really been allowed to act as a CEO, and I fully intend to have the new CEO be in charge. It's been great spending time with a number of candidates, and one thing has been consistent though and that is how strongly Chipotle has impressed these folks, and it's based in the purpose. So many of the candidates come from the restaurant industry and have been either have led number them or a key player in these brands. And while they've enjoyed a lot of success in their companies, they've never had the kind of purpose that we've had at Chipotle, which is I think very, very exciting to all of them. I think it's not lost on them that you can really have both. You can have a purpose and you can have a product that's very, very popular with consumers, and you can have a great economic model. And for 25 years, we never compromised on that. We had it all. And we need to get back on track and build momentum again, and all of the new CEOs realize that. I don't think you're going to see a situation where someone says, \"To hell with Food with Integrity  We're going to buy cheap commodity meat now and really turn this thing around.\" I just don't worry that, that kind of thing would happen.\nOperator: Our next question is from Sara Senatore with AB.\nAnalysts: One question and one follow-up, please. The question is on the CapEx and some of the investments in the existing stores. I think the comment was that you're seeing some real benefits in terms of customer experience, but is that translating into same-store sales lift? I think a lot of times in the industry we see lifts of kind of mid-single-digit range when you -- when there's some upgrades to store. So just trying to get a sense of that guest experience improvement that you're seeing is actually also translating into top line. And then I do have a question on margins.\nExecutives: This is Scott Boatwright. It is a fantastic question. Once I joined the brand last summer, I spent a great deal of time in our restaurants, really from coast to coast and recognized there was a great deal of deferred maintenance across the country that needed to be addressed to ensure that we are best en bloc and each of the traders, which we operate. Unfortunately, Sara, those changes don't really alter the the exterior of the Chipotle restaurants I'm talking about so it wouldn't garner additional traffic, but I do feel like as a great number of our guests dine in that changing the experience for those folks will, although a slow build, will contribute to the overall sales performance here in 2018.\nAnalysts: Great. And then on the margins, Jack, if you could talk a little bit about, I think, a year ago or what have you, we talked about 20% restaurant margins at 2 million AUVs, and that sounds like maybe you're looking for 18% restaurant margins roughly that number even little bit higher, granted that you're reinvesting some of the tax savings as is the rest of the industry, but I guess is that 20% number of the table? And a related question, do you rethink how we approach pricing, given that the nature of your pricing has meant that you really lagged the cost inflation by quite a bit?\nExecutives: Yes. It's a good question, and let me try to answer it this way. Let me go back to Q2 of last year when our margin was at right around 19%, 18.9% or 19%, and then let's talk about what to expect in the second quarter of this year, and that may be the best kind of way to show kind of a before-and-after because the quarter last year was right before we had the July restarted the negative transaction slide. So I would expect, Karen, that we have about the same margin in the second quarter of 2018, that we have about the same margin in the second quarter of 2018, about 19%, but there's a lot of pushes and pulls. First of all, we're having a net inflection point of about 500 to 600 basis points since the transaction trend last year. We are running positive 3 and then we switched to a negative 3. So that's 500 to 600 basis points that impacts the margin by negative about 1.6%. The ongoing labor inflation that we've seen is about 1.2%, 1.3% or so, and that's running about a 5% margin on top of our 26% labor. The menu price increases is helping us by 300 or so basis points, and so the menu price increase essentially offsets the leverage from the comp and then the labor inflation. And then we have pushes in terms of you're expecting lower marketing and little bit higher maintenance and repairs. Maintenance and repairs we think is going to be at this your item not forever item still we got these pushes and pulls. And so while our model has the ability at higher volume transaction momentum growing lever the model, we've seen us do that year after year after year, but this negative transaction is taking hits into the margin in the menu price increase, which adds 300 basis points for the model is eaten all up by the delever and then by the inflation. And so the important thing for us is to hopefully get some of these things that we're focused on to start transaction momentum, start positive transaction. And then from the menu price, we certainly are open to the idea instead of waiting for years and raising prices to perhaps labor inflation is staying at this level, perhaps we take a smaller increase every year to just kind of hold on to our margins in terms of regular ongoing inflation. So I hope that helps in terms of comparing the quarter's year-to-year it truly is a big dramatic picture since the transaction turn negative.\nOperator: Our next question is with Jason West with Credit Suisse.\nAnalysts: I'm just trying to understand the level of investment you guys need to make in the stores. You talked about some refresh and equipment and beyond, lighting, things like that. But then you also touched on more significant prototype change with maybe things like mobile ordering pickup stations and things like that. So what is the plan there? Because I know this year it sounds like more of a reflex plan, but then is it moral for full remodel in the future? Or are you doing both at the same time? Can you talk about that a bit?\nExecutives: It's actually both at the same time. It's really low hanging fruit to change light bulbs and to with new deep thirds on the service line and the new stainless steel event things like this that really costs customers to notice that there's something different. It's shinier, it's brighter, it's cleaner. And we're going to continue to find those kinds of opportunities. But right now, we have engaged with 3 different architectural firms to create the next version of the Chipotle experience, and we've deliberately asked them to remodel existing restaurants so that this new -- this new experience can be applied to existing restaurants as well as brand-new restaurants, and we'll start to see some of those come online shortly. We've got 3 of them now mocked up as models in full-scale cardboard models, and we walked in them and what that experience is going to be like. It's really excited it combines the traditional Chipotle experience along with things like digital pickup, whether it's in-store digital or out-of-store digital and grab and go and also allows for potential new menu items. So really exciting stuff and really preparing ourselves for the next 25 years.\nOperator: Our next question is with Karen Holthouse with Goldman Sachs.\nAnalysts: Another question on the side of things. So with this [ $50  ] million of spending on really it's maintenance this year, it sounds like you roll off some of that so that moves more without going off get you sort of a more flexibility to then increase the unit growth? Or what's sort of the governing factor on maybe getting back to prior peaks of unit growth?\nExecutives: Yes, I think on a theoretical basis, it's but I don't think it's a matter to access to capital because we don't have access to capital through our operations and through our balance sheet to do the remodels, to do the repairs that Steve talked about that are bringing our restaurant at the standard. And we can accelerate growth. I think the biggest driver right now is he want to give our ops teams a chance to really get on solid footing. The things that Scott has put into place has really started to take hold. We're going to put a huge emphasis on training, refocus on training so that we can have confidence that all of our teams, all of our managers all of our crews will know what our standards are. They can actually put the standards and will deliver including great throughput. We haven't had a great throughput here in the last few years, and that takes a lot of training. So the new store growth will accelerate that is much more about how we feel about the ops teams and are on solid footing our training programs how you really take hold, and then I think will redeploy capital into the new store. So I wouldn't say this because capital brings up that automatically would move into new store, and we're not commenting specifically on 2019 right now. I think it'd be prudent for us to get through at least half, if not 3 quarters of, 2018 and then we'll at that time and talk about what 2019 looks like for growth.\nOperator: Our final question is with Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays.\nAnalysts: Steve, I believe it was last quarter you talked about the next team, whether it was for menu innovation or segments and whatnot. I know you talked about how queso was like the first foray. I'm just wondering with greater time under your belt I should think about that next team what's your early evolution around? I think you mentioned new segments or new dayparts. How would you prioritize the different opportunities that perhaps they're coming up on you think about the next many years? And I know you just mentioned menu items. So what do you think kind of the genesis of what's the outcome of that next team in terms of over the next year or so?\nExecutives: Sure. I think the next team's biggest opportunity is to always look at our 4 menu and make sure that we're cooking better food. We're sourcing better food, we have better ingredients, we're improving our preparation techniques, our cooking techniques our serving techniques. It's what drove our business for the first couple of decades taking a core group of menu items and continually improving them, not only through Food with Integrity but through better restaurant execution. So that's a priority. But additionally, they need to work on new menu items and they have a whole host of menu items. The new menu items at a place like Chipotle is tricky though. It's tricky not only because we've had the same menu for basically 25 years but because of the linear format. It's not like you can put a whole new thing up on the menu board like in a typical fast food place. Ingredients sort of become part of the overall offering, so it's a tricky proposition. But it's something that we're working really, really hard on. There are exciting new offerings that are around things like salads and different kinds of grains and also an exploration of traditional things like -- and these are things that customers are asking for, things like nachos and quesadillas. And so how to integrate those into our service format so we can maintain throughput and sort of the level of execution that we relied on in the past is tricky so that's something that they're focusing on also.\nAnalysts: Got it. And then, Jack, I just want to clarify. I think you said more than 1/3 of the tax savings you're going to reinvest. It sounds like a lot of it is more onetime in nature you say something about the remaining 2/3 and thought you said maybe he'd be reinvesting that as well or should we assume that, that the remainder gets returned to shareholders?\nExecutives: Well, in essence, what we said was it will help us fund the increase in CapEx, but we'll continue to generate more than enough capital to support the operations to support our CapEx we stole this on the balance sheet so you can expected to continue to return cash to shareholder, not necessarily incremental amount. I think the incremental amount that we're getting from taxes is going to be funneled into the CapEx into our existing restaurants. We still have room that we can return some of our capital to shareholders as well through buyback.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call over back to Mark Alexee for closing remarks.\nExecutives: We look forward to sharing our Q1 results for you, which is planned for April 24. Okay.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.\nOperator: Greetings, and welcome to Chipotle Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mark Alexee, Investor Relations Manager.

Scott Boatwright, Chief Restaurant Officer; Mark Crumpacker, our Chief Marketing and Strategy Officer; Curt Garner, Chief Digital and Information Officer; and Laurie Schalow, Chief Communications Officer, are also with us and available during the Q&A period.\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to Steve.\nExecutives: Thanks, Mark, and good afternoon, everyone. In 2018, Chipotle will celebrate its 25th anniversary. This is an ideal time to reflect on the things that have contributed to our success over the past 25 years while at the same time provide an update on the fundamental changes we are making across the business to enable us to get back on a strong growth trajectory and realize our vast potential. \nAs I think back on the past 25 years, I'm extremely proud of the unique company we've created. Our success is based on our passion for serving great-tasting, wholesome food that's served in an interactive environment. It has been our vision and the commitment of doing what is right for our guests, employees, suppliers and farmers, the environment and animals well before these things were common in the world of fast food, all while delivering a superior economic model that has led to our success. When I started Chipotle, I wanted to show that just because food is served fast doesn't mean it has to be a typical fast food experience. It wasn't a commonly held view at the time, but it certainly has paid off. I continue to believe that this approach to serving nutritious, wholesome and delicious food remains highly valued by our guests and can deliver strong returns to our shareholders.\nNow after 25 years, we must navigate new challenges by continuing to evolve how we approach the business. Our results for the quarter clearly show that there is still work to be done to restore strong growth and customer trust. And today, I want to discuss the progress we're making on a number of initiatives that will transform how we manage the company and that will provide a solid foundation for how we build the business going forward. \nToday, I want to talk about 3 key areas of focus: first, our operational changes and efforts to perfect the guest experience; second, enhancing the guest experience through innovations in digital and catering; and third, reinvesting in our existing restaurants to enhance guest convenience and improve the appearance and function of our restaurants. In addition, I'll provide an update on our CEO search. \nFirst, let me discuss the operational changes and efforts to perfect the dining experience. After spending time in our restaurants over the past few months, I've seen firsthand the impact Scott Boatwright and his team are having on our operations. Shifting our operational culture requires leadership, determination and time to retrain and build new habits. Our field leaders are spending time with managers to focus on what it takes to effectively train our teams to deliver an excellent guest experience. Scott and his team have formalized the role of the manager and the role of the field leader to ensure all their efforts are focused on the guest experience. And our support teams are building extensive, detailed trading programs to provide the necessary tools for this type of change. We're also launching a dedicated, centralized training program based in Denver. This program combines classroom teaching, which is new to Chipotle, with live, in-store training in a certified Chipotle restaurant. The curriculum has been tailored to our field leaders to ensure we are effectively addressing the most important elements of delivering a great guest experience. That effort is beginning to pay off as we develop consistency around the speed of service and improving hospitality from every crew member. \nWe're revisiting the concept of throughput, which has historically been an incredible strength of our business. As our training program continues to take hold, our teams will be primed to refocus on delivering excellent throughput in the restaurant again and will be looking at various ways to incentivize terrific throughput. When executed correctly with well-trained crew, throughput is one of the best tools we've had to build sales and to build our brand. \nWe also completed the restructuring of our field leadership, reducing the number of regions and eliminating unnecessary layers above the restaurant. Our field leader ratios have been reduced, enabling our strong field leaders to spend more time in each restaurant. This has had a direct and lasting impact on the restaurant teams. \nAnd over the past 6 months, we've implemented a new guest satisfaction system in our restaurants, and we are encouraged by improvements we've seen across all measures, including key areas of friendliness and ease of ordering. These renewed efforts come in addition to the incentive program changes we instituted at the restaurant level 1 year ago, which makes the guest experience a key component of incentive compensation for our restaurant and field teams. \nWith early signs of an improved guest experience, we are excited to celebrate our 25th anniversary with all of our guests, employees and partners. We will incorporate the 25th anniversary celebration into many of our marketing and promotional campaigns this year, and it will be a rallying point for our brand. We have passionate and loyal fans that love Chipotle, and it's a great opportunity to share their stories along with reminding our guests of all the things that make us unique and special. We'll share more of this campaign with you on our first quarter call.\nNow let me turn to how we are enhancing the guest experience to build sales through innovations in digital and catering. It's clear we must also ensure that we are offering new and convenient ways for our guests to interact with Chipotle. For much of our 25-year history, innovation at Chipotle rightfully focused on sourcing better ingredients, improving our cooking techniques and making our kitchens and equipment more efficient. But over the last year, we've been building new competencies around improving the guest experience through technology and testing new or enhanced offerings. Each of these is designed to improve convenience, add interest to our menu and deliver a better overall experience for our guests. Our digital sales continue to be the fastest-growing part of our business. We hit new records in the fourth quarter as our second make-line sales were up 33% over the prior year. Our digital sales mix was 8.6% of sales, while 2 of our regions have digital sales of more than 10% of their overall mix. We continue to be optimistic as we further market this capability and as guests increasingly order Chipotle through digital platforms. \nThis digital sales growth has been led by mobile ordering, which is up 50% over last year, and the increase has been driven by the new version of our mobile app for Apple and Android. The app's new features include quick reorder of favorite or recent orders and the ability to receive, store and redeem offers. The app also introduces new mobile pay options, a more user-friendly store locator, and a streamlined user experience with enhanced design, and guest response has been consistently positive since the launch. For instance, average monthly users on mobile have more than doubled since the release of the app. \nWe're also seeing higher guest satisfaction in the restaurants that have the new second make-line, and we've seen further reduction in guest wait times to under 15 minutes as we continue to optimize our Smarter Pickup Times. In 2018, we will accelerate the roll-out of our digitally enabled second make-lines. These new lines enable a faster and more accurate experience for our digital customers and allow our crews to more easily support the higher sales volumes. Cumulatively, including new restaurants, we expect to have at least 30% of our restaurants outfitted with these new second make-lines by the end of 2018. We're prioritizing our markets and targeting locations that currently have the highest digital sales volumes to install these new make-lines. \nWe're also testing new catering offerings, which include options for smaller groups, more convenient packaging and new lower-priced options, all of which should help accelerate growth. The test includes catering options for as low as $9 per person and for groups as small as 10 people compared to our current catering, which requires a minimum of 20 people starting at prices of $12 a person. We offer delivery support for catering in about 40% of our restaurants now, and we look forward to expanding this ahead of our peak graduation season. With these initiatives taking hold, our catering sales have grown 20% over the last year. Catering is only a little more than 1% of our sales today with tremendous opportunity for growth in the future. \nWe're also creating new restaurant designs which are optimized for mobile ordering, more ordering options, better beverage presentation and more comfortable dining areas. These new designs have the ability to be applied to our existing restaurants and to any new restaurants that we build. Additionally, we'll reinvest in our existing restaurant base as we launch a significant refresh and maintenance effort to improve the experience. We are replacing dim lighting, upgrading equipment on our service lines and addressing all areas where restaurants have become warm, both inside and outside. We'll continue to expand our digital infrastructure at our restaurants, and we'll also replace aging equipment. Some of these projects are relatively small in scope but with the potential to deliver a significant impact. Jack is going to talk in more detail on the financial impacts of these initiatives.\nChipotle has always been a purpose-driven company. We've had a relentless commitment to doing what's right for our guests and our employees. This year, we will invest more than 1/3 of our anticipated tax savings in our restaurant and support teams through a special bonus and expanded benefits. We will first invest more toward training programs for employees, including the formalized classroom program that we are establishing in Denver. We're also announcing a special bonus program for all employees this year from hourly crew, who will be eligible to earn $250 special bonus; to our restaurant general managers, who will be eligible to earn $1,000 special bonus. And we are expanding our competitive benefits program with paid maternity and paternity leave and expanding our short-term disability and life insurance plans for hourly restaurant managers. All of these enhancements are especially important in today's low unemployment and highly competitive environment, and they come in addition to our average hourly wage that we pay, which is on pace to be more than $12 at the end of 2018. And in addition to our unique slate of benefits that we offer, including discounted college tuition and tuition reimbursement for salaried and hourly employees, twice annual merit increases, paid vacation and paid sick time, and stock awards at the restaurant manager level. \nWe have always been proud of our ability to attract and retain people who share our passion for creating an extraordinary guest experience, and our employees have rallied around our purpose to cultivate nourished communities where wholesome food is enjoyed every day. I want to thank them for their hard work and dedication to making Chipotle an amazing experience. \nChipotle is a very special brand. The past couple of years have presented a set of challenges, but I know that the changes we have made are the right ones to help us move toward achieving our full potential click. We will continue to focus on our long-term success, and we'll continue to fight to preserve things that make Chipotle special. An important part of this will be to bring in a proven leader with demonstrated success in meeting the kinds of challenges we currently face. The search for a new CEO is well underway. And as soon as we have found the right person, I'll transition to the role of Executive Chairman. The board and I are committed to bringing in a world-class leader with demonstrated expertise to improve execution, build guest trust and drive sales. We do not have an update on timing today, but we'll share news of our decision as soon as the process is complete. We firmly believe that a new CEO with a passion for driving excellence across every aspect of our business will be another important step in our growth, and I'm optimistic as we look forward to the next 25 years.\nI'll now turn the call over to Jack.\nExecutives: Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. Last year held its full share of challenges, but we began 2018 with optimism that the changes made so far and the changes and investments we will make in 2018 will establish the foundation for a strong future. Our restaurant teams and field support teams are more committed than ever to delivering an excellent guest experience, and we'll continue to emphasize the guest as we significantly increase our focus and investment on training. We've established incentives for our managers and field leaders to continue to elevate the guest experience and to build sales. Our second make-line sales, including online, mobile and catering, are the fastest-growing parts of the business, and we expect that growth to continue or even accelerate. We also plan to invest much more in our existing restaurants during 2018 and beyond to create a better dining environment but ultimately to improve the overall experience and flow of our restaurants. \nI'll begin by reviewing results for the fourth quarter and full year and then provide details related to our capital reinvestment plans and tax savings from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. \nFor the fourth quarter, we reported $1.1 billion in sales on comp sales growth of 0.9%. Our reported comps include a 60 basis point decrease as we lapped Chiptopia deferred revenue in Q4 of last year. If you recall, we recognized an additional 60 basis point benefit in sales comp related to the deferred revenue in Q4 2016, and now that reduces our comp in the current period. We'll have a similar decrease in the first quarter of 2018 of about 50 basis points to our comp. Our restaurant level margins were 14.9% in the quarter, and we generated $1.55 in earnings per diluted share. Our EPS in the quarter benefited by about $0.21 related to the recent U.S. tax law changes. \nFor the full year, we reported $4.5 billion of sales on a sales comp increase of 6.4%, which includes a 30 basis point benefit related to Chiptopia. Restaurant-level margins were 16.9%, and we generated diluted earnings per share of $6.17. The Q4 underlying comp of 1.5% before the 60 basis point effect of Chiptopia was driven by a higher average check as we expanded our menu price increase to an additional 900 restaurants in November, bringing the total menu price impact during the quarter to about 240 basis points. Average check also benefited by about 200 basis points from queso, and queso continued to add about 200 basis points to the average check in January as guests are currently adding queso in a little more than 10% of our transactions. Pay traffic in the quarter was down about 3% due to the negative transaction trends that began in July of last year. \nJanuary 2018 sales comp was 3.4%. We had one extra trading day in the month as we opened on New Year's Day for the first time, and that day contributed about 240 basis points and will account for just under 1% in the comp for the first quarter. Sales were adversely impacted during the first 3 weeks of January from the series of winter storms that impacted most of the country. As the weather has normalized over the past 2 weeks, our comps have been running in the 2.5% to the 3.5% range. \nFirst quarter comparisons will get tougher as we enter mid-February and March as warm weather last year caused our comps to surge, essentially bringing our normal seasonal spring sales bump earlier than normal. If our recent sales dollar trends continue through the first quarter, we would expect a comp of between 1% and 2% before the impact of Chiptopia. \nOur full year comp guidance for 2018 is in the low single digits, with lower sales comps expected in the first half of the year due to the tougher comparisons and then improving in the second half as comparisons ease. In addition to the menu price increase last November, we completed the final round of price increases in January in about 1,000 remaining restaurants or about 40% of our restaurants. The average price increase in these markets was about 5%, and we expect resistance of around 20% or less. We expect the average check will continue to benefit by -- benefit the comp by about 2% from guests adding queso through the first 8 months of 2018 until we lap the queso roll-out in September.  Of course, all this means we will likely continue to see negative transactions until we lap the beginning of the negative transaction trend, which began in July. \nFood costs during the quarter were 34.2%, down from 35.3% in the prior year and down from 35% in Q3. The decrease from last year was driven by menu price increases, better management of paper and packaging inventories and lower priced avocados. We expect relatively stable prices in 2018, including for avocados, which along with the price increase should lower our food cost to the low to mid-33% range. California avocado growth should be on the upswing for their alternate bearing crop this summer, and we are fortunate that the recent wildfires in California are not expected to impact supply. \nLabor costs in the fourth quarter were 27.5%, flat with the prior year. Higher wage inflation of 5% was offset by a combination of factors, including labor efficiencies due to fewer promotions, lower insurance and benefit costs and slight leverage from pricing. Since early 2014, true wages and benefits have increased by a cumulative 29% but we have only increased pricing by a cumulative 12%. Our restaurant managers and crews are running some of the most efficient restaurant labor deployment we have seen in years. The labor pressures will continue at this level because of wage inflation, softer transaction trends and as we add our enhanced benefits that Steve discussed. Our labor as a percent of sales are typically flat from Q4 into Q1, although we anticipate it to increase slightly in Q1 related to regulatory minimum wage increases as of January 1, combined with the reinvestment into our employees funded by the tax savings. \nOccupancy costs for the fourth quarter were 7.6% of sales versus 7.4% last year. The higher occupancy costs are driven by inflation from renewals and slightly higher average rents from new restaurants. We anticipate new restaurant openings in 2018 to continue to have modestly higher average rents than existing restaurants due to refocusing our development pipeline with a heavier weighting toward proven markets. As a percentage of sales, occupancy for the full year should be about in line with 2017 in the low to mid-7% range as a percent of sales. \nOther operating costs were 15.8% of sales in the quarter, a decrease from 16.3% last year. Our marketing and promo costs were 3.8% of sales in the quarter, which is a decrease of about 100 basis points compared to last year. Our other operating costs also included 50 basis points of incremental costs related to maintenance and repairs. Maintenance and repairs is expected to remain at elevated levels during 2018, which I'll explain more fully in a few minutes.\nIn 2018, we anticipate marketing and promo activity will be at or slightly above 3% of sales. Marketing and promo costs will be slightly higher in the second and third quarters, with lower spending in Q1 and Q4. For the full year, we anticipate other operating costs to be about the same as last year as savings from the lower marketing and promo will be reinvested into existing restaurants with higher maintenance and repairs. With normal lower seasonal sales in the first quarter and the increased reinvestment in our restaurants, we would anticipate Q1 other operating expenses to be right around 15% of sales. \nSo overall, in Q1, the restaurant level margins are typically similar to fourth quarter with lower expected food and other operating costs and the full benefit of the price increase offset by higher maintenance and repairs investment and the investment in the special bonus for employees, Q1 margin should be in the 16% to 16.5% range. \nG&A costs for the full year 2017 were 6.6% of sales or a total of $296 million, and this includes $30 million related to the data security incident from April 2017, $60 million in stock compensation and $8 million in our employee bonus program. During 2017, our employee bonus program underperformed our targets. For the full year 2018, we anticipate G&A costs will be about $330 million, and this includes around $66 million for stock comp, $18 million for employee bonus program as we expect to return to paying bonuses at our target during 2018, $12 million for one-time executive retention bonuses and stock grants and $12 million for our biennial All Manager Conference. We expect underlying recurring G&A to grow by about $25 million after 3 years of flat G&A despite the fact that we opened more than 650 restaurants during this time. The $25 million includes the formalized new training programs and the one-time special bonuses for staff related to the savings from tax rate reduction. \nWe plan to invest a total of about $300 million in capital expenses in 2018, an increase from our 2017 investment of $217 million. For the first time ever, our capital investment into existing restaurants will outpace our investment in new restaurant openings. The total CapEx will be funded from our cash flow from operations and include several components: First, in addition to normal ongoing upkeep of a restaurant for which we would typically invest around $10,000 per restaurant or around $24 million, we'll invest another $50 million to fund a new refresh and maintenance program that Steve introduced. This $50 million is a discrete, one-time investment that will average about $20,000 per restaurant, and it will allow us to fully assess the interiors of every single restaurant, improve efficiencies, ensure that the environments are warm and welcoming for our guests. This focus on improving our restaurants is also driving higher maintenance and repair expenses, which we expect will continue throughout 2018. In early tests, we have seen modest investments can have a significant influence on the atmosphere for our guests. \nIn addition, we'll invest into new growth initiatives, including about $45 million to continue to retrofit our digitally enhanced second make-lines into existing restaurants. Including new restaurants, the digitally enhanced second make-line will be in about 1,000 restaurants by the end of the year. We'll also invest about $15 million to improve IT infrastructure, a portion of which will support and enhance our digital programs and digital experience. Our digital investments are targeted toward the fastest-growing piece of our business and will be accompanied by other digital experience enhancements and focused marketing efforts that continue to encourage digital ordering. \nBeyond digital, we'll invest about $10 million in designing new prototype restaurants. The results from these prototypes will inform both new restaurant design and remodels of our older restaurants in 2019 and in 2020. We also plan to invest around $25 million into initiatives around optimizing our energy uses in our restaurants and introduce better equipment to cook our food, such as a new rice cooker to make our restaurants more efficient. \nAnd while we're investing more aggressively into our existing restaurants, our development pipeline remains healthy and we expect to build and open around 130 to 150 new restaurants during 2018. The majority of new restaurants will continue to be built in our proven markets where we've had a loyal and growing customer base. New restaurants opened during 2017 performed at about 75% of our average sales volumes and continue to provide a strong return during the first year of operations. Our net cost to build these restaurants will be slightly higher in 2018 as every site now incorporates the new digitally enabled second make-line. \nAnd finally, we'll invest about $25 million into other general corporate initiatives, which includes the consolidation of our 2 separate offices in Denver so that we can create a more efficient and more collaborative environment. \nEffective tax rate for the full year 2017 was 36.1% compared with 40.8% in 2016. And for the quarter, our tax rate was 28.8%. This lower quarterly tax rate resulted from remeasuring our deferred tax liability at the 21% corporate federal tax rate following to Tax Cuts and Jobs Act becoming law in late December. The full year rate is lower than 2016 due to the tax rate changes along with lower state tax rates. \nWe expect the 2018 effective full year tax rate to be between 30% and 31%, with an underlying effective tax rate to be in the 27% to 28% range. There are a few moving pieces in this new rate. Relative to our normalized tax rate of about 39% the last few years our federal tax rate will decrease by 1,400 basis points as a result of the federal tax rate changes. But [indiscernible] has decreased, our state taxes will be higher by about 100 to 200 basis points due to the reduced benefit of deducting state taxes at the new lower federal tax rate. And under the new federal tax law, we can no longer expense the full cost of our employee meals for tax purposes, which is a substantial benefit that we offer our employees. That adds another 100 basis points to our tax rate. \nThis underlying effective tax rate of 27% to 28% will then be impacted by prior and future stock-based compensation plans. We currently have deferred tax assets related to outstanding nonvested stock award that contain market and performance conditions. If market conditions are not achieved, then we may not realize the benefit of this deferred tax asset, which will result in a higher effective tax rate at future periods. For current outstanding awards, such as the 2015 and 2016 performance stock grant, there are estimates that these awards either may not vest or may vest at lower realized values than originally anticipated. Under either scenario, we would not benefit from the initial deferred tax asset, which would negatively impact our effective tax rate by around 300 to 400 basis points. \nOverall, corporate tax law changes will result in tax savings of around $40 million to $50 million in 2018. We plan to invest more than 1/3 of these savings in our people with investments in special bonuses to our crew, managers and support staff, investment in employee training and enhanced employee benefits. The remainder of the tax savings will help fund our investment to enhance existing restaurants. \nWe continue to maintain a strong balance sheet, and we finished the year with $509 million in cash and investments and generated $467 million in cash from operations during 2017. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased $77 million of our stock at an average price of $297 per share, and we repurchased $284 million in stock during the full year 2017. Even with our increased investment in existing restaurants in 2018, we still expect to do opportunistically repurchase shares throughout the year albeit at a lower level than last year. As should be expected, our outlook for 2018 does not include any potential strategic changes that may be driven by a new CEO.\nDespite a challenging year, we feel that we have a lot of momentum and energy throughout the company heading into 2018. We're more committed than ever to continue to perfect our dining experience and to build our sales. The investments that we're making in our people and to growing our digital and catering business and investing in new innovation will not only help set up the foundation for a successful 2018 but also for the next 25 years. \nThank you, and we'll now open the lines for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is with John Glass from Morgan Stanley.\nAnalysts: First, just on top line drivers, if you could comment about, in 2018, how you're viewing either product development differently or approaching marketing differently. Does queso give you more confidence, for example, in more new product introductions in 2018 that drive traffic? When you think about marketing, the same question, your approach has been nontraditional in the past. Does that approach continue to work? Or do you think that this is the time to pivot to maybe more traditional marketing message to get traffic going again?\nExecutives: Thanks, John. So we've learned a lot over the last year as we pivoted toward more traditional marketing using television, in particular. So this year, we're going to do a number of things. Our marketing plan will consist -- traditionally has 3 big components over the year, big -- 3 big advertising components. So in the spring, we will launch another advertising campaign. This time though, it will be using addressable TV rather than broadcast TV, which was a learning that we took away from fall, where a lot of that TV were reaching lapsed customers who aren't the best target for us. So we're really focusing in more with this addressable TV on the new and current customers that we have. And then in the summer, we'll head into our 25th anniversary marketing campaign, which is largely targeted toward existing customers, although certainly, it will reach new as well. And then in the fall, there will be another large advertising campaign, which again is likely to include television. What I -- so the pivot, I think, toward more traditional advertising will continue, the one that we started last year. That's not to say that we won't do more nontraditional things as we always have. The notable difference, I think, for this year will be in the addition of a much more robust CRM platform and the inclusion of a loyalty program, which we should see in the second half of the year. So that will give us -- the combination of this more strategic approach to advertising, particularly the use of this addressable TV, along with a more robust CRM platform should allow us to reach the right customers more effectively. So there's -- so I think it is overall a pivot to slightly more traditional, if you will, advertising, but we're doing it in a very targeted way.\nAnalysts: Jack, if I could just sneak in one follow-up. You gave a number of detailed items around cost items individually. Could you just -- if you're going to hit -- if you were to hit your low single-digit comp guidance for the year in 2018, where do you think store margins land on the basis of what you just described?\nExecutives: Yes, John, I think we'll be in the -- probably in the upper teens, maybe in the 17.5% to 18%, 18.5% range, something like that. A couple of percent margin means that we would delever on the labor line, with labor inflation running in the mid-single digits and with -- only running a 2%. Even though that's driven by price, that means we're still running negative transactions. And so I think it would be in that -- probably constrained in that 17.5% to 18%, maybe as high as 18.5%, with really good cooperation from commodities. We've also got some of the onetime things I mentioned as well, like the bonus that we're going to pay for tax savings and then the additional M&R, maintenance and repair, that we're going to in addition to extra capital. We're really going to place a heavy focus on making sure our restaurants look, feel and are a wonderful environment for our customer site. I think that's about where you can expect margins to hit for the year, John.\nOperator: Our next question is with Nicole Miller from Piper Jaffray.\nAnalysts: I just had 2 quick questions. The first one, on point number two on innovations around digital and catering, how does loyalty fit into the mix there? And when might you be willing to launch a loyalty program?\nExecutives: Well, as I just said, we expect to launch a loyalty program, which is part of a larger CRM effort, in the second half of the year. So the program is being designed as we speak. And so loyalty is a subset of a larger CRM effort, which will be an important part of all of our digital marketing as well as catering -- as marketing, catering, obviously, as those are things that we market to people who we know as existing customers. So they're very much linked.\nAnalysts: And will you be -- you'll get the customer data so that you can reach out to them and this is a surprise and delight or a point dollar-based program?\nExecutives: Well, yes, I mean, absolutely. I mean, the -- Knowing the customer and having a one-to-one relationship with them is the central focus of it. The actual structure of the program is not something that we're talking about today, but absolutely, everything is on the table with regard to that.\nAnalysts: Okay. And then just a second question with regards to the 130 and 150 new stores, so how to model those. Any sequence you would offer quarterly? And then are these new stores in new markets? Are they in existing markets? And is there any international growth to speak of?\nExecutives: Yes, Nicole. They should be reasonably even field throughout the year. Time lines always change throughout the year, but there's nothing out of the ordinary in terms of the way that they fall into the quarters. And most of them will be in proven markets. We still will see the few here and there in some of the newer markets, but most of them way over -- way more than 80% should be in our proven and established market, which gives us greater confidence that they should open and generate an attractive return right out of the box.\nExecutives: And none planned in international.\nExecutives: And nothing planned in international right now, Nicole.\nOperator: Our next question is with David Tarantino with Robert Baird.\nAnalysts: A couple of questions on the traffic trends. First, Jack, on the quarter-to-date commentary, I think you sort of pointed to an underlying trend of around 2.5% to 3.5%. Can you just confirm the level of pricing that you have in that equation so that we can get to kind of an underlying traffic number? I believe you might be running 5% pricing or higher, plus the [indiscernible].\nExecutives: Yes, it's right at 5%, David. There were some markets that had extremely high local cost, especially labor. So market by market, you would see some markets that were a little above 5%, but the overall weighted average across the country is running about 5%. We typically model in about a 20% resistance so that 5% converts to about 4%. We might see less resistance than that but -- so I would expect the comp to benefit somewhere between 4% and 5%. And then we're running 2% added to the check because of queso. So when we're running a 3%, for example, 3% positive comp, if you assume 4% from pricing and a couple of percent from queso, you could back into a negative transaction of somewhere in the 3% range.\nAnalysts: Got it. And then your guidance for the year seems to assume that doesn't get an awful lot better despite everything you're doing. Is that correct? If you look at sort of the seasonally adjusted traffic trends, are you assuming much improvement? Or are you just assuming that the year-over-year number gets better when you cycle the step-down you saw in the second half of the year?\nExecutives: Well, there's a couple of things, David. One, we do assume the back half of the year, the underlying trends do get better because comparisons get better when we compare against July. We're comparing against the beginning of the negative transaction. So we do think the transactions get better. But we have a couple of things also that roll off. We have some pricing that rolls off in April. We will compare against queso launch in September, and we'll compare against the pricing in November as well. Of course, we hope that we will build even more momentum. So we're not being overly bullish with our guidance. We're working on a number of things from an ops standpoint. From a digital standpoint, Mark mentioned loyalty. So we're hoping that we can spark a more positive transaction trend, but based on how tough it's been the last couple of years, to get that momentum going, we think this is the right level of guidance.\nAnalysts: Makes sense. And then one more if Scott Boatwright is available to answer. There's a comment about guest satisfaction scores and the new system that you're using to measure those and some early signs being on your progress there. So I was just wondering if Scott could comment on sort of where you think you are today on those metrics and where you think you need to be to drive much better traffic trends.\nExecutives: David, Scott here. We are using Medallia as our partner in this space, and we have just really started garnering the level of survey volume necessary for statistical relevance probably over the course of the last 4 to 5 months. And we have seen pretty significant growth in overall satisfaction since September of last year with a steady increase and still -- and February still ahead of January although not fully baked but feel really good about our current trends. I feel like we are really regaining consumer confidence all across the country by some of the steps that we took later in last year to really shore up some of our operational deficiencies, and we'll see that to continue to improve. I am encouraged by the trend at this point. But to the last part of your question, I think to be best in class, we probably need to continue to improve probably another 600, 700 basis points from where we sit today.\nOperator: Our next question is with Sharon Zackfia with William Blair.\nAnalysts: A few questions. I just want to clarify, Jack, on that 1% to 2% comp for the first quarter, are you including the New Year's Day benefit in that?\nExecutives: I am, Sharon, yes. The New Year's Day overall for the quarter will give us about 1%. So that does imply that we're looking about just on top of that a 1%, positive net 1% to 2% range. And the reason is just that our sales really surged significantly in the middle of February, and we're about to go up against those numbers. So if we're lucky, we'll get mild weather again, but again, we have kind of normal winter weather compared to how warm it was last year. 1% to 2% is about where we expect the quarter to fall.\nAnalysts: Okay. And then I guess a question on the CEO search. I think, Steve, you mentioned being a purpose-driven company, and clearly, the culture has been one of the key hallmarks over time of Chipotle. As you look for that new CEO, is that -- purpose-driven dynamic, is that a guardrail on that search? Or would somebody come in and kind of have free rein to take Chipotle in the direction he or she thinks it should go?\nExecutives: Sure, Sharon. It's a delicate balance bringing in a new CEO. Of course, you've heard of examples where new CEOs have come in but have not really been allowed to act as a CEO, and I fully intend to have the new CEO be in charge. It's been great spending time with a number of candidates. And one thing has been consistent though and that is how strongly Chipotle has impressed these folks and it's based in the purpose. So many of the candidates come from the restaurant industry and have been -- either have led them or been a key player in these brands. And while they've enjoyed a lot of success in their companies, they've never had the kind of purpose that we've had at Chipotle, which is, I think, very, very exciting to all of them. I think it's not lost on them that you can really have both. You can have a purpose and you can have a product that's very, very popular with consumers, and you can have a great economic model. And for 25 years, we never compromised on that. We had it all. And we need to get back on track and build momentum again, and all of the new CEOs realize that. I don't think you're going to see a situation where someone says, \"To hell with Food with Integrity. We're going to buy cheap commodity meat now and really turn this thing around.\" I just don't -- I don't worry that, that kind of a thing would happen.\nOperator: Our next question is with [ Sara Centrum ] with [ AB ].\nAnalysts: One question and one follow-up, please. So the question is on the CapEx and some of the investment in the existing stores. I think the comment was that you're seeing some real benefits in terms of customer experience, but is that translating into same-store sales lift? I think a lot of times in the industry, we see lifts in the kind of mid-single-digit range when you -- when there are some upgrades to store. So just trying to get a sense of that guest experience improvement that you're seeing is actually also translating into top line. And then I do have a question on margins.\nExecutives: [ Sara ], this is Scott Boatwright. It's a fantastic question. Once I joined the brand back last summer, I spent a great deal of time in our restaurants really from coast to coast and recognized there was a great deal of deferred maintenance across the country that needed to be addressed to ensure that we are best on block and each of the trade areas in which we operate. Unfortunately, [ Sara ], those changes don't really alter the facade or the exterior of the Chipotle restaurants -- and I'm talking about. So it wouldn't garner additional traffic, but I do feel like as a great number of our guests dine in that changing the experience for those folks will -- although a slow build, will contribute to the overall sales performance here in 2018.\nAnalysts: Great. And then just on the margins, Jack, if you could talk a little bit about -- I think, a year ago or what have you, we talked about 20% restaurant margins at $2 million AUVs, and that sounds like maybe you're looking for 18% restaurant margins that -- roughly that number, even little bit higher, granted that you're reinvesting some of the tax savings as is the rest of the industry. But I guess is that 20% number off the table? And a related question, do you rethink how you approach pricing given that the nature of your pricing has meant that you've really lagged the cost inflation by quite a bit?\nExecutives: Yes. It's a good question, and let me try to answer it this way. Let me go back to Q2 of last year when our margin was at -- right around 19%, 18.9% or 19%, and then let's talk about what we can expect in the second quarter of this year, and that might be the best kind of way to show kind of before and after because second quarter of last year was right before we had the July -- where we started the negative transaction slide. So I would expect, Karen that we'd have about the same margin in the second quarter of 2018...\nAnalysts: [ Sara ].\nExecutives: I'm sorry, [ Sara ]. That we'd have about the same margin in the second quarter of 2018, about 19%, but there's a lot of pushes and pulls. First of all, we're having a net inflection point of about 500 to 600 basis points since the transaction trend last year. We are running positive 3% and then we switched to a negative 3%. So that 500 to 600 basis points, that impacts the margin by negative, about 1.6%. The ongoing labor inflation that we've seen is about 1.2%, 1.3% or so, and that's running about a 5% margin on top of our 26% labor. The menu price increases is helping us by 300 or so basis points, and so the menu price increase essentially offsets the leverage from the comp and then the labor inflation. And then we have pushes in terms of -- this year, we're expecting lower marketing and promo but a little bit higher maintenance and repairs. The maintenance and repairs, we think, is going to be a this-year item, not a forever item but still -- so you've got all these pushes and pulls. And so while our model still has the ability at higher volumes that we can get transaction momentum growing, we can lever the model. We've seen us do that year after year after year. But this negative transaction is taking hits into the margin, and then menu price increase, which adds 300 basis points for the model, is eaten all up by the delever and then by the inflation. And so the important thing for us is to hopefully get some of these things that we're focused on to start transaction momentum, start positive transaction. And then on the menu price, we certainly are open to the idea, instead of waiting 3 years and raising prices to perhaps -- especially that labor inflation is and every year staying at this level, perhaps we take a smaller increase every year, just kind of hold on to our margins in terms of regular ongoing inflation. So I hope that helps in terms of comparing the quarter's year-to-year because it really is a dramatic, different picture since the transaction turned negative.\nOperator: Our next question is with Jason West with Credit Suisse.\nAnalysts: I'm just trying to understand the level of investment that you guys need to make in the stores. You talked about some refresh of equipment and  ambiance, lighting and things like that. But then you also touched on a more significant prototype change with maybe things like mobile ordering, pick-up stations and things like that. So what is the plan there? So I know this year, it feels -- it sounds like more of a refresh plan, but then is it more of a full remodel in the future? Or are you doing both at the same time? Can you talk about that a bit?\nExecutives: Yes, it's actually both at the same time. It's really low hanging fruit to change light bulbs and to freshen with new, deep thirds on the service line, the new stainless steel pans that aren't dent, things like this that really cause customers to notice that there's something different. It's shinier. It's brighter. It's cleaner. And we're going to continue to find those kinds of opportunities. Right now, we have engaged with 3 different architectural firms to create the next version of the Chipotle experience, and we've deliberately asked them to remodel existing restaurants so that this new experience can be applied to existing restaurants as well as brand-new restaurants, and we'll start to see some of those come online shortly. We've got 3 of them now mocked up as models in full-scale cardboard models in a warehouse, and we've walked through them and kicked the tires and really felt what that experience is going to be like. It's really exciting. It combines the traditional Chipotle experience along with things like digital pick-up, whether it's in-store digital or out-of-store digital, and grab and go. And it also allows for potential new menu items, so really exciting stuff and really preparing ourselves for the next 25 years.\nOperator: Our next question is with Karen Holthouse with Goldman Sachs.\nAnalysts: Another question on the side of things. So with this $50 million of spending on -- really, it's maintenance this year. It sounds like you roll off some of that. That more is onetime than ongoing in nature. Would that rolling off give you sort of more flexibility to then increase the -- or reaccelerate unit growth? Or what's sort of the governing factor on maybe getting back to prior peaks of unit growth?\nExecutives: Yes, I think on a theoretical basis, it could [ be that ], but I don't think it's a matter of access to capital because we've got enough access to capital to -- through our operations and through our balance sheet to do the remodels, to do the repairs that Steve talked about. They're bringing our restaurants up to standard. And we can accelerate growth. I think the biggest driver right now is we want to give our ops teams a chance to really get on solid footing. The things that Scott put into place have really just started to take hold. We're going to put a huge emphasis on training, a refocus on training so that we can have confidence that all of our teams, all of our managers, all of our crews will know what our standards are. They can act with these standards, and they'll deliver [indiscernible] experience, including great throughput. We haven't had a great throughput here in the last few years, and that takes a lot of training. So I think the new store growth reaccelerating that is going to be much more about how we feel about the ops teams. And are they on a solid footing, our training programs? Are they really taking hold? And then I think would redeploy capital into the new stores. So I wouldn't say just because capital brings up that, that automatically would move in a new store. And we're not commenting specifically on 2019 right now. I think it'd be prudent for us to get through at least half, if not 3 quarters of, 2018. And then we'll discuss at that time and talk about what 2019 and beyond looks like for growth.\nOperator: Our final question is with Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays.\nAnalysts: Steve, I believe it was last quarter you talked about the next team, whether it was for menu innovation or new segments and whatnot. I know you talked about how queso was like at their first foray. So I'm just wondering with greater time now under your belt, as you think about that kind of next team, what's the early evolution or thoughts around, I think you mentioned, new segments or new day parts? How would you prioritize the different opportunities that perhaps they're coming up with as you think about the next many years? And I know you just mentioned kind of new menu items. So what do you think kind of the genesis of what's the outcome of that next team in terms of over the next year or so?\nExecutives: Sure. I think the next team's biggest opportunity is to always look at our 4 menu and make sure that we're cooking better food. We're sourcing better food. We have better ingredients. We're improving our preparation techniques, our cooking techniques, our serving techniques. It's what drove our business for the first couple of decades, taking a core group of menu items and continually improving them, not only through Food with Integrity but through a better restaurant execution. So that's a priority. But additionally, they need to work on new menu items, and they have a whole host of menu items. The new menu items at a place like Chipotle is tricky though. It's tricky not only because we've had the same menu for basically 25 years but because of the linear format. It's not like you can put a whole new thing up on the menu board and -- like at a typical fast food place. Ingredients sort of become part of the overall offering. So it's a tricky proposition, but it's something that we're working really, really hard on. There are exciting new offerings that are around things like salads and different kinds of grains and also an exploration of traditional things, like -- and these are things that customers are asking for, things like nachos and quesadillas. And so how to integrate those into our service format so that we can maintain throughput and sort of the level of execution that we relied on in the past is tricky. So that's something that they're focusing on also.\nAnalysts: Got it. And then, Jack, I just want to clarify. I think you said more than 1/3 of the tax savings, you're going to reinvest. It sounds like a lot of it is more onetime in nature versus ongoing, but did you say something about the remaining 2/3? I thought you said maybe you'd be reinvesting that as well. Or should we assume that the remainder gets returned to shareholders?\nExecutives: Well, in essence, what we did say is that will help us fund the increase in CapEx, but we'll continue, Jeff. We'll continue to generate more than enough capital to support the -- from operations to support our CapEx. We still have a strong balance sheet. So you can expect us to continue to return cash to shareholder not necessarily in incremental amount. I think the incremental amount that we're getting from taxes is going to be funneled into the extra CapEx and to our existing restaurant. We still have room that we can return some of our capital to shareholders as well through buyback.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call over back to Mark Alexee for closing remarks.\nExecutives: Great. Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to sharing our Q1 results with you, which again is planned for Tuesday, April 24. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.\nOperator: Greetings, and welcome to Chipotle Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mark Alexee, Investor Relations Manager. Please go ahead.\nExecutives: Hello, everyone, and welcome to our call today.

The quiet period will begin on the 16th day of the last month of each fiscal quarter and continues until the next earnings conference call. For the first quarter of 2018, it will begin March 16 and continue through our first quarter earnings release planned for April 24, 2018. \nWe will start today's call with some brief prepared remarks and then open the line for questions. On the call with us today are Steve Ells, our Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jack Hartung, Chief Financial Officer. Scott Boatwright, Chief Restaurant Officer; Mark Crumpacker, our Chief Marketing and Strategy Officer; Curt Garner, Chief Digital and Information Officer; and Laurie Schalow, Chief Communications Officer, are also with us and available during the Q&A period.\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to Steve.\nExecutives: Thanks, Mark, and good afternoon, everyone. In 2018, Chipotle will celebrate its 25th anniversary. This is an ideal time to reflect on the things that have contributed to our success over the past 25 years while at the same time provide an update on the fundamental changes we are making across the business to enable us to get back on a strong growth trajectory and realize our vast potential. \nAs I think back on the past 25 years, I'm extremely proud of the unique company we've created. Our success is based on our passion for serving great-tasting, wholesome food that's served in an interactive environment. It has been our vision and the commitment of doing what is right for our guests, employees, suppliers and farmers, the environment and animals well before these things were common in the world of fast food, all while delivering a superior economic model that has led to our success. When I started Chipotle, I wanted to show that just because food is served fast doesn't mean it has to be a typical fast food experience. It wasn't a commonly held view at the time, but it certainly has paid off. I continue to believe that this approach to serving nutritious, wholesome and delicious food remains highly valued by our guests and can deliver strong returns to our shareholders.\nNow after 25 years, we must navigate new challenges by continuing to evolve how we approach the business. Our results for the quarter clearly show that there is still work to be done to restore strong growth and customer trust. And today, I want to discuss the progress we're making on a number of initiatives that will transform how we manage the company and that will provide a solid foundation for how we build the business going forward. \nToday, I want to talk about 3 key areas of focus: first, our operational changes and efforts to perfect the guest experience; second, enhancing the guest experience through innovations in digital and catering; and third, reinvesting in our existing restaurants to enhance guest convenience and improve the appearance and function of our restaurants. In addition, I'll provide an update on our CEO search. \nFirst, let me discuss the operational changes and efforts to perfect the dining experience. After spending time in our restaurants over the past few months, I've seen firsthand the impact Scott Boatwright and his team are having on our operations. Shifting our operational culture requires leadership, determination and time to retrain and build new habits. Our field leaders are spending time with managers to focus on what it takes to effectively train our teams to deliver an excellent guest experience. Scott and his team have formalized the role of the manager and the role of the field leader to ensure all their efforts are focused on the guest experience. And our support teams are building extensive, detailed trading programs to provide the necessary tools for this type of change. We're also launching a dedicated, centralized training program based in Denver. This program combines classroom teaching, which is new to Chipotle, with live, in-store training in a certified Chipotle restaurant. The curriculum has been tailored to our field leaders to ensure we are effectively addressing the most important elements of delivering a great guest experience. That effort is beginning to pay off as we develop consistency around the speed of service and improving hospitality from every crew member. \nWe're revisiting the concept of throughput, which has historically been an incredible strength of our business. As our training program continues to take hold, our teams will be primed to refocus on delivering excellent throughput in the restaurant again and will be looking at various ways to incentivize terrific throughput. When executed correctly with well-trained crew, throughput is one of the best tools we've had to build sales and to build our brand. \nWe also completed the restructuring of our field leadership, reducing the number of regions and eliminating unnecessary layers above the restaurant. Our field leader ratios have been reduced, enabling our strong field leaders to spend more time in each restaurant. This has had a direct and lasting impact on the restaurant teams. \nAnd over the past 6 months, we've implemented a new guest satisfaction system in our restaurants, and we are encouraged by improvements we've seen across all measures, including key areas of friendliness and ease of ordering. These renewed efforts come in addition to the incentive program changes we instituted at the restaurant level 1 year ago, which makes the guest experience a key component of incentive compensation for our restaurant and field teams. \nWith early signs of an improved guest experience, we are excited to celebrate our 25th anniversary with all of our guests, employees and partners. We will incorporate the 25th anniversary celebration into many of our marketing and promotional campaigns this year, and it will be a rallying point for our brand. We have passionate and loyal fans that love Chipotle, and it's a great opportunity to share their stories along with reminding our guests of all the things that make us unique and special. We'll share more of this campaign with you on our first quarter call.\nNow let me turn to how we are enhancing the guest experience to build sales through innovations in digital and catering. It's clear we must also ensure that we are offering new and convenient ways for our guests to interact with Chipotle. For much of our 25-year history, innovation at Chipotle rightfully focused on sourcing better ingredients, improving our cooking techniques and making our kitchens and equipment more efficient. But over the last year, we've been building new competencies around improving the guest experience through technology and testing new or enhanced offerings. Each of these is designed to improve convenience, add interest to our menu and deliver a better overall experience for our guests. Our digital sales continue to be the fastest-growing part of our business. We hit new records in the fourth quarter as our second make-line sales were up 33% over the prior year. Our digital sales mix was 8.6% of sales, while 2 of our regions have digital sales of more than 10% of their overall mix. We continue to be optimistic as we further market this capability and as guests increasingly order Chipotle through digital platforms. \nThis digital sales growth has been led by mobile ordering, which is up 50% over last year, and the increase has been driven by the new version of our mobile app for Apple and Android. The app's new features include quick reorder of favorite or recent orders and the ability to receive, store and redeem offers. The app also introduces new mobile pay options, a more user-friendly store locator, and a streamlined user experience with enhanced design, and guest response has been consistently positive since the launch. For instance, average monthly users on mobile have more than doubled since the release of the app. \nWe're also seeing higher guest satisfaction in the restaurants that have the new second make-line, and we've seen further reduction in guest wait times to under 15 minutes as we continue to optimize our Smarter Pickup Times. In 2018, we will accelerate the roll-out of our digitally enabled second make-lines. These new lines enable a faster and more accurate experience for our digital customers and allow our crews to more easily support the higher sales volumes. Cumulatively, including new restaurants, we expect to have at least 30% of our restaurants outfitted with these new second make-lines by the end of 2018. We're prioritizing our markets and targeting locations that currently have the highest digital sales volumes to install these new make-lines. \nWe're also testing new catering offerings, which include options for smaller groups, more convenient packaging and new lower-priced options, all of which should help accelerate growth. The test includes catering options for as low as $9 per person and for groups as small as 10 people compared to our current catering, which requires a minimum of 20 people starting at prices of $12 a person. We offer delivery support for catering in about 40% of our restaurants now, and we look forward to expanding this ahead of our peak graduation season. With these initiatives taking hold, our catering sales have grown 20% over the last year. Catering is only a little more than 1% of our sales today with tremendous opportunity for growth in the future. \nWe're also creating new restaurant designs which are optimized for mobile ordering, more ordering options, better beverage presentation and more comfortable dining areas. These new designs have the ability to be applied to our existing restaurants and to any new restaurants that we build. Additionally, we'll reinvest in our existing restaurant base as we launch a significant refresh and maintenance effort to improve the experience. We are replacing dim lighting, upgrading equipment on our service lines and addressing all areas where restaurants have become warm, both inside and outside. We'll continue to expand our digital infrastructure at our restaurants, and we'll also replace aging equipment. Some of these projects are relatively small in scope but with the potential to deliver a significant impact. Jack is going to talk in more detail on the financial impacts of these initiatives.\nChipotle has always been a purpose-driven company. We've had a relentless commitment to doing what's right for our guests and our employees. This year, we will invest more than 1/3 of our anticipated tax savings in our restaurant and support teams through a special bonus and expanded benefits. We will first invest more toward training programs for employees, including the formalized classroom program that we are establishing in Denver. We're also announcing a special bonus program for all employees this year from hourly crew, who will be eligible to earn $250 special bonus; to our restaurant general managers, who will be eligible to earn $1,000 special bonus. And we are expanding our competitive benefits program with paid maternity and paternity leave and expanding our short-term disability and life insurance plans for hourly restaurant managers. All of these enhancements are especially important in today's low unemployment and highly competitive environment, and they come in addition to our average hourly wage that we pay, which is on pace to be more than $12 at the end of 2018. And in addition to our unique slate of benefits that we offer, including discounted college tuition and tuition reimbursement for salaried and hourly employees, twice annual merit increases, paid vacation and paid sick time, and stock awards at the restaurant manager level. \nWe have always been proud of our ability to attract and retain people who share our passion for creating an extraordinary guest experience, and our employees have rallied around our purpose to cultivate nourished communities where wholesome food is enjoyed every day. I want to thank them for their hard work and dedication to making Chipotle an amazing experience. \nChipotle is a very special brand. The past couple of years have presented a set of challenges, but I know that the changes we have made are the right ones to help us move toward achieving our full potential. We will continue to focus on our long-term success, and we'll continue to fight to preserve things that make Chipotle special. An important part of this will be to bring in a proven leader with demonstrated success in meeting the kinds of challenges we currently face. The search for a new CEO is well underway. And as soon as we have found the right person, I'll transition to the role of Executive Chairman. The board and I are committed to bringing in a world-class leader with demonstrated expertise to improve execution, build guest trust and drive sales. We do not have an update on timing today, but we'll share news of our decision as soon as the process is complete. We firmly believe that a new CEO with a passion for driving excellence across every aspect of our business will be another important step in our growth, and I'm optimistic as we look forward to the next 25 years.\nI'll now turn the call over to Jack.\nExecutives: Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. Last year held its full share of challenges, but we began 2018 with optimism that the changes made so far and the changes and investments we will make in 2018 will establish the foundation for a strong future. Our restaurant teams and field support teams are more committed than ever to delivering an excellent guest experience, and we'll continue to emphasize the guest as we significantly increase our focus and investment on training. We've established incentives for our managers and field leaders to continue to elevate the guest experience and to build sales. Our second make-line sales, including online, mobile and catering, are the fastest-growing parts of the business, and we expect that growth to continue or even accelerate. We also plan to invest much more in our existing restaurants during 2018 and beyond to create a better dining environment but ultimately to improve the overall experience and flow of our restaurants. \nI'll begin by reviewing results for the fourth quarter and full year and then provide details related to our capital reinvestment plans and tax savings from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. \nFor the fourth quarter, we reported $1.1 billion in sales on comp sales growth of 0.9%. Our reported comps include a 60 basis point decrease as we lapped Chiptopia deferred revenue in Q4 of last year. If you recall, we recognized an additional 60 basis point benefit in sales comp related to the deferred revenue in Q4 2016, and now that reduces our comp in the current period. We'll have a similar decrease in the first quarter of 2018 of about 50 basis points to our comp. Our restaurant level margins were 14.9% in the quarter, and we generated $1.55 in earnings per diluted share. Our EPS in the quarter benefited by about $0.21 related to the recent U.S. tax law changes. \nFor the full year, we reported $4.5 billion of sales on a sales comp increase of 6.4%, which includes a 30 basis point benefit related to Chiptopia. Restaurant-level margins were 16.9%, and we generated diluted earnings per share of $6.17. The Q4 underlying comp of 1.5% before the 60 basis point effect of Chiptopia was driven by a higher average check as we expanded our menu price increase to an additional 900 restaurants in November, bringing the total menu price impact during the quarter to about 240 basis points. Average check also benefited by about 200 basis points from queso, and queso continued to add about 200 basis points to the average check in January as guests are currently adding queso in a little more than 10% of our transactions. Pay traffic in the quarter was down about 3% due to the negative transaction trends that began in July of last year. \nJanuary 2018 sales comp was 3.4%. We had one extra trading day in the month as we opened on New Year's Day for the first time, and that day contributed about 240 basis points and will account for just under 1% in the comp for the first quarter. Sales were adversely impacted during the first 3 weeks of January from the series of winter storms that impacted most of the country. As the weather has normalized over the past 2 weeks, our comps have been running in the 2.5% to the 3.5% range. \nFirst quarter comparisons will get tougher as we enter mid-February and March as warm weather last year caused our comps to surge, essentially bringing our normal seasonal spring sales bump earlier than normal. If our recent sales dollar trends continue through the first quarter, we would expect a comp of between 1% and 2% before the impact of Chiptopia. \nOur full year comp guidance for 2018 is in the low single digits, with lower sales comps expected in the first half of the year due to the tougher comparisons and then improving in the second half as comparisons ease. In addition to the menu price increase last November, we completed the final round of price increases in January in about 1,000 remaining restaurants or about 40% of our restaurants. The average price increase in these markets was about 5%, and we expect resistance of around 20% or less. We expect the average check will continue to benefit by -- benefit the comp by about 2% from guests adding queso through the first 8 months of 2018 until we lap the queso roll-out in September.  Of course, all this means we will likely continue to see negative transactions until we lap the beginning of the negative transaction trend, which began in July. \nFood costs during the quarter were 34.2%, down from 35.3% in the prior year and down from 35% in Q3. The decrease from last year was driven by menu price increases, better management of paper and packaging inventories and lower priced avocados. We expect relatively stable prices in 2018, including for avocados, which along with the price increase should lower our food cost to the low to mid-33% range. California avocado growth should be on the upswing for their alternate bearing crop this summer, and we are fortunate that the recent wildfires in California are not expected to impact supply. \nLabor costs in the fourth quarter were 27.5%, flat with the prior year. Higher wage inflation of 5% was offset by a combination of factors, including labor efficiencies due to fewer promotions, lower insurance and benefit costs and slight leverage from pricing. Since early 2014, true wages and benefits have increased by a cumulative 29% but we have only increased pricing by a cumulative 12%. Our restaurant managers and crews are running some of the most efficient restaurant labor deployment we have seen in years. The labor pressures will continue at this level because of wage inflation, softer transaction trends and as we add our enhanced benefits that Steve discussed. Our labor as a percent of sales are typically flat from Q4 into Q1, although we anticipate it to increase slightly in Q1 related to regulatory minimum wage increases as of January 1, combined with the reinvestment into our employees funded by the tax savings. \nOccupancy costs for the fourth quarter were 7.6% of sales versus 7.4% last year. The higher occupancy costs are driven by inflation from renewals and slightly higher average rents from new restaurants. We anticipate new restaurant openings in 2018 to continue to have modestly higher average rents than existing restaurants due to refocusing our development pipeline with a heavier weighting toward proven markets. As a percentage of sales, occupancy for the full year should be about in line with 2017 in the low to mid-7% range as a percent of sales. \nOther operating costs were 15.8% of sales in the quarter, a decrease from 16.3% last year. Our marketing and promo costs were 3.8% of sales in the quarter, which is a decrease of about 100 basis points compared to last year. Our other operating costs also included 50 basis points of incremental costs related to maintenance and repairs. Maintenance and repairs is expected to remain at elevated levels during 2018, which I'll explain more fully in a few minutes.\nIn 2018, we anticipate marketing and promo activity will be at or slightly above 3% of sales. Marketing and promo costs will be slightly higher in the second and third quarters, with lower spending in Q1 and Q4. For the full year, we anticipate other operating costs to be about the same as last year as savings from the lower marketing and promo will be reinvested into existing restaurants with higher maintenance and repairs. With normal lower seasonal sales in the first quarter and the increased reinvestment in our restaurants, we would anticipate Q1 other operating expenses to be right around 15% of sales. \nSo overall, in Q1, the restaurant level margins are typically similar to fourth quarter with lower expected food and other operating costs and the full benefit of the price increase offset by higher maintenance and repairs investment and the investment in the special bonus for employees, Q1 margin should be in the 16% to 16.5% range. \nG&A costs for the full year 2017 were 6.6% of sales or a total of $296 million, and this includes $30 million related to the data security incident from April 2017, $60 million in stock compensation and $8 million in our employee bonus program. During 2017, our employee bonus program underperformed our targets. For the full year 2018, we anticipate G&A costs will be about $330 million, and this includes around $66 million for stock comp, $18 million for employee bonus program as we expect to return to paying bonuses at our target during 2018, $12 million for one-time executive retention bonuses and stock grants and $12 million for our biennial All Manager Conference. We expect underlying recurring G&A to grow by about $25 million after 3 years of flat G&A despite the fact that we opened more than 650 restaurants during this time. The $25 million includes the formalized new training programs and the one-time special bonuses for staff related to the savings from tax rate reduction. \nWe plan to invest a total of about $300 million in capital expenses in 2018, an increase from our 2017 investment of $217 million. For the first time ever, our capital investment into existing restaurants will outpace our investment in new restaurant openings. The total CapEx will be funded from our cash flow from operations and include several components: First, in addition to normal ongoing upkeep of a restaurant for which we would typically invest around $10,000 per restaurant or around $24 million, we'll invest another $50 million to fund a new refresh and maintenance program that Steve introduced. This $50 million is a discrete, one-time investment that will average about $20,000 per restaurant, and it will allow us to fully assess the interiors of every single restaurant, improve efficiencies, ensure that the environments are warm and welcoming for our guests. This focus on improving our restaurants is also driving higher maintenance and repair expenses, which we expect will continue throughout 2018. In early tests, we have seen modest investments can have a significant influence on the atmosphere for our guests. \nIn addition, we'll invest into new growth initiatives, including about $45 million to continue to retrofit our digitally enhanced second make-lines into existing restaurants. Including new restaurants, the digitally enhanced second make-line will be in about 1,000 restaurants by the end of the year. We'll also invest about $15 million to improve IT infrastructure, a portion of which will support and enhance our digital programs and digital experience. Our digital investments are targeted toward the fastest-growing piece of our business and will be accompanied by other digital experience enhancements and focused marketing efforts that continue to encourage digital ordering. \nBeyond digital, we'll invest about $10 million in designing new prototype restaurants. The results from these prototypes will inform both new restaurant design and remodels of our older restaurants in 2019 and in 2020. We also plan to invest around $25 million into initiatives around optimizing our energy uses in our restaurants and introduce better equipment to cook our food, such as a new rice cooker to make our restaurants more efficient. \nAnd while we're investing more aggressively into our existing restaurants, our development pipeline remains healthy and we expect to build and open around 130 to 150 new restaurants during 2018. The majority of new restaurants will continue to be built in our proven markets where we've had a loyal and growing customer base. New restaurants opened during 2017 performed at about 75% of our average sales volumes and continue to provide a strong return during the first year of operations. Our net cost to build these restaurants will be slightly higher in 2018 as every site now incorporates the new digitally enabled second make-line. \nAnd finally, we'll invest about $25 million into other general corporate initiatives, which includes the consolidation of our 2 separate offices in Denver so that we can create a more efficient and more collaborative environment. \nEffective tax rate for the full year 2017 was 36.1% compared with 40.8% in 2016. And for the quarter, our tax rate was 28.8%. This lower quarterly tax rate resulted from remeasuring our deferred tax liability at the 21% corporate federal tax rate following the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act becoming law in late December. The full year rate is lower than 2016 due to the tax rate changes along with lower state tax rates. \nWe expect the 2018 effective full year tax rate to be between 30% and 31%, with an underlying effective tax rate to be in the 27% to 28% range. There are a few moving pieces in this new rate. Relative to our normalized tax rate of about 39% the last few years our federal tax rate will decrease by 1,400 basis points as a result of the federal tax rate changes. But offsetting this decrease, our state taxes will be higher by about 100 to 200 basis points due to the reduced benefit of deducting state taxes at the new lower federal tax rate. And under the new federal tax law, we can no longer expense the full cost of our employee meals for tax purposes, which is a substantial benefit that we offer our employees. That adds another 100 basis points to our tax rate. \nThis underlying effective tax rate of 27% to 28% will then be impacted by prior and future stock-based compensation plans. We currently have deferred tax assets related to outstanding nonvested stock awards that contain market and performance conditions. If market conditions are not achieved, than we may not realize the benefit of this deferred tax asset, which will result in a higher effective tax rate at future periods. For current outstanding awards, such as the 2015 and 2016 performance stock grant, there are estimates that these awards either may not vest or may vest at lower realized values than originally anticipated. Under either scenario, we would not benefit from the initial deferred tax asset, which would negatively impact our effective tax rate by around 300 to 400 basis points. \nOverall, corporate tax law changes will result in tax savings of around $40 million to $50 million in 2018. We plan to invest more than 1/3 of these savings in our people with investments in special bonuses to our crew, managers and support staff, investment in employee training and enhanced employee benefits. The remainder of the tax savings will help fund our investment to enhance existing restaurants. \nWe continue to maintain a strong balance sheet, and we finished the year with $509 million in cash and investments and generated $467 million in cash from operations during 2017. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased $77 million of our stock at an average price of $297 per share, and we repurchased $284 million in stock during the full year 2017. Even with our increased investment in existing restaurants in 2018, we still expect to do opportunistically repurchase shares throughout the year albeit at a lower level than last year. As should be expected, our outlook for 2018 does not include any potential strategic changes that may be driven by a new CEO.\nDespite a challenging year, we feel that we have a lot of momentum and energy throughout the company heading into 2018. We're more committed than ever to continue to perfect our dining experience and to build our sales. The investments that we're making in our people and to growing our digital and catering business and investing in new innovation will not only help set up the foundation for a successful 2018 but also for the next 25 years. \nThank you, and we'll now open the lines for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is with John Glass from Morgan Stanley.\nAnalysts: First, just on top line drivers, if you could comment about, in 2018, how you're viewing either product development differently or approaching marketing differently. Does queso give you more confidence, for example, in more new product introductions in 2018 that drive traffic? When you think about marketing, the same question, your approach has been nontraditional in the past. Does that approach continue to work? Or do you think that this is the time to pivot to maybe more traditional marketing message to get traffic going again?\nExecutives: Thanks, John. So we've learned a lot over the last year as we pivoted toward more traditional marketing using television, in particular. So this year, we're going to do a number of things. Our marketing plan will consist -- traditionally has 3 big components over the year, big -- 3 big advertising components. So in the spring, we will launch another advertising campaign. This time though, it will be using addressable TV rather than broadcast TV, which was a learning that we took away from fall, where a lot of that TV were reaching lapsed customers who aren't the best target for us. So we're really focusing in more with this addressable TV on the new and current customers that we have. And then in the summer, we'll head into our 25th anniversary marketing campaign, which is largely targeted toward existing customers, although certainly, it will reach new as well. And then in the fall, there will be another large advertising campaign, which again is likely to include television. What I -- so the pivot, I think, toward more traditional advertising will continue, the one that we started last year. That's not to say that we won't do more nontraditional things as we always have. The notable difference, I think, for this year will be in the addition of a much more robust CRM platform and the inclusion of a loyalty program, which we should see in the second half of the year. So that will give us -- the combination of this more strategic approach to advertising, particularly the use of this addressable TV, along with a more robust CRM platform should allow us to reach the right customers more effectively. So there's -- so I think it is overall a pivot to slightly more traditional, if you will, advertising, but we're doing it in a very targeted way.\nAnalysts: Jack, if I could just sneak in one follow-up. You gave a number of detailed items around cost items individually. Could you just -- if you're going to hit -- if you were to hit your low single-digit comp guidance for the year in 2018, where do you think store margins land on the basis of what you just described?\nExecutives: Yes, John, I think we'll be in the -- probably in the upper teens, maybe in the 17.5% to 18%, 18.5% range, something like that. A couple of percent margin means that we would delever on the labor line, with labor inflation running in the mid-single digits and with -- only running a 2%. Even though that's driven by price, that means we're still running negative transactions. And so I think it would be in that -- probably constrained in that 17.5% to 18%, maybe as high as 18.5%, if we really get cooperation from commodities. We've also got some of the onetime things I mentioned as well, like the bonus that we're going to pay for tax savings and then the additional M&R, maintenance and repair, that we're going to in addition to extra capital. We're really going to place a heavy focus on making sure our restaurants look, feel and are a wonderful environment for our customers. I think that's about where you can expect margins to hit for the year, John.\nOperator: Our next question is with Nicole Miller from Piper Jaffray.\nAnalysts: I just had 2 quick questions. The first one, on point number two on innovations around digital and catering, how does loyalty fit into the mix there? And when might you be willing to launch a loyalty program?\nExecutives: Well, as I just said, we expect to launch a loyalty program, which is part of a larger CRM effort, in the second half of the year. So the program is being designed as we speak. And so loyalty is a subset of a larger CRM effort, which will be an important part of all of our digital marketing as well as catering -- as marketing, catering, obviously, as those are things that we market to people who we know as existing customers. So they're very much linked.\nAnalysts: And will you be -- you'll get the customer data so that you can reach out to them and this is a surprise and delight or a point dollar-based program?\nExecutives: Well, yes, I mean, absolutely. I mean, the -- Knowing the customer and having a one-to-one relationship with them is the central focus of it. The actual structure of the program is not something that we're talking about today, but absolutely, everything is on the table with regard to that.\nAnalysts: Okay. And then just a second question with regards to the 130 and 150 new stores, so how to model those. Any sequence you would offer quarterly? And then are these new stores in new markets? Are they in existing markets? And is there any international growth to speak of?\nExecutives: Yes, Nicole. They should be reasonably even fill throughout the year. Time lines always change throughout the year, but there's nothing out of the ordinary in terms of the way that they fall into the quarters. And most of them will be in proven markets. We still will see the few here and there in some of the newer markets, but most of them way over -- way more than 80% should be in our proven and established market, which gives us greater confidence that they should open and generate an attractive return right out of the box.\nExecutives: And none planned in international.\nExecutives: And nothing planned in international right now, Nicole.\nOperator: Our next question is with David Tarantino with Robert Baird.\nAnalysts: A couple of questions on the traffic trends. First, Jack, on the quarter-to-date commentary, I think you sort of pointed to an underlying trend of around 2.5% to 3.5%. Can you just confirm the level of pricing that you have in that equation so that we can get to kind of an underlying traffic number? I believe you might be running 5% pricing or higher, plus the queso.\nExecutives: Yes, it's right at 5%, David. There were some markets that had extremely high local cost, especially labor. So market by market, you would see some markets that were a little above 5%, but the overall weighted average across the country is running about 5%. We typically model in about a 20% resistance so that 5% converts to about 4%. We might see less resistance than that but -- so I would expect the comp to benefit somewhere between 4% and 5%. And then we're running 2% added to the check because of queso. So when we're running a 3%, for example, 3% positive comp, if you assume 4% from pricing and a couple of percent from queso, you could back into a negative transaction of somewhere in the 3% range.\nAnalysts: Got it. And then your guidance for the year seems to assume that doesn't get an awful lot better despite everything you're doing. Is that correct? If you look at sort of the seasonally adjusted traffic trends, are you assuming much improvement? Or are you just assuming that the year-over-year number gets better when you cycle the step-down you saw in the second half of the year?\nExecutives: Well, there's a couple of things, David. One, we do assume the back half of the year, the underlying trends do get better because comparisons get better when we compare against July. We're comparing against the beginning of the negative transaction. So we do think the transactions get better. But we have a couple of things also that roll off. We have some pricing that rolls off in April. We will compare against queso launch in September, and we'll compare against the pricing in November as well. Of course, we hope that we will build even more momentum. So we're not being overly bullish with our guidance. We're working on a number of things from an ops standpoint. From a digital standpoint, Mark mentioned loyalty. So we're hoping that we can spark a more positive transaction trend, but based on how tough it's been the last couple of years, to get that momentum going, we think this is the right level of guidance.\nAnalysts: Makes sense. And then one more if Scott Boatwright is available to answer. There's a comment about guest satisfaction scores and the new system that you're using to measure those and some early signs being good on your progress there. So I was just wondering if Scott could comment on sort of where you think you are today on those metrics and where you think you need to be to drive much better traffic trends.\nExecutives: David, Scott here. We are using Medallia as our partner in this space, and we have just really started garnering the level of survey volume necessary for statistical relevance probably over the course of the last 4 to 5 months. And we have seen pretty significant growth in overall satisfaction since September of last year with a steady increase and still -- and February still ahead of January although not fully baked but feel really good about our current trends. I feel like we are really regaining consumer confidence all across the country by some of the steps that we took later in last year to really shore up some of our operational deficiencies, and we'll see that to continue to improve. I am encouraged by the trend at this point. But to the last part of your question, I think to be best in class, we probably need to continue to improve probably another 600, 700 basis points from where we sit today.\nOperator: Our next question is with Sharon Zackfia with William Blair.\nAnalysts: A few questions. I just want to clarify, Jack, on that 1% to 2% comp for the first quarter, are you including the New Year's Day benefit in that?\nExecutives: I am, Sharon, yes. The New Year's Day overall for the quarter will give us about 1%. So that does imply that we're looking about just on top of that a 1%, positive net 1% to 2% range. And the reason is just that our sales really surged significantly in the middle of February, and we're about to go up against those numbers. So if we're lucky, we'll get mild weather again, but again, if we have kind of normal winter weather compared to how warm it was last year. 1% to 2% is about where we expect the quarter to fall.\nAnalysts: Okay. And then I guess a question on the CEO search. I think, Steve, you mentioned being a purpose-driven company, and clearly, the culture has been one of the key hallmarks over time of Chipotle. As you look for that new CEO, is that -- purpose-driven dynamic, is that a guardrail on that search? Or would somebody come in and kind of have free rein to take Chipotle in the direction he or she thinks it should go?\nExecutives: Sure, Sharon. It's a delicate balance bringing in a new CEO. Of course, you've heard of examples where new CEOs have come in but have not really been allowed to act as a CEO, and I fully intend to have the new CEO be in charge. It's been great spending time with a number of candidates. And one thing has been consistent though and that is how strongly Chipotle has impressed these folks and it's based in the purpose. So many of the candidates come from the restaurant industry and have been -- either have led them or been a key player in these brands. And while they've enjoyed a lot of success in their companies, they've never had the kind of purpose that we've had at Chipotle, which is, I think, very, very exciting to all of them. I think it's not lost on them that you can really have both. You can have a purpose and you can have a product that's very, very popular with consumers, and you can have a great economic model. And for 25 years, we never compromised on that. We had it all. And we need to get back on track and build momentum again, and all of the new CEOs realize that. I don't think you're going to see a situation where someone says, \"To hell with Food with Integrity. We're going to buy cheap commodity meat now and really turn this thing around.\" I just don't -- I don't worry that, that kind of a thing would happen.\nOperator: Our next question is with [ Sara Centrum ] with [ AB ].\nAnalysts: One question and one follow-up, please. So the question is on the CapEx and some of the investment in the existing stores. I think the comment was that you're seeing some real benefits in terms of customer experience, but is that translating into same-store sales lift? I think a lot of times in the industry, we see lifts in the kind of mid-single-digit range when you -- when there are some upgrades to store. So just trying to get a sense of that guest experience improvement that you're seeing is actually also translating into top line. And then I do have a question on margins.\nExecutives: [ Sara ], this is Scott Boatwright. It's a fantastic question. Once I joined the brand back last summer, I spent a great deal of time in our restaurants really from coast to coast and recognized there was a great deal of deferred maintenance across the country that needed to be addressed to ensure that we are best on block in each of the trade areas in which we operate. Unfortunately, [ Sara ], those changes don't really alter the facade or the exterior of the Chipotle restaurants that I'm talking about. So it wouldn't garner additional traffic, but I do feel like as a great number of our guests dine in that changing the experience for those folks will -- although a slow build, will contribute to the overall sales performance here in 2018.\nAnalysts: Great. And then just on the margins, Jack, if you could talk a little bit about -- I think, a year ago or what have you, we talked about 20% restaurant margins at $2 million AUVs, and that sounds like maybe you're looking for 18% restaurant margins that -- roughly that number, even little bit higher, granted that you're reinvesting some of the tax savings as is the rest of the industry. But I guess is that 20% number off the table? And a related question, do you rethink how you approach pricing given that the nature of your pricing has meant that you've really lagged the cost inflation by quite a bit?\nExecutives: Yes. It's a good question, and let me try to answer it this way. Let me go back to Q2 of last year when our margin was at -- right around 19%, 18.9% or 19%, and then let's talk about what we can expect in the second quarter of this year, and that might be the best kind of way to show kind of before and after because second quarter of last year was right before we had the July -- where we started the negative transaction slide. So I would expect, Karen that we'd have about the same margin in the second quarter of 2018...\nAnalysts: [ Sara ].\nExecutives: I'm sorry, [ Sara ]. That we'd have about the same margin in the second quarter of 2018, about 19%, but there's a lot of pushes and pulls. First of all, we're having a net inflection point of about 500 to 600 basis points since the transaction trend last year. We are running positive 3% and then we switched to a negative 3%. So that 500 to 600 basis points, that impacts the margin by negative, about 1.6%. The ongoing labor inflation that we've seen is about 1.2%, 1.3% or so, and that's running about a 5% margin on top of our 26% labor. The menu price increases is helping us by 300 or so basis points, and so the menu price increase essentially offsets the leverage from the comp and then the labor inflation. And then we have pushes in terms of -- this year, we're expecting lower marketing and promo but a little bit higher maintenance and repairs. The maintenance and repairs, we think, is going to be a this-year item, not a forever item but still -- so you've got all these pushes and pulls. And so while our model still has the ability at higher volumes as we can get transaction momentum growing, we can lever the model. We've seen us do that year after year after year. But this negative transaction hit is taking hits into the margin, and then menu price increase, which adds 300 basis points for the model, is eaten all up by the delever and then by the inflation. And so the important thing for us is to hopefully get some of these things that we're focused on to start transaction momentum, start positive transaction. And then on the menu price, we certainly are open to the idea, instead of waiting 3 years and raising prices to perhaps -- especially if the labor inflation is an every year thing at this level, perhaps we take a smaller increase every year, just kind of hold on to our margins in terms of regular ongoing inflation. So I hope that helps in terms of comparing the quarter's year-to-year because it really is a dramatic, different picture since the transaction turned negative.\nOperator: Our next question is with Jason West with Credit Suisse.\nAnalysts: I'm just trying to understand the level of investment that you guys need to make in the stores. You talked about some refresh of equipment and ambiance, lighting and things like that. But then you also touched on a more significant prototype change with maybe things like mobile ordering, pick-up stations and things like that. So what is the plan there? So I know this year, it feels -- it sounds like more of a refresh plan, but then is it more of a full remodel in the future? Or are you doing both at the same time? Can you talk about that a bit?\nExecutives: Yes, it's actually both at the same time. It's really low hanging fruit to change light bulbs and to freshen with new, deep thirds on the service line, the new stainless steel pans that aren't bent, things like this that really cause customers to notice that there's something different. It's shinier. It's brighter. It's cleaner. And we're going to continue to find those kinds of opportunities. Right now, we have engaged with 3 different architectural firms to create the next version of the Chipotle experience, and we've deliberately asked them to remodel existing restaurants so that this new experience can be applied to existing restaurants as well as brand-new restaurants, and we'll start to see some of those come online shortly. We've got 3 of them now mocked up as models in full-scale cardboard models in a warehouse, and we've walked through them and kicked the tires and really felt what that experience is going to be like. It's really exciting. It combines the traditional Chipotle experience along with things like digital pick-up, whether it's in-store digital or out-of-store digital, and grab and go. And it also allows for potential new menu items, so really exciting stuff and really preparing ourselves for the next 25 years.\nOperator: Our next question is with Karen Holthouse with Goldman Sachs.\nAnalysts: Another question on the side of things. So with this $50 million of spending on -- really, it's maintenance this year. It sounds like you roll off some of that. That more is onetime than ongoing in nature. Would that rolling off give you sort of more flexibility to then increase the -- or reaccelerate unit growth? Or what's sort of the governing factor on maybe getting back to prior peaks of unit growth?\nExecutives: Yes, I think on a theoretical basis, it could lead to that, but I don't think it's a matter of access to capital because we've got enough access to capital to -- through our operations and through our balance sheet to do the remodels, to do the repairs that Steve talked about. They're bringing our restaurants up to standard. And we can accelerate growth. I think the biggest driver right now is we want to give our ops teams a chance to really get on solid footing. The things that Scott put into place have really just started to take hold. We're going to put a huge emphasis on training, a refocus on training so that we can have confidence that all of our teams, all of our managers, all of our crews will know what our standards are. They can execute these standards, and they'll deliver an excellent guest experience, including great throughput. We haven't had a great throughput year in the last few years, and that takes a lot of training. So I think the new store growth reaccelerating that is going to be much more about how we feel about the ops teams. And are they on a solid footing, our training programs? Are they really taking hold? And then I think would redeploy capital into the new stores. So I wouldn't say just because capital brings up that, that automatically would move in a new store. And we're not commenting specifically on 2019 right now. I think it'd be prudent for us to get through at least half, if not 3 quarters of, 2018. And then we'll assess at that time and talk about what 2019 and beyond looks like for growth.\nOperator: Our final question is with Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays.\nAnalysts: Steve, I believe it was last quarter you talked about the next team, whether it was for menu innovation or new segments and whatnot. I know you talked about how queso was like at their first foray. So I'm just wondering with greater time now under your belt, as you think about that kind of next team, what's the early evolution or thoughts around, I think you mentioned, new segments or new day parts? How would you prioritize the different opportunities that perhaps they're coming up with as you think about the next many years? And I know you just mentioned kind of new menu items. So what do you think kind of the genesis of what's the outcome of that next team in terms of over the next year or so?\nExecutives: Sure. I think the next team's biggest opportunity is to always look at our core menu and make sure that we're cooking better food. We're sourcing better food. We have better ingredients. We're improving our preparation techniques, our cooking techniques, our serving techniques. It's what drove our business for the first couple of decades, taking a core group of menu items and continually improving them, not only through Food with Integrity but through a better restaurant execution. So that's a priority. But additionally, they need to work on new menu items, and they have a whole host of menu items. The new menu items at a place like Chipotle is tricky though. It's tricky not only because we've had the same menu for basically 25 years but because of the linear format. It's not like you can put a whole new thing up on the menu board and -- like at a typical fast food place. Ingredients sort of become part of the overall offering. So it's a tricky proposition, but it's something that we're working really, really hard on. There are exciting new offerings that are around things like salads and different kinds of grains and also an exploration of traditional things, like -- and these are things that customers are asking for, things like nachos and quesadillas. And so how to integrate those into our service format so that we can maintain throughput and sort of the level of execution that we relied on in the past is tricky. So that's something that they're focusing on also.\nAnalysts: Got it. And then, Jack, I just want to clarify. I think you said more than 1/3 of the tax savings, you're going to reinvest. It sounds like a lot of it is more onetime in nature versus ongoing, but did you say something about the remaining 2/3? I thought you said maybe you'd be reinvesting that as well. Or should we assume that the remainder gets returned to shareholders?\nExecutives: Well, in essence, what we did say is that will help us fund the increase in CapEx, but we'll continue, Jeff. We'll continue to generate more than enough capital to support the -- from operations to support our CapEx. We still have a strong balance sheet. So you can expect us to continue to return cash to shareholder not necessarily in incremental amount. I think the incremental amount that we're getting from taxes is going to be funneled into the extra CapEx and to our existing restaurant. We still have room that we can return some of our capital to shareholders as well through buyback.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call over back to Mark Alexee for closing remarks.\nExecutives: Great. Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to sharing our Q1 results with you, which again is planned for Tuesday, April 24. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, thank you for your participation.\nOperator: Greetings, and welcome to Chipotle Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mark Alexee, Investor Relations Manager. Please go ahead.\nExecutives: Hello, everyone, and welcome to our call today. By now you should have access to our earnings announcement released this afternoon for the fourth quarter and full year 2017. It may also be found on our website at chipotle.com in the Investor Relations section. \nBefore we begin our presentation, I will remind everyone that parts of our discussion today will include forward-looking statements as defined in the securities laws. These forward-looking statements will include statements regarding our CEO search; initiatives to build sales; investments in restaurant upgrades; expected tax savings from tax law changes; sales trends and forecasts for future comparable restaurant sales, transactions and the impact of menu price increases; expected new restaurant openings; estimates of future food, labor, occupancy, marketing, other operating and general and administrative cost trends and expected margins; statements about plans for capital expenditures, returns on investment and stock repurchases as well as other statements of our expectations and plans.

The quiet period will begin on the 16th day of the last month of each fiscal quarter and continues until the next earnings conference call. For the first quarter of 2018, it will begin March 16 and continue through our first quarter earnings release planned for April 24, 2018. \nWe will start today's call with some brief prepared remarks and then open the line for questions. On the call with us today are Steve Ells, our Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jack Hartung, Chief Financial Officer. Scott Boatwright, Chief Restaurant Officer; Mark Crumpacker, our Chief Marketing and Strategy Officer; Curt Garner, Chief Digital and Information Officer; and Laurie Schalow, Chief Communications Officer, are also with us and available during the Q&A period.\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to Steve.\nExecutives: Thanks, Mark, and good afternoon, everyone. In 2018, Chipotle will celebrate its 25th anniversary. This is an ideal time to reflect on the things that have contributed to our success over the past 25 years while at the same time provide an update on the fundamental changes we are making across the business to enable us to get back on a strong growth trajectory and realize our vast potential. \nAs I think back on the past 25 years, I'm extremely proud of the unique company we've created. Our success is based on our passion for serving great-tasting, wholesome food that's served in an interactive environment. It has been our vision and the commitment of doing what is right for our guests, employees, suppliers and farmers, the environment and animals well before these things were common in the world of fast food, all while delivering a superior economic model that has led to our success. When I started Chipotle, I wanted to show that just because food is served fast doesn't mean it has to be a typical fast food experience. It wasn't a commonly held view at the time, but it certainly has paid off. I continue to believe that this approach to serving nutritious, wholesome and delicious food remains highly valued by our guests and can deliver strong returns to our shareholders.\nNow after 25 years, we must navigate new challenges by continuing to evolve how we approach the business. Our results for the quarter clearly show that there is still work to be done to restore strong growth and customer trust. And today, I want to discuss the progress we're making on a number of initiatives that will transform how we manage the company and that will provide a solid foundation for how we build the business going forward. \nToday, I want to talk about 3 key areas of focus: first, our operational changes and efforts to perfect the guest experience; second, enhancing the guest experience through innovations in digital and catering; and third, reinvesting in our existing restaurants to enhance guest convenience and improve the appearance and function of our restaurants. In addition, I'll provide an update on our CEO search. \nFirst, let me discuss the operational changes and efforts to perfect the dining experience. After spending time in our restaurants over the past few months, I've seen firsthand the impact Scott Boatwright and his team are having on our operations. Shifting our operational culture requires leadership, determination and time to retrain and build new habits. Our field leaders are spending time with managers to focus on what it takes to effectively train our teams to deliver an excellent guest experience. Scott and his team have formalized the role of the manager and the role of the field leader to ensure all their efforts are focused on the guest experience. And our support teams are building extensive, detailed trading programs to provide the necessary tools for this type of change. We're also launching a dedicated, centralized training program based in Denver. This program combines classroom teaching, which is new to Chipotle, with live, in-store training in a certified Chipotle restaurant. The curriculum has been tailored to our field leaders to ensure we are effectively addressing the most important elements of delivering a great guest experience. That effort is beginning to pay off as we develop consistency around the speed of service and improving hospitality from every crew member. \nWe're revisiting the concept of throughput, which has historically been an incredible strength of our business. As our training program continues to take hold, our teams will be primed to refocus on delivering excellent throughput in the restaurant again and will be looking at various ways to incentivize terrific throughput. When executed correctly with well-trained crew, throughput is one of the best tools we've had to build sales and to build our brand. \nWe also completed the restructuring of our field leadership, reducing the number of regions and eliminating unnecessary layers above the restaurant. Our field leader ratios have been reduced, enabling our strong field leaders to spend more time in each restaurant. This has had a direct and lasting impact on the restaurant teams. \nAnd over the past 6 months, we've implemented a new guest satisfaction system in our restaurants, and we are encouraged by improvements we've seen across all measures, including key areas of friendliness and ease of ordering. These renewed efforts come in addition to the incentive program changes we instituted at the restaurant level 1 year ago, which makes the guest experience a key component of incentive compensation for our restaurant and field teams. \nWith early signs of an improved guest experience, we are excited to celebrate our 25th anniversary with all of our guests, employees and partners. We will incorporate the 25th anniversary celebration into many of our marketing and promotional campaigns this year, and it will be a rallying point for our brand. We have passionate and loyal fans that love Chipotle, and it's a great opportunity to share their stories along with reminding our guests of all the things that make us unique and special. We'll share more of this campaign with you on our first quarter call.\nNow let me turn to how we are enhancing the guest experience to build sales through innovations in digital and catering. It's clear we must also ensure that we are offering new and convenient ways for our guests to interact with Chipotle. For much of our 25-year history, innovation at Chipotle rightfully focused on sourcing better ingredients, improving our cooking techniques and making our kitchens and equipment more efficient. But over the last year, we've been building new competencies around improving the guest experience through technology and testing new or enhanced offerings. Each of these is designed to improve convenience, add interest to our menu and deliver a better overall experience for our guests. Our digital sales continue to be the fastest-growing part of our business. We hit new records in the fourth quarter as our second make-line sales were up 33% over the prior year. Our digital sales mix was 8.6% of sales, while 2 of our regions have digital sales of more than 10% of their overall mix. We continue to be optimistic as we further market this capability and as guests increasingly order Chipotle through digital platforms. \nThis digital sales growth has been led by mobile ordering, which is up 50% over last year, and the increase has been driven by the new version of our mobile app for Apple and Android. The app's new features include quick reorder of favorite or recent orders and the ability to receive, store and redeem offers. The app also introduces new mobile pay options, a more user-friendly store locator and a streamlined user experience with enhanced design and guest response has been consistently positive since the launch. For instance, average monthly users on mobile have more than doubled since the release of the app. \nWe're also seeing higher guest satisfaction in the restaurants that have the new second make-line, and we've seen further reduction in guest wait times to under 15 minutes as we continue to optimize our Smarter Pickup Times. In 2018, we will accelerate the roll-out of our digitally enabled second make-lines. These new lines enable a faster and more accurate experience for our digital customers and allow our crews to more easily support the higher sales volumes. Cumulatively, including new restaurants, we expect to have at least 30% of our restaurants outfitted with these new second make-lines by the end of 2018. We're prioritizing our markets and targeting locations that currently have the highest digital sales volumes to install these new make-lines. \nWe're also testing new catering offerings, which include options for smaller groups, more convenient packaging and new lower-priced options, all of which should help accelerate growth. The test includes catering options for as low as $9 per person and for groups as small as 10 people compared to our current catering, which requires a minimum of 20 people starting at prices of $12 a person. We offer delivery support for catering in about 40% of our restaurants now, and we look forward to expanding this ahead of our peak graduation season. With these initiatives taking hold, our catering sales have grown 20% over the last year. Catering is only a little more than 1% of our sales today with tremendous opportunity for growth in the future. \nWe're also creating new restaurant designs which are optimized for mobile ordering, more ordering options, better beverage presentation and more comfortable dining areas. These new designs have the ability to be applied to our existing restaurants and to any new restaurants that we build. Additionally, we'll reinvest in our existing restaurant base as we launch a significant refresh and maintenance effort to improve the experience. We are replacing dim lighting, upgrading equipment on our service lines and addressing all areas where restaurants have become warm, both inside and outside. We'll continue to expand our digital infrastructure at our restaurants, and we'll also replace aging equipment. Some of these projects are relatively small in scope but with the potential to deliver a significant impact. Jack is going to talk in more detail on the financial impacts of these initiatives.\nChipotle has always been a purpose-driven company. We've had a relentless commitment to doing what's right for our guests and our employees. This year, we will invest more than 1/3 of our anticipated tax savings in our restaurant and support teams through a special bonus and expanded benefits. We will first invest more toward training programs for employees, including the formalized classroom program that we are establishing in Denver. We're also announcing a special bonus program for all employees this year from hourly crew, who will be eligible to earn $250 special bonus; to our restaurant general managers, who will be eligible to earn $1,000 special bonus. And we are expanding our competitive benefits program with paid maternity and paternity leave and expanding our short-term disability and life insurance plans for hourly restaurant managers. All of these enhancements are especially important in today's low unemployment and highly competitive environment, and they come in addition to our average hourly wage that we pay, which is on pace to be more than $12 at the end of 2018. And in addition to our unique slate of benefits that we offer, including discounted college tuition and tuition reimbursement for salaried and hourly employees, twice-annual merit increases, paid vacation and paid sick time, and stock awards at the restaurant manager level. \nWe have always been proud of our ability to attract and retain people who share our passion for creating an extraordinary guest experience, and our employees have rallied around our purpose to cultivate nourished communities where wholesome food is enjoyed every day. I want to thank them for their hard work and dedication to making Chipotle an amazing experience. \nChipotle is a very special brand. The past couple of years have presented a set of challenges, but I know that the changes we have made are the right ones to help us move toward achieving our full potential. We will continue to focus on our long-term success, and we'll continue to fight to preserve things that make Chipotle special. An important part of this will be to bring in a proven leader with demonstrated success in meeting the kinds of challenges we currently face. The search for a new CEO is well underway. And as soon as we have found the right person, I'll transition to the role of Executive Chairman. The board and I are committed to bringing in a world-class leader with demonstrated expertise to improve execution, build guest trust and drive sales. We do not have an update on timing today, but we'll share news of our decision as soon as the process is complete. We firmly believe that a new CEO with a passion for driving excellence across every aspect of our business will be another important step in our growth, and I'm optimistic as we look forward to the next 25 years.\nI'll now turn the call over to Jack.\nExecutives: Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. Last year held its full share of challenges, but we began 2018 with optimism that the changes made so far and the changes and investments we will make in 2018 will establish the foundation for a strong future. Our restaurant teams and field support teams are more committed than ever to delivering an excellent guest experience, and we'll continue to emphasize the guest as we significantly increase our focus and investment on training. We've established incentives for our managers and field leaders to continue to elevate the guest experience and to build sales. Our second make-line sales, including online, mobile and catering, are the fastest-growing parts of the business, and we expect that growth to continue or even accelerate. We also plan to invest much more in our existing restaurants during 2018 and beyond to create a better dining environment but ultimately to improve the overall experience and flow of our restaurants. \nI'll begin by reviewing results for the fourth quarter and full year and then provide details related to our capital reinvestment plans and tax savings from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. \nFor the fourth quarter, we reported $1.1 billion in sales on comp sales growth of 0.9%. Our reported comps include a 60 basis point decrease as we lapped Chiptopia deferred revenue in Q4 of last year. If you recall, we recognized an additional 60 basis point benefit in sales comp related to the deferred revenue in Q4 2016, and now that reduces our comp in the current period. We'll have a similar decrease in the first quarter of 2018 of about 50 basis points to our comp. Our restaurant level margins were 14.9% in the quarter, and we generated $1.55 in earnings per diluted share. Our EPS in the quarter benefited by about $0.21 related to the recent U.S. tax law changes. \nFor the full year, we reported $4.5 billion of sales on a sales comp increase of 6.4%, which includes a 30 basis point benefit related to Chiptopia. Restaurant-level margins were 16.9%, and we generated diluted earnings per share of $6.17. The Q4 underlying comp of 1.5% before the 60 basis point effect of Chiptopia was driven by a higher average check as we expanded our menu price increase to an additional 900 restaurants in November, bringing the total menu price impact during the quarter to about 240 basis points. Average check also benefited by about 200 basis points from queso, and queso continued to add about 200 basis points to the average check in January as guests are currently adding queso in a little more than 10% of our transactions. Pay traffic in the quarter was down about 3% due to the negative transaction trends that began in July of last year. \nJanuary 2018 sales comp was 3.4%. We had one extra trading day in the month as we opened on New Year's Day for the first time, and that day contributed about 240 basis points and will account for just under 1% in the comp for the first quarter. Sales were adversely impacted during the first 3 weeks of January from the series of winter storms that impacted most of the country. As the weather has normalized over the past 2 weeks, our comps have been running in the 2.5% to the 3.5% range. \nFirst quarter comparisons will get tougher as we enter mid-February and March as warm weather last year caused our comps to surge, essentially bringing our normal seasonal spring sales bump earlier than normal. If our recent sales dollar trends continue through the first quarter, we would expect a comp of between 1% and 2% before the impact of Chiptopia. \nOur full year comp guidance for 2018 is in the low single digits, with lower sales comps expected in the first half of the year due to the tougher comparisons and then improving in the second half as comparisons ease. In addition to the menu price increase last November, we completed the final round of price increases in January in about 1,000 remaining restaurants or about 40% of our restaurants. The average price increase in these markets was about 5%, and we expect resistance of around 20% or less. We expect the average check will continue to benefit by -- benefit the comp by about 2% from guests adding queso through the first 8 months of 2018 until we lap the queso roll-out in September.  Of course, all this means we will likely continue to see negative transactions until we lap the beginning of the negative transaction trend, which began in July. \nFood costs during the quarter were 34.2%, down from 35.3% in the prior year and down from 35% in Q3. The decrease from last year was driven by menu price increases, better management of paper and packaging inventories and lower priced avocados. We expect relatively stable prices in 2018, including for avocados, which along with the price increase should lower our food cost to the low to mid-33% range. California avocado growth should be on the upswing for their alternate bearing crop this summer, and we are fortunate that the recent wildfires in California are not expected to impact supply. \nLabor costs in the fourth quarter were 27.5%, flat with the prior year. Higher wage inflation of 5% was offset by a combination of factors, including labor efficiencies due to fewer promotions, lower insurance and benefit costs and slight leverage from pricing. Since early 2014, true wages and benefits have increased by a cumulative 29% but we have only increased pricing by a cumulative 12%. Our restaurant managers and crews are running some of the most efficient restaurant labor deployment we have seen in years. The labor pressures will continue at this level because of wage inflation, softer transaction trends and as we add our enhanced benefits that Steve discussed. Our labor as a percent of sales are typically flat from Q4 into Q1, although we anticipate it to increase slightly in Q1 related to regulatory minimum wage increases as of January 1, combined with the reinvestment into our employees funded by the tax savings. \nOccupancy costs for the fourth quarter were 7.6% of sales versus 7.4% last year. The higher occupancy costs are driven by inflation from renewals and slightly higher average rents from new restaurants. We anticipate new restaurant openings in 2018 to continue to have modestly higher average rents than existing restaurants due to refocusing our development pipeline with a heavier weighting toward proven markets. As a percentage of sales, occupancy for the full year should be about in line with 2017 in the low to mid-7% range as a percent of sales. \nOther operating costs were 15.8% of sales in the quarter, a decrease from 16.3% last year. Our marketing and promo costs were 3.8% of sales in the quarter, which is a decrease of about 100 basis points compared to last year. Our other operating costs also included 50 basis points of incremental costs related to maintenance and repairs. Maintenance and repairs is expected to remain at elevated levels during 2018, which I'll explain more fully in a few minutes.\nIn 2018, we anticipate marketing and promo activity will be at or slightly above 3% of sales. Marketing and promo costs will be slightly higher in the second and third quarters, with lower spending in Q1 and Q4. For the full year, we anticipate other operating costs to be about the same as last year as savings from the lower marketing and promo will be reinvested into existing restaurants with higher maintenance and repairs. With normal lower seasonal sales in the first quarter and the increased reinvestment in our restaurants, we would anticipate Q1 other operating expenses to be right around 15% of sales. \nSo overall, in Q1, the restaurant level margins are typically similar to fourth quarter with lower expected food and other operating costs and the full benefit of the price increase offset by higher maintenance and repairs investment and the investment in the special bonus for employees, Q1 margin should be in the 16% to 16.5% range. \nG&A costs for the full year 2017 were 6.6% of sales or a total of $296 million, and this includes $30 million related to the data security incident from April 2017, $60 million in stock compensation and $8 million in our employee bonus program. During 2017, our employee bonus program underperformed our targets. For the full year 2018, we anticipate G&A costs will be about $330 million, and this includes around $66 million for stock comp, $18 million for employee bonus program as we expect to return to paying bonuses at our target during 2018, $12 million for one-time executive retention bonuses and stock grants and $12 million for our biennial All Manager Conference. We expect underlying recurring G&A to grow by about $25 million after 3 years of flat G&A despite the fact that we opened more than 650 restaurants during this time. The $25 million includes the formalized new training programs and the one-time special bonuses for staff related to the savings from tax rate reduction. \nWe plan to invest a total of about $300 million in capital expenses in 2018, an increase from our 2017 investment of $217 million. For the first time ever, our capital investment into existing restaurants will outpace our investment in new restaurant openings. The total CapEx will be funded from our cash flow from operations and include several components: First, in addition to normal ongoing upkeep of a restaurant for which we would typically invest around $10,000 per restaurant or around $24 million, we'll invest another $50 million to fund a new refresh and maintenance program that Steve introduced. This $50 million is a discrete, one-time investment that will average about $20,000 per restaurant, and it will allow us to fully assess the interiors of every single restaurant, improve efficiencies, ensure that the environments are warm and welcoming for our guests. This focus on improving our restaurants is also driving higher maintenance and repair expenses, which we expect will continue throughout 2018. In early tests, we have seen modest investments can have a significant influence on the atmosphere for our guests. \nIn addition, we'll invest into new growth initiatives, including about $45 million to continue to retrofit our digitally enhanced second make-lines into existing restaurants. Including new restaurants, the digitally enhanced second make-line will be in about 1,000 restaurants by the end of the year. We'll also invest about $15 million to improve IT infrastructure, a portion of which will support and enhance our digital programs and digital experience. Our digital investments are targeted toward the fastest-growing piece of our business and will be accompanied by other digital experience enhancements and focused marketing efforts that continue to encourage digital ordering. \nBeyond digital, we'll invest about $10 million in designing new prototype restaurants. The results from these prototypes will inform both new restaurant design and remodels of our older restaurants in 2019 and in 2020. We also plan to invest around $25 million into initiatives around optimizing our energy uses in our restaurants and introduce better equipment to cook our food, such as a new rice cooker to make our restaurants more efficient. \nAnd while we're investing more aggressively into our existing restaurants, our development pipeline remains healthy and we expect to build and open around 130 to 150 new restaurants during 2018. The majority of new restaurants will continue to be built in our proven markets where we've had a loyal and growing customer base. New restaurants opened during 2017 performed at about 75% of our average sales volumes and continue to provide a strong return during the first year of operations. Our net cost to build these restaurants will be slightly higher in 2018 as every site now incorporates the new digitally enabled second make-line. \nAnd finally, we'll invest about $25 million into other general corporate initiatives, which includes the consolidation of our 2 separate offices in Denver so that we can create a more efficient and more collaborative environment. \nEffective tax rate for the full year 2017 was 36.1% compared with 40.8% in 2016. And for the quarter, our tax rate was 28.8%. This lower quarterly tax rate resulted from remeasuring our deferred tax liability at the 21% corporate federal tax rate following the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act becoming law in late December. The full year rate is lower than 2016 due to the tax rate changes along with lower state tax rates. \nWe expect the 2018 effective full year tax rate to be between 30% and 31%, with an underlying effective tax rate to be in the 27% to 28% range. There are a few moving pieces in this new rate. Relative to our normalized tax rate of about 39% the last few years our federal tax rate will decrease by 1,400 basis points as a result of the federal tax rate changes. But offsetting this decrease, our state taxes will be higher by about 100 to 200 basis points due to the reduced benefit of deducting state taxes at the new lower federal tax rate. And under the new federal tax law, we can no longer expense the full cost of our employee meals for tax purposes, which is a substantial benefit that we offer our employees. That adds another 100 basis points to our tax rate. \nThis underlying effective tax rate of 27% to 28% will then be impacted by prior and future stock-based compensation plans. We currently have deferred tax assets related to outstanding nonvested stock awards that contain market and performance conditions. If market conditions are not achieved, then we may not realize the benefit of this deferred tax asset, which will result in a higher effective tax rate at future periods. For current outstanding awards, such as the 2015 and 2016 performance stock grant, there are estimates that these awards either may not vest or may vest at lower realized values than originally anticipated. Under either scenario, we would not benefit from the initial deferred tax asset, which would negatively impact our effective tax rate by around 300 to 400 basis points. \nOverall, corporate tax law changes will result in tax savings of around $40 million to $50 million in 2018. We plan to invest more than 1/3 of these savings in our people with investments in special bonuses to our crew, managers and support staff, investment in employee training and enhanced employee benefits. The remainder of the tax savings will help fund our investment to enhance existing restaurants. \nWe continue to maintain a strong balance sheet, and we finished the year with $509 million in cash and investments and generated $467 million in cash from operations during 2017. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased $77 million of our stock at an average price of $297 per share, and we repurchased $284 million in stock during the full year 2017. Even with our increased investment in existing restaurants in 2018, we still expect to do opportunistically repurchase shares throughout the year albeit at a lower level than last year. As should be expected, our outlook for 2018 does not include any potential strategic changes that may be driven by a new CEO.\nDespite a challenging year, we feel that we have a lot of momentum and energy throughout the company heading into 2018. We're more committed than ever to continue to perfect our dining experience and to build our sales. The investments that we're making in our people and to growing our digital and catering business and investing in new innovation will not only help set up the foundation for a successful 2018 but also for the next 25 years. \nThank you, and we'll now open the lines for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is with John Glass from Morgan Stanley.\nAnalysts: First, just on top line drivers, if you could comment about, in 2018, how you're viewing either product development differently or approaching marketing differently. Does queso give you more confidence, for example, in more new product introductions in 2018 that drive traffic? When you think about marketing, the same question, your approach has been nontraditional in the past. Does that approach continue to work? Or do you think that this is the time to pivot to maybe more traditional marketing message to get traffic going again?\nExecutives: Thanks, John. So we've learned a lot over the last year as we pivoted toward more traditional marketing using television, in particular. So this year, we're going to do a number of things. Our marketing plan will consist -- traditionally has 3 big components over the year, big -- 3 big advertising components. So in the spring, we will launch another advertising campaign. This time though, it will be using addressable TV rather than broadcast TV, which was a learning that we took away from fall, where a lot of that TV were reaching lapsed customers who aren't the best target for us. So we're really focusing in more with this addressable TV on the new and current customers that we have. And then in the summer, we'll head into our 25th anniversary marketing campaign, which is largely targeted toward existing customers, although certainly, it will reach new as well. And then in the fall, there will be another large advertising campaign, which again is likely to include television. What I -- so the pivot, I think, toward more traditional advertising will continue, the one that we started last year. That's not to say that we won't do more nontraditional things as we always have. The notable difference, I think, for this year will be in the addition of a much more robust CRM platform and the inclusion of a loyalty program, which we should see in the second half of the year. So that will give us -- the combination of this more strategic approach to advertising, particularly the use of this addressable TV, along with a more robust CRM platform should allow us to reach the right customers more effectively. So there's -- so I think it is overall a pivot to slightly more traditional, if you will, advertising, but we're doing it in a very targeted way.\nAnalysts: Jack, if I could just sneak in one follow-up. You gave a number of detailed items around cost items individually. Could you just -- if you're going to hit -- if you were to hit your low single-digit comp guidance for the year in 2018, where do you think store margins land on the basis of what you just described?\nExecutives: Yes, John, I think we'll be in the -- probably in the upper teens, maybe in the 17.5% to 18%, 18.5% range, something like that. A couple of percent margin means that we would delever on the labor line, with labor inflation running in the mid-single digits and with -- only running a 2%. Even though that's driven by price, that means we're still running negative transactions. And so I think it would be in that -- probably constrained in that 17.5% to 18%, maybe as high as 18.5%, if we really get cooperation from commodities. We've also got some of the onetime things I mentioned as well, like the bonus that we're going to pay for tax savings and then the additional M&R, maintenance and repair, that we're going to in addition to extra capital. We're really going to place a heavy focus on making sure our restaurants look, feel and are a wonderful environment for our customers. I think that's about where you can expect margins to hit for the year, John.\nOperator: Our next question is with Nicole Miller from Piper Jaffray.\nAnalysts: I just had 2 quick questions. The first one, on point number two on innovations around digital and catering, how does loyalty fit into the mix there? And when might you be willing to launch a loyalty program?\nExecutives: Well, as I just said, we expect to launch a loyalty program, which is part of a larger CRM effort, in the second half of the year. So the program is being designed as we speak. And so loyalty is a subset of a larger CRM effort, which will be an important part of all of our digital marketing as well as catering -- as marketing, catering, obviously, as those are things that we market to people who we know as existing customers. So they're very much linked.\nAnalysts: And will you be -- you'll get the customer data so that you can reach out to them and this is a surprise and delight or a point dollar-based program?\nExecutives: Well, yes, I mean, absolutely. I mean, the -- Knowing the customer and having a one-to-one relationship with them is the central focus of it. The actual structure of the program is not something that we're talking about today, but absolutely, everything is on the table with regard to that.\nAnalysts: Okay. And then just a second question with regards to the 130 and 150 new stores, so how to model those. Any sequence you would offer quarterly? And then are these new stores in new markets? Are they in existing markets? And is there any international growth to speak of?\nExecutives: Yes, Nicole. They should be reasonably even fill throughout the year. Time lines always change throughout the year, but there's nothing out of the ordinary in terms of the way that they fall into the quarters. And most of them will be in proven markets. We still will see the few here and there in some of the newer markets, but most of them way over -- way more than 80% should be in our proven and established market, which gives us greater confidence that they should open and generate an attractive return right out of the box.\nExecutives: And none planned in international.\nExecutives: And nothing planned in international right now, Nicole.\nOperator: Our next question is with David Tarantino with Robert Baird.\nAnalysts: A couple of questions on the traffic trends. First, Jack, on the quarter-to-date commentary, I think you sort of pointed to an underlying trend of around 2.5% to 3.5%. Can you just confirm the level of pricing that you have in that equation so that we can get to kind of an underlying traffic number? I believe you might be running 5% pricing or higher, plus the queso.\nExecutives: Yes, it's right at 5%, David. There were some markets that had extremely high local cost, especially labor. So market by market, you would see some markets that were a little above 5%, but the overall weighted average across the country is running about 5%. We typically model in about a 20% resistance so that 5% converts to about 4%. We might see less resistance than that but -- so I would expect the comp to benefit somewhere between 4% and 5%. And then we're running 2% added to the check because of queso. So when we're running a 3%, for example, 3% positive comp, if you assume 4% from pricing and a couple of percent from queso, you could back into a negative transaction of somewhere in the 3% range.\nAnalysts: Got it. And then your guidance for the year seems to assume that doesn't get an awful lot better despite everything you're doing. Is that correct? If you look at sort of the seasonally adjusted traffic trends, are you assuming much improvement? Or are you just assuming that the year-over-year number gets better when you cycle the step-down you saw in the second half of the year?\nExecutives: Well, there's a couple of things, David. One, we do assume the back half of the year, the underlying trends do get better because comparisons get better when we compare against July. We're comparing against the beginning of the negative transaction. So we do think the transactions get better. But we have a couple of things also that roll off. We have some pricing that rolls off in April. We will compare against queso launch in September, and we'll compare against the pricing in November as well. Of course, we hope that we will build even more momentum. So we're not being overly bullish with our guidance. We're working on a number of things from an ops standpoint. From a digital standpoint, Mark mentioned loyalty. So we're hoping that we can spark a more positive transaction trend, but based on how tough it's been the last couple of years, to get that momentum going, we think this is the right level of guidance.\nAnalysts: Makes sense. And then one more if Scott Boatwright is available to answer. There's a comment about guest satisfaction scores and the new system that you're using to measure those and some early signs being good on your progress there. So I was just wondering if Scott could comment on sort of where you think you are today on those metrics and where you think you need to be to drive much better traffic trends.\nExecutives: David, Scott here. We are using Medallia as our partner in this space, and we have just really started garnering the level of survey volume necessary for statistical relevance probably over the course of the last 4 to 5 months. And we have seen pretty significant growth in overall satisfaction since September of last year with a steady increase and still -- and February still ahead of January although not fully baked but feel really good about our current trends. I feel like we are really regaining consumer confidence all across the country by some of the steps that we took later in last year to really shore up some of our operational deficiencies, and we'll see that to continue to improve. I am encouraged by the trend at this point. But to the last part of your question, I think to be best in class, we probably need to continue to improve probably another 600, 700 basis points from where we sit today.\nOperator: Our next question is with Sharon Zackfia with William Blair.\nAnalysts: A few questions. I just want to clarify, Jack, on that 1% to 2% comp for the first quarter, are you including the New Year's Day benefit in that?\nExecutives: I am, Sharon, yes. The New Year's Day overall for the quarter will give us about 1%. So that does imply that we're looking about just on top of that a 1%, positive net 1% to 2% range. And the reason is just that our sales really surged significantly in the middle of February, and we're about to go up against those numbers. So if we're lucky, we'll get mild weather again, but again, if we have kind of normal winter weather compared to how warm it was last year. 1% to 2% is about where we expect the quarter to fall.\nAnalysts: Okay. And then I guess a question on the CEO search. I think, Steve, you mentioned being a purpose-driven company, and clearly, the culture has been one of the key hallmarks over time of Chipotle. As you look for that new CEO, is that -- purpose-driven dynamic, is that a guardrail on that search? Or would somebody come in and kind of have free rein to take Chipotle in the direction he or she thinks it should go?\nExecutives: Sure, Sharon. It's a delicate balance bringing in a new CEO. Of course, you've heard of examples where new CEOs have come in but have not really been allowed to act as a CEO, and I fully intend to have the new CEO be in charge. It's been great spending time with a number of candidates. And one thing has been consistent though and that is how strongly Chipotle has impressed these folks and it's based in the purpose. So many of the candidates come from the restaurant industry and have been -- either have led them or been a key player in these brands. And while they've enjoyed a lot of success in their companies, they've never had the kind of purpose that we've had at Chipotle, which is, I think, very, very exciting to all of them. I think it's not lost on them that you can really have both. You can have a purpose and you can have a product that's very, very popular with consumers, and you can have a great economic model. And for 25 years, we never compromised on that. We had it all. And we need to get back on track and build momentum again, and all of the new CEOs realize that. I don't think you're going to see a situation where someone says, \"To hell with Food with Integrity. We're going to buy cheap commodity meat now and really turn this thing around.\" I just don't -- I don't worry that, that kind of a thing would happen.\nOperator: Our next question is with Sara Senatore with AB.\nAnalysts: One question and one follow-up, please. So the question is on the CapEx and some of the investment in the existing stores. I think the comment was that you're seeing some real benefits in terms of customer experience, but is that translating into same-store sales lift? I think a lot of times in the industry, we see lifts in the kind of mid-single-digit range when you -- when there are some upgrades to store. So just trying to get a sense of that guest experience improvement that you're seeing is actually also translating into top line. And then I do have a question on margins.\nExecutives: Sara, this is Scott Boatwright. It's a fantastic question. Once I joined the brand back last summer, I spent a great deal of time in our restaurants really from coast to coast and recognized there was a great deal of deferred maintenance across the country that needed to be addressed to ensure that we are best on block in each of the trade areas in which we operate. Unfortunately, Sara, those changes don't really alter the facade or the exterior of the Chipotle restaurants that I'm talking about. So it wouldn't garner additional traffic, but I do feel like as a great number of our guests dine in that changing the experience for those folks will -- although a slow build, will contribute to the overall sales performance here in 2018.\nAnalysts: Great. And then just on the margins, Jack, if you could talk a little bit about -- I think, a year ago or what have you, we talked about 20% restaurant margins at $2 million AUVs, and that sounds like maybe you're looking for 18% restaurant margins that -- roughly that number, even little bit higher, granted that you're reinvesting some of the tax savings as is the rest of the industry. But I guess is that 20% number off the table? And a related question, do you rethink how you approach pricing given that the nature of your pricing has meant that you've really lagged the cost inflation by quite a bit?\nExecutives: Yes. It's a good question, and let me try to answer it this way. Let me go back to Q2 of last year when our margin was at -- right around 19%, 18.9% or 19%, and then let's talk about what we can expect in the second quarter of this year, and that might be the best kind of way to show kind of before and after because second quarter of last year was right before we had the July -- where we started the negative transaction slide. So I would expect, Karen that we'd have about the same margin in the second quarter of 2018...\nAnalysts: Sara.\nExecutives: I'm sorry, Sara. That we'd have about the same margin in the second quarter of 2018, about 19%, but there's a lot of pushes and pulls. First of all, we're having a net inflection point of about 500 to 600 basis points since the transaction trend last year. We are running positive 3% and then we switched to a negative 3%. So that 500 to 600 basis points, that impacts the margin by negative, about 1.6%. The ongoing labor inflation that we've seen is about 1.2%, 1.3% or so, and that's running about a 5% margin on top of our 26% labor. The menu price increases is helping us by 300 or so basis points, and so the menu price increase essentially offsets the leverage from the comp and then the labor inflation. And then we have pushes in terms of -- this year, we're expecting lower marketing and promo but a little bit higher maintenance and repairs. The maintenance and repairs, we think, is going to be a this-year item, not a forever item but still -- so you've got all these pushes and pulls. And so while our model still has the ability at higher volumes as we can get transaction momentum growing, we can lever the model. We've seen us do that year after year after year. But this negative transaction hit is taking hits into the margin, and then menu price increase, which adds 300 basis points for the model, is eaten all up by the delever and then by the inflation. And so the important thing for us is to hopefully get some of these things that we're focused on to start transaction momentum, start positive transaction. And then on the menu price, we certainly are open to the idea, instead of waiting 3 years and raising prices to perhaps -- especially if the labor inflation is an every year thing at this level, perhaps we take a smaller increase every year, just kind of hold on to our margins in terms of regular ongoing inflation. So I hope that helps in terms of comparing the quarter's year-to-year because it really is a dramatic, different picture since the transaction turned negative.\nOperator: Our next question is with Jason West with Credit Suisse.\nAnalysts: I'm just trying to understand the level of investment that you guys need to make in the stores. You talked about some refresh of equipment and ambiance, lighting and things like that. But then you also touched on a more significant prototype change with maybe things like mobile ordering, pick-up stations and things like that. So what is the plan there? So I know this year, it feels -- it sounds like more of a refresh plan, but then is it more of a full remodel in the future? Or are you doing both at the same time? Can you talk about that a bit?\nExecutives: Yes, it's actually both at the same time. It's really low hanging fruit to change light bulbs and to freshen with new, deep thirds on the service line, the new stainless steel pans that aren't bent, things like this that really cause customers to notice that there's something different. It's shinier. It's brighter. It's cleaner. And we're going to continue to find those kinds of opportunities. Right now, we have engaged with 3 different architectural firms to create the next version of the Chipotle experience, and we've deliberately asked them to remodel existing restaurants so that this new experience can be applied to existing restaurants as well as brand-new restaurants, and we'll start to see some of those come online shortly. We've got 3 of them now mocked up as models in full-scale cardboard models in a warehouse, and we've walked through them and kicked the tires and really felt what that experience is going to be like. It's really exciting. It combines the traditional Chipotle experience along with things like digital pick-up, whether it's in-store digital or out-of-store digital, and grab and go. And it also allows for potential new menu items, so really exciting stuff and really preparing ourselves for the next 25 years.\nOperator: Our next question is with Karen Holthouse with Goldman Sachs.\nAnalysts: Another question on the side of things. So with this $50 million of spending on -- really, it's maintenance this year. It sounds like you roll off some of that. That more is onetime than ongoing in nature. Would that rolling off give you sort of more flexibility to then increase the -- or reaccelerate unit growth? Or what's sort of the governing factor on maybe getting back to prior peaks of unit growth?\nExecutives: Yes, I think on a theoretical basis, it could lead to that, but I don't think it's a matter of access to capital because we've got enough access to capital to -- through our operations and through our balance sheet to do the remodels, to do the repairs that Steve talked about. They're bringing our restaurants up to standard. And we can accelerate growth. I think the biggest driver right now is we want to give our ops teams a chance to really get on solid footing. The things that Scott put into place have really just started to take hold. We're going to put a huge emphasis on training, a refocus on training so that we can have confidence that all of our teams, all of our managers, all of our crews will know what our standards are. They can execute these standards, and they'll deliver an excellent guest experience, including great throughput. We haven't had a great throughput year in the last few years, and that takes a lot of training. So I think the new store growth reaccelerating that is going to be much more about how we feel about the ops teams. And are they on a solid footing, our training programs? Are they really taking hold? And then I think would redeploy capital into the new stores. So I wouldn't say just because capital brings up that, that automatically would move in a new store. And we're not commenting specifically on 2019 right now. I think it'd be prudent for us to get through at least half, if not 3 quarters of, 2018. And then we'll assess at that time and talk about what 2019 and beyond looks like for growth.\nOperator: Our final question is with Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays.\nAnalysts: Steve, I believe it was last quarter you talked about the next team, whether it was for menu innovation or new segments and whatnot. I know you talked about how queso was like at their first foray. So I'm just wondering with greater time now under your belt, as you think about that kind of next team, what's the early evolution or thoughts around, I think you mentioned, new segments or new day parts? How would you prioritize the different opportunities that perhaps they're coming up with as you think about the next many years? And I know you just mentioned kind of new menu items. So what do you think kind of the genesis of what's the outcome of that next team in terms of over the next year or so?\nExecutives: Sure. I think the next team's biggest opportunity is to always look at our core menu and make sure that we're cooking better food. We're sourcing better food. We have better ingredients. We're improving our preparation techniques, our cooking techniques, our serving techniques. It's what drove our business for the first couple of decades, taking a core group of menu items and continually improving them, not only through Food with Integrity but through a better restaurant execution. So that's a priority. But additionally, they need to work on new menu items, and they have a whole host of menu items. The new menu items at a place like Chipotle is tricky though. It's tricky not only because we've had the same menu for basically 25 years but because of the linear format. It's not like you can put a whole new thing up on the menu board and -- like at a typical fast food place. Ingredients sort of become part of the overall offering. So it's a tricky proposition, but it's something that we're working really, really hard on. There are exciting new offerings that are around things like salads and different kinds of grains and also an exploration of traditional things, like -- and these are things that customers are asking for, things like nachos and quesadillas. And so how to integrate those into our service format so that we can maintain throughput and sort of the level of execution that we relied on in the past is tricky. So that's something that they're focusing on also.\nAnalysts: Got it. And then, Jack, I just want to clarify. I think you said more than 1/3 of the tax savings, you're going to reinvest. It sounds like a lot of it is more onetime in nature versus ongoing, but did you say something about the remaining 2/3? I thought you said maybe you'd be reinvesting that as well. Or should we assume that the remainder gets returned to shareholders?\nExecutives: Well, in essence, what we did say is that will help us fund the increase in CapEx, but we'll continue, Jeff. We'll continue to generate more than enough capital to support the -- from operations to support our CapEx. We still have a strong balance sheet. So you can expect us to continue to return cash to shareholder not necessarily in incremental amount. I think the incremental amount that we're getting from taxes is going to be funneled into the extra CapEx and to our existing restaurant. We still have room that we can return some of our capital to shareholders as well through buyback.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call over back to Mark Alexee for closing remarks.\nExecutives: Great. Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to sharing our Q1 results with you, which again is planned for Tuesday, April 24. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, thank you for your participation.\nOperator: Greetings, and welcome to Chipotle Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mark Alexee, Investor Relations Manager. Please go ahead.\nExecutives: Hello, everyone, and welcome to our call today.

For the first quarter of 2018, it will begin March 16 and continue through our first quarter earnings release planned for April 24, 2018. \nWe will start today's call with some brief prepared remarks and then open the line for questions. On the call with us today are Steve Ells, our Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jack Hartung, Chief Financial Officer. Scott Boatwright, Chief Restaurant Officer; Mark Crumpacker, our Chief Marketing and Strategy Officer; Curt Garner, Chief Digital and Information Officer; and Laurie Schalow, Chief Communications Officer, are also with us and available during the Q&A period.\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to Steve.\nExecutives: Thanks, Mark, and good afternoon, everyone. In 2018, Chipotle will celebrate its 25th anniversary. This is an ideal time to reflect on the things that have contributed to our success over the past 25 years while at the same time provide an update on the fundamental changes we are making across the business to enable us to get back on a strong growth trajectory and realize our vast potential. \nAs I think back on the past 25 years, I'm extremely proud of the unique company we've created. Our success is based on our passion for serving great-tasting, wholesome food that's served in an interactive environment. It has been our vision and the commitment of doing what is right for our guests, employees, suppliers and farmers, the environment and animals well before these things were common in the world of fast food, all while delivering a superior economic model that has led to our success. When I started Chipotle, I wanted to show that just because food is served fast doesn't mean it has to be a typical fast food experience. It wasn't a commonly held view at the time, but it certainly has paid off. I continue to believe that this approach to serving nutritious, wholesome and delicious food remains highly valued by our guests and can deliver strong returns to our shareholders.\nNow after 25 years, we must navigate new challenges by continuing to evolve how we approach the business. Our results for the quarter clearly show that there is still work to be done to restore strong growth and customer trust. And today, I want to discuss the progress we're making on a number of initiatives that will transform how we manage the company and that will provide a solid foundation for how we build the business going forward. \nToday, I want to talk about 3 key areas of focus: first, our operational changes and efforts to perfect the guest experience; second, enhancing the guest experience through innovations in digital and catering; and third, reinvesting in our existing restaurants to enhance guest convenience and improve the appearance and function of our restaurants. In addition, I'll provide an update on our CEO search. \nFirst, let me discuss the operational changes and efforts to perfect the dining experience. After spending time in our restaurants over the past few months, I've seen firsthand the impact Scott Boatwright and his team are having on our operations. Shifting our operational culture requires leadership, determination and time to retrain and build new habits. Our field leaders are spending time with managers to focus on what it takes to effectively train our teams to deliver an excellent guest experience. Scott and his team have formalized the role of the manager and the role of the field leader to ensure all their efforts are focused on the guest experience. And our support teams are building extensive, detailed trading programs to provide the necessary tools for this type of change. We're also launching a dedicated, centralized training program based in Denver. This program combines classroom teaching, which is new to Chipotle, with live, in-store training in a certified Chipotle restaurant. The curriculum has been tailored to our field leaders to ensure we are effectively addressing the most important elements of delivering a great guest experience. That effort is beginning to pay off as we develop consistency around the speed of service and improving hospitality from every crew member. \nWe're revisiting the concept of throughput, which has historically been an incredible strength of our business. As our training program continues to take hold, our teams will be primed to refocus on delivering excellent throughput in the restaurant again and will be looking at various ways to incentivize terrific throughput. When executed correctly with well-trained crew, throughput is one of the best tools we've had to build sales and to build our brand. \nWe also completed the restructuring of our field leadership, reducing the number of regions and eliminating unnecessary layers above the restaurant. Our field leader ratios have been reduced, enabling our strong field leaders to spend more time in each restaurant. This has had a direct and lasting impact on the restaurant teams. \nAnd over the past 6 months, we've implemented a new guest satisfaction system in our restaurants, and we are encouraged by improvements we've seen across all measures, including key areas of friendliness and ease of ordering. These renewed efforts come in addition to the incentive program changes we instituted at the restaurant level 1 year ago, which makes the guest experience a key component of incentive compensation for our restaurant and field teams. \nWith early signs of an improved guest experience, we are excited to celebrate our 25th anniversary with all of our guests, employees and partners. We will incorporate the 25th anniversary celebration into many of our marketing and promotional campaigns this year, and it will be a rallying point for our brand. We have passionate and loyal fans that love Chipotle, and it's a great opportunity to share their stories along with reminding our guests of all the things that make us unique and special. We'll share more of this campaign with you on our first quarter call.\nNow let me turn to how we are enhancing the guest experience to build sales through innovations in digital and catering. It's clear we must also ensure that we are offering new and convenient ways for our guests to interact with Chipotle. For much of our 25-year history, innovation at Chipotle rightfully focused on sourcing better ingredients, improving our cooking techniques and making our kitchens and equipment more efficient. But over the last year, we've been building new competencies around improving the guest experience through technology and testing new or enhanced offerings. Each of these is designed to improve convenience, add interest to our menu and deliver a better overall experience for our guests. Our digital sales continue to be the fastest-growing part of our business. We hit new records in the fourth quarter as our second make-line sales were up 33% over the prior year. Our digital sales mix was 8.6% of sales, while 2 of our regions have digital sales of more than 10% of their overall mix. We continue to be optimistic as we further market this capability and as guests increasingly order Chipotle through digital platforms. \nThis digital sales growth has been led by mobile ordering, which is up 50% over last year, and the increase has been driven by the new version of our mobile app for Apple and Android. The app's new features include quick reorder of favorite or recent orders and the ability to receive, store and redeem offers. The app also introduces new mobile pay options, a more user-friendly store locator and a streamlined user experience with enhanced design and guest response has been consistently positive since the launch. For instance, average monthly users on mobile have more than doubled since the release of the app. \nWe're also seeing higher guest satisfaction in the restaurants that have the new second make-line, and we've seen further reduction in guest wait times to under 15 minutes as we continue to optimize our Smarter Pickup Times. In 2018, we will accelerate the roll-out of our digitally enabled second make-lines. These new lines enable a faster and more accurate experience for our digital customers and allow our crews to more easily support the higher sales volumes. Cumulatively, including new restaurants, we expect to have at least 30% of our restaurants outfitted with these new second make-lines by the end of 2018. We're prioritizing our markets and targeting locations that currently have the highest digital sales volumes to install these new make-lines. \nWe're also testing new catering offerings, which include options for smaller groups, more convenient packaging and new lower-priced options, all of which should help accelerate growth. The test includes catering options for as low as $9 per person and for groups as small as 10 people compared to our current catering, which requires a minimum of 20 people starting at prices of $12 a person. We offer delivery support for catering in about 40% of our restaurants now, and we look forward to expanding this ahead of our peak graduation season. With these initiatives taking hold, our catering sales have grown 20% over the last year. Catering is only a little more than 1% of our sales today with tremendous opportunity for growth in the future. \nWe're also creating new restaurant designs which are optimized for mobile ordering, more ordering options, better beverage presentation and more comfortable dining areas. These new designs have the ability to be applied to our existing restaurants and to any new restaurants that we build. Additionally, we'll reinvest in our existing restaurant base as we launch a significant refresh and maintenance effort to improve the experience. We are replacing dim lighting, upgrading equipment on our service lines and addressing all areas where restaurants have become warm, both inside and outside. We'll continue to expand our digital infrastructure at our restaurants, and we'll also replace aging equipment. Some of these projects are relatively small in scope but with the potential to deliver a significant impact. Jack is going to talk in more detail on the financial impacts of these initiatives.\nChipotle has always been a purpose-driven company. We've had a relentless commitment to doing what's right for our guests and our employees. This year, we will invest more than 1/3 of our anticipated tax savings in our restaurant and support teams through a special bonus and expanded benefits. We will first invest more toward training programs for employees, including the formalized classroom program that we are establishing in Denver. We're also announcing a special bonus program for all employees this year from hourly crew, who will be eligible to earn $250 special bonus; to our restaurant general managers, who will be eligible to earn $1,000 special bonus. And we are expanding our competitive benefits program with paid maternity and paternity leave and expanding our short-term disability and life insurance plans for hourly restaurant managers. All of these enhancements are especially important in today's low unemployment and highly competitive environment, and they come in addition to our average hourly wage that we pay, which is on pace to be more than $12 at the end of 2018. And in addition to our unique slate of benefits that we offer, including discounted college tuition and tuition reimbursement for salaried and hourly employees, twice-annual merit increases, paid vacation and paid sick time, and stock awards at the restaurant manager level. \nWe have always been proud of our ability to attract and retain people who share our passion for creating an extraordinary guest experience, and our employees have rallied around our purpose to cultivate nourished communities where wholesome food is enjoyed every day. I want to thank them for their hard work and dedication to making Chipotle an amazing experience. \nChipotle is a very special brand. The past couple of years have presented a set of challenges, but I know that the changes we have made are the right ones to help us move toward achieving our full potential. We will continue to focus on our long-term success, and we'll continue to fight to preserve things that make Chipotle special. An important part of this will be to bring in a proven leader with demonstrated success in meeting the kinds of challenges we currently face. The search for a new CEO is well underway. And as soon as we have found the right person, I'll transition to the role of Executive Chairman. The board and I are committed to bringing in a world-class leader with demonstrated expertise to improve execution, build guest trust and drive sales. We do not have an update on timing today, but we'll share news of our decision as soon as the process is complete. We firmly believe that a new CEO with a passion for driving excellence across every aspect of our business will be another important step in our growth, and I'm optimistic as we look forward to the next 25 years.\nI'll now turn the call over to Jack.\nExecutives: Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. Last year held its full share of challenges, but we began 2018 with optimism that the changes made so far and the changes and investments we will make in 2018 will establish the foundation for a strong future. Our restaurant teams and field support teams are more committed than ever to delivering an excellent guest experience, and we'll continue to emphasize the guest as we significantly increase our focus and investment on training. We've established incentives for our managers and field leaders to continue to elevate the guest experience and to build sales. Our second make-line sales, including online, mobile and catering, are the fastest-growing parts of the business, and we expect that growth to continue or even accelerate. We also plan to invest much more in our existing restaurants during 2018 and beyond to create a better dining environment but ultimately to improve the overall experience and flow of our restaurants. \nI'll begin by reviewing results for the fourth quarter and full year and then provide details related to our capital reinvestment plans and tax savings from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. \nFor the fourth quarter, we reported $1.1 billion in sales on comp sales growth of 0.9%. Our reported comps include a 60 basis point decrease as we lapped Chiptopia deferred revenue in Q4 of last year. If you recall, we recognized an additional 60 basis point benefit in sales comp related to the deferred revenue in Q4 2016, and now that reduces our comp in the current period. We'll have a similar decrease in the first quarter of 2018 of about 50 basis points to our comp. Our restaurant level margins were 14.9% in the quarter, and we generated $1.55 in earnings per diluted share. Our EPS in the quarter benefited by about $0.21 related to the recent U.S. tax law changes. \nFor the full year, we reported $4.5 billion of sales on a sales comp increase of 6.4%, which includes a 30 basis point benefit related to Chiptopia. Restaurant-level margins were 16.9%, and we generated diluted earnings per share of $6.17. The Q4 underlying comp of 1.5% before the 60 basis point effect of Chiptopia was driven by a higher average check as we expanded our menu price increase to an additional 900 restaurants in November, bringing the total menu price impact during the quarter to about 240 basis points. Average check also benefited by about 200 basis points from queso, and queso continued to add about 200 basis points to the average check in January as guests are currently adding queso in a little more than 10% of our transactions. Pay traffic in the quarter was down about 3% due to the negative transaction trends that began in July of last year. \nJanuary 2018 sales comp was 3.4%. We had one extra trading day in the month as we opened on New Year's Day for the first time, and that day contributed about 240 basis points and will account for just under 1% in the comp for the first quarter. Sales were adversely impacted during the first 3 weeks of January from the series of winter storms that impacted most of the country. As the weather has normalized over the past 2 weeks, our comps have been running in the 2.5% to the 3.5% range. \nFirst quarter comparisons will get tougher as we enter mid-February and March as warm weather last year caused our comps to surge, essentially bringing our normal seasonal spring sales bump earlier than normal. If our recent sales dollar trends continue through the first quarter, we would expect a comp of between 1% and 2% before the impact of Chiptopia. \nOur full year comp guidance for 2018 is in the low single digits, with lower sales comps expected in the first half of the year due to the tougher comparisons and then improving in the second half as comparisons ease. In addition to the menu price increase last November, we completed the final round of price increases in January in about 1,000 remaining restaurants or about 40% of our restaurants. The average price increase in these markets was about 5%, and we expect resistance of around 20% or less. We expect the average check will continue to benefit by -- benefit the comp by about 2% from guests adding queso through the first 8 months of 2018 until we lap the queso roll-out in September.  Of course, all this means we will likely continue to see negative transactions until we lap the beginning of the negative transaction trend, which began in July. \nFood costs during the quarter were 34.2%, down from 35.3% in the prior year and down from 35% in Q3. The decrease from last year was driven by menu price increases, better management of paper and packaging inventories and lower priced avocados. We expect relatively stable prices in 2018, including for avocados, which along with the price increase should lower our food cost to the low to mid-33% range. California avocado growth should be on the upswing for their alternate bearing crop this summer, and we are fortunate that the recent wildfires in California are not expected to impact supply. \nLabor costs in the fourth quarter were 27.5%, flat with the prior year. Higher wage inflation of 5% was offset by a combination of factors, including labor efficiencies due to fewer promotions, lower insurance and benefit costs and slight leverage from pricing. Since early 2014, true wages and benefits have increased by a cumulative 29% but we have only increased pricing by a cumulative 12%. Our restaurant managers and crews are running some of the most efficient restaurant labor deployment we have seen in years. The labor pressures will continue at this level because of wage inflation, softer transaction trends and as we add our enhanced benefits that Steve discussed. Our labor as a percent of sales are typically flat from Q4 into Q1, although we anticipate it to increase slightly in Q1 related to regulatory minimum wage increases as of January 1, combined with the reinvestment into our employees funded by the tax savings. \nOccupancy costs for the fourth quarter were 7.6% of sales versus 7.4% last year. The higher occupancy costs are driven by inflation from renewals and slightly higher average rents from new restaurants. We anticipate new restaurant openings in 2018 to continue to have modestly higher average rents than existing restaurants due to refocusing our development pipeline with a heavier weighting toward proven markets. As a percentage of sales, occupancy for the full year should be about in line with 2017 in the low to mid-7% range as a percent of sales. \nOther operating costs were 15.8% of sales in the quarter, a decrease from 16.3% last year. Our marketing and promo costs were 3.8% of sales in the quarter, which is a decrease of about 100 basis points compared to last year. Our other operating costs also included 50 basis points of incremental costs related to maintenance and repairs. Maintenance and repairs is expected to remain at elevated levels during 2018, which I'll explain more fully in a few minutes.\nIn 2018, we anticipate marketing and promo activity will be at or slightly above 3% of sales. Marketing and promo costs will be slightly higher in the second and third quarters, with lower spending in Q1 and Q4. For the full year, we anticipate other operating costs to be about the same as last year as savings from the lower marketing and promo will be reinvested into existing restaurants with higher maintenance and repairs. With normal lower seasonal sales in the first quarter and the increased reinvestment in our restaurants, we would anticipate Q1 other operating expenses to be right around 15% of sales. \nSo overall, in Q1, the restaurant level margins are typically similar to fourth quarter with lower expected food and other operating costs and the full benefit of the price increase offset by higher maintenance and repairs investment and the investment in the special bonus for employees, Q1 margin should be in the 16% to 16.5% range. \nG&A costs for the full year 2017 were 6.6% of sales or a total of $296 million, and this includes $30 million related to the data security incident from April 2017, $60 million in stock compensation and $8 million in our employee bonus program. During 2017, our employee bonus program underperformed our targets. For the full year 2018, we anticipate G&A costs will be about $330 million, and this includes around $66 million for stock comp, $18 million for employee bonus program as we expect to return to paying bonuses at our target during 2018, $12 million for one-time executive retention bonuses and stock grants and $12 million for our biennial All Manager Conference. We expect underlying recurring G&A to grow by about $25 million after 3 years of flat G&A despite the fact that we opened more than 650 restaurants during this time. The $25 million includes the formalized new training programs and the one-time special bonuses for staff related to the savings from tax rate reduction. \nWe plan to invest a total of about $300 million in capital expenses in 2018, an increase from our 2017 investment of $217 million. For the first time ever, our capital investment into existing restaurants will outpace our investment in new restaurant openings. The total CapEx will be funded from our cash flow from operations and include several components: First, in addition to normal ongoing upkeep of a restaurant for which we would typically invest around $10,000 per restaurant or around $24 million, we'll invest another $50 million to fund a new refresh and maintenance program that Steve introduced. This $50 million is a discrete, one-time investment that will average about $20,000 per restaurant, and it will allow us to fully assess the interiors of every single restaurant, improve efficiencies, ensure that the environments are warm and welcoming for our guests. This focus on improving our restaurants is also driving higher maintenance and repair expenses, which we expect will continue throughout 2018. In early tests, we have seen modest investments can have a significant influence on the atmosphere for our guests. \nIn addition, we'll invest into new growth initiatives, including about $45 million to continue to retrofit our digitally enhanced second make-lines into existing restaurants. Including new restaurants, the digitally enhanced second make-line will be in about 1,000 restaurants by the end of the year. We'll also invest about $15 million to improve IT infrastructure, a portion of which will support and enhance our digital programs and digital experience. Our digital investments are targeted toward the fastest-growing piece of our business and will be accompanied by other digital experience enhancements and focused marketing efforts that continue to encourage digital ordering. \nBeyond digital, we'll invest about $10 million in designing new prototype restaurants. The results from these prototypes will inform both new restaurant design and remodels of our older restaurants in 2019 and in 2020. We also plan to invest around $25 million into initiatives around optimizing our energy uses in our restaurants and introduce better equipment to cook our food, such as a new rice cooker to make our restaurants more efficient. \nAnd while we're investing more aggressively into our existing restaurants, our development pipeline remains healthy and we expect to build and open around 130 to 150 new restaurants during 2018. The majority of new restaurants will continue to be built in our proven markets where we've had a loyal and growing customer base. New restaurants opened during 2017 performed at about 75% of our average sales volumes and continue to provide a strong return during the first year of operations. Our net cost to build these restaurants will be slightly higher in 2018 as every site now incorporates the new digitally enabled second make-line. \nAnd finally, we'll invest about $25 million into other general corporate initiatives, which includes the consolidation of our 2 separate offices in Denver so that we can create a more efficient and more collaborative environment. \nEffective tax rate for the full year 2017 was 36.1% compared with 40.8% in 2016. And for the quarter, our tax rate was 28.8%. This lower quarterly tax rate resulted from remeasuring our deferred tax liability at the 21% corporate federal tax rate following the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act becoming law in late December. The full year rate is lower than 2016 due to the tax rate changes along with lower state tax rates. \nWe expect the 2018 effective full year tax rate to be between 30% and 31%, with an underlying effective tax rate to be in the 27% to 28% range. There are a few moving pieces in this new rate. Relative to our normalized tax rate of about 39% the last few years our federal tax rate will decrease by 1,400 basis points as a result of the federal tax rate changes. But offsetting this decrease, our state taxes will be higher by about 100 to 200 basis points due to the reduced benefit of deducting state taxes at the new lower federal tax rate. And under the new federal tax law, we can no longer expense the full cost of our employee meals for tax purposes, which is a substantial benefit that we offer our employees. That adds another 100 basis points to our tax rate. \nThis underlying effective tax rate of 27% to 28% will then be impacted by prior and future stock-based compensation plans. We currently have deferred tax assets related to outstanding nonvested stock awards that contain market and performance conditions. If market conditions are not achieved, then we may not realize the benefit of this deferred tax asset, which will result in a higher effective tax rate at future periods. For current outstanding awards, such as the 2015 and 2016 performance stock grant, there are estimates that these awards either may not vest or may vest at lower realized values than originally anticipated. Under either scenario, we would not benefit from the initial deferred tax asset, which would negatively impact our effective tax rate by around 300 to 400 basis points. \nOverall, corporate tax law changes will result in tax savings of around $40 million to $50 million in 2018. We plan to invest more than 1/3 of these savings in our people with investments in special bonuses to our crew, managers and support staff, investment in employee training and enhanced employee benefits. The remainder of the tax savings will help fund our investment to enhance existing restaurants. \nWe continue to maintain a strong balance sheet, and we finished the year with $509 million in cash and investments and generated $467 million in cash from operations during 2017. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased $77 million of our stock at an average price of $297 per share, and we repurchased $284 million in stock during the full year 2017. Even with our increased investment in existing restaurants in 2018, we still expect to do opportunistically repurchase shares throughout the year albeit at a lower level than last year. As should be expected, our outlook for 2018 does not include any potential strategic changes that may be driven by a new CEO.\nDespite a challenging year, we feel that we have a lot of momentum and energy throughout the company heading into 2018. We're more committed than ever to continue to perfect our dining experience and to build our sales. The investments that we're making in our people and to growing our digital and catering business and investing in new innovation will not only help set up the foundation for a successful 2018 but also for the next 25 years. \nThank you, and we'll now open the lines for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is with John Glass from Morgan Stanley.\nAnalysts: First, just on top line drivers, if you could comment about, in 2018, how you're viewing either product development differently or approaching marketing differently. Does queso give you more confidence, for example, in more new product introductions in 2018 that drive traffic? When you think about marketing, the same question, your approach has been nontraditional in the past. Does that approach continue to work? Or do you think that this is the time to pivot to maybe more traditional marketing message to get traffic going again?\nExecutives: Thanks, John. So we've learned a lot over the last year as we pivoted toward more traditional marketing using television, in particular. So this year, we're going to do a number of things. Our marketing plan will consist -- traditionally has 3 big components over the year, big -- 3 big advertising components. So in the spring, we will launch another advertising campaign. This time though, it will be using addressable TV rather than broadcast TV, which was a learning that we took away from fall, where a lot of that TV were reaching lapsed customers who aren't the best target for us. So we're really focusing in more with this addressable TV on the new and current customers that we have. And then in the summer, we'll head into our 25th anniversary marketing campaign, which is largely targeted toward existing customers, although certainly, it will reach new as well. And then in the fall, there will be another large advertising campaign, which again is likely to include television. What I -- so the pivot, I think, toward more traditional advertising will continue, the one that we started last year. That's not to say that we won't do more nontraditional things as we always have. The notable difference, I think, for this year will be in the addition of a much more robust CRM platform and the inclusion of a loyalty program, which we should see in the second half of the year. So that will give us -- the combination of this more strategic approach to advertising, particularly the use of this addressable TV, along with a more robust CRM platform should allow us to reach the right customers more effectively. So there's -- so I think it is overall a pivot to slightly more traditional, if you will, advertising, but we're doing it in a very targeted way.\nAnalysts: Jack, if I could just sneak in one follow-up. You gave a number of detailed items around cost items individually. Could you just -- if you're going to hit -- if you were to hit your low single-digit comp guidance for the year in 2018, where do you think store margins land on the basis of what you just described?\nExecutives: Yes, John, I think we'll be in the -- probably in the upper teens, maybe in the 17.5% to 18%, 18.5% range, something like that. A couple of percent margin means that we would delever on the labor line, with labor inflation running in the mid-single digits and with -- only running a 2%. Even though that's driven by price, that means we're still running negative transactions. And so I think it would be in that -- probably constrained in that 17.5% to 18%, maybe as high as 18.5%, if we really get cooperation from commodities. We've also got some of the onetime things I mentioned as well, like the bonus that we're going to pay for tax savings and then the additional M&R, maintenance and repair, that we're going to in addition to extra capital. We're really going to place a heavy focus on making sure our restaurants look, feel and are a wonderful environment for our customer sites. I think that's about where you can expect margins to hit for the year, John.\nOperator: Our next question is with Nicole Miller from Piper Jaffray.\nAnalysts: I just had 2 quick questions. The first one, on point number two on innovations around digital and catering, how does loyalty fit into the mix there? And when might you be willing to launch a loyalty program?\nExecutives: Well, as I just said, we expect to launch a loyalty program, which is part of a larger CRM effort, in the second half of the year. So the program is being designed as we speak. And so loyalty is a subset of a larger CRM effort, which will be an important part of all of our digital marketing as well as catering -- as marketing, catering, obviously, as those are things that we market to people who we know as existing customers. So they're very much linked.\nAnalysts: And will you be -- you'll get the customer data so that you can reach out to them and this is a surprise and delight or a point dollar-based program?\nExecutives: Well, yes, I mean, absolutely. I mean, the -- Knowing the customer and having a one-to-one relationship with them is the central focus of it. The actual structure of the program is not something that we're talking about today, but absolutely, everything is on the table with regard to that.\nAnalysts: Okay. And then just a second question with regards to the 130 and 150 new stores, so how to model those. Any sequence you would offer quarterly? And then are these new stores in new markets? Are they in existing markets? And is there any international growth to speak of?\nExecutives: Yes, Nicole. They should be reasonably even fill throughout the year. Time lines always change throughout the year, but there's nothing out of the ordinary in terms of the way that they fall into the quarters. And most of them will be in proven markets. We still will see the few here and there in some of the newer markets, but most of them way over -- way more than 80% should be in our proven and established market, which gives us greater confidence that they should open and generate an attractive return right out of the box.\nExecutives: And none planned in international.\nExecutives: And nothing planned in international right now, Nicole.\nOperator: Our next question is with David Tarantino with Robert Baird.\nAnalysts: A couple of questions on the traffic trends. First, Jack, on the quarter-to-date commentary, I think you sort of pointed to an underlying trend of around 2.5% to 3.5%. Can you just confirm the level of pricing that you have in that equation so that we can get to kind of an underlying traffic number? I believe you might be running 5% pricing or higher, plus the queso.\nExecutives: Yes, it's right at 5%, David. There were some markets that had extremely high local cost, especially labor. So market by market, you would see some markets that were a little above 5%, but the overall weighted average across the country is running about 5%. We typically model in about a 20% resistance so that 5% converts to about 4%. We might see less resistance than that but -- so I would expect the comp to benefit somewhere between 4% and 5%. And then we're running 2% added to the check because of queso. So when we're running a 3%, for example, 3% positive comp, if you assume 4% from pricing and a couple of percent from queso, you could back into a negative transaction of somewhere in the 3% range.\nAnalysts: Got it. And then your guidance for the year seems to assume that doesn't get an awful lot better despite everything you're doing. Is that correct? If you look at sort of the seasonally adjusted traffic trends, are you assuming much improvement? Or are you just assuming that the year-over-year number gets better when you cycle the step-down you saw in the second half of the year?\nExecutives: Well, there's a couple of things, David. One, we do assume the back half of the year, the underlying trends do get better because comparisons get better when we compare against July. We're comparing against the beginning of the negative transaction. So we do think the transactions get better. But we have a couple of things also that roll off. We have some pricing that rolls off in April. We will compare against queso launch in September, and we'll compare against the pricing in November as well. Of course, we hope that we will build even more momentum. So we're not being overly bullish with our guidance. We're working on a number of things from an ops standpoint. From a digital standpoint, Mark mentioned loyalty. So we're hoping that we can spark a more positive transaction trend, but based on how tough it's been the last couple of years, to get that momentum going, we think this is the right level of guidance.\nAnalysts: Makes sense. And then one more if Scott Boatwright is available to answer. There's a comment about guest satisfaction scores and the new system that you're using to measure those and some early signs being good on your progress there. So I was just wondering if Scott could comment on sort of where you think you are today on those metrics and where you think you need to be to drive much better traffic trends.\nExecutives: David, Scott here. We are using Medallia as our partner in this space, and we have just really started garnering the level of survey volume necessary for statistical relevance probably over the course of the last 4 to 5 months. And we have seen pretty significant growth in overall satisfaction since September of last year with a steady increase and still -- and February still ahead of January although not fully baked but feel really good about our current trends. I feel like we are really regaining consumer confidence all across the country by some of the steps that we took later in last year to really shore up some of our operational deficiencies, and we'll see that to continue to improve. I am encouraged by the trend at this point. But to the last part of your question, I think to be best in class, we probably need to continue to improve probably another 600, 700 basis points from where we sit today.\nOperator: Our next question is with Sharon Zackfia with William Blair.\nAnalysts: A few questions. I just want to clarify, Jack, on that 1% to 2% comp for the first quarter, are you including the New Year's Day benefit in that?\nExecutives: I am, Sharon, yes. The New Year's Day overall for the quarter will give us about 1%. So that does imply that we're looking about just on top of that a 1%, positive net 1% to 2% range. And the reason is just that our sales really surged significantly in the middle of February, and we're about to go up against those numbers. So if we're lucky, we'll get mild weather again, but again, if we have kind of normal winter weather compared to how warm it was last year. 1% to 2% is about where we expect the quarter to fall.\nAnalysts: Okay. And then I guess a question on the CEO search. I think, Steve, you mentioned being a purpose-driven company, and clearly, the culture has been one of the key hallmarks over time of Chipotle. As you look for that new CEO, is that -- purpose-driven dynamic, is that a guardrail on that search? Or would somebody come in and kind of have free rein to take Chipotle in the direction he or she thinks it should go?\nExecutives: Sure, Sharon. It's a delicate balance bringing in a new CEO. Of course, you've heard of examples where new CEOs have come in but have not really been allowed to act as a CEO, and I fully intend to have the new CEO be in charge. It's been great spending time with a number of candidates. And one thing has been consistent though and that is how strongly Chipotle has impressed these folks and it's based in the purpose. So many of the candidates come from the restaurant industry and have been -- either have led them or been a key player in these brands. And while they've enjoyed a lot of success in their companies, they've never had the kind of purpose that we've had at Chipotle, which is, I think, very, very exciting to all of them. I think it's not lost on them that you can really have both. You can have a purpose and you can have a product that's very, very popular with consumers, and you can have a great economic model. And for 25 years, we never compromised on that. We had it all. And we need to get back on track and build momentum again, and all of the new CEOs realize that. I don't think you're going to see a situation where someone says, \"To hell with Food with Integrity. We're going to buy cheap commodity meat now and really turn this thing around.\" I just don't -- I don't worry that, that kind of a thing would happen.\nOperator: Our next question is with Sara Senatore with AB.\nAnalysts: One question and one follow-up, please. So the question is on the CapEx and some of the investment in the existing stores. I think the comment was that you're seeing some real benefits in terms of customer experience, but is that translating into same-store sales lift? I think a lot of times in the industry, we see lifts in the kind of mid-single-digit range when you -- when there are some upgrades to store. So just trying to get a sense of that guest experience improvement that you're seeing is actually also translating into top line. And then I do have a question on margins.\nExecutives: Sara, this is Scott Boatwright. It's a fantastic question. Once I joined the brand back last summer, I spent a great deal of time in our restaurants really from coast to coast and recognized there was a great deal of deferred maintenance across the country that needed to be addressed to ensure that we are best on block in each of the trade areas in which we operate. Unfortunately, Sara, those changes don't really alter the facade or the exterior of the Chipotle restaurants that I'm talking about. So it wouldn't garner additional traffic, but I do feel like as a great number of our guests dine in that changing the experience for those folks will -- although a slow build, will contribute to the overall sales performance here in 2018.\nAnalysts: Great. And then just on the margins, Jack, if you could talk a little bit about -- I think, a year ago or what have you, we talked about 20% restaurant margins at $2 million AUVs, and that sounds like maybe you're looking for 18% restaurant margins that -- roughly that number, even little bit higher, granted that you're reinvesting some of the tax savings as is the rest of the industry. But I guess is that 20% number off the table? And a related question, do you rethink how you approach pricing given that the nature of your pricing has meant that you've really lagged the cost inflation by quite a bit?\nExecutives: Yes. It's a good question, and let me try to answer it this way. Let me go back to Q2 of last year when our margin was at -- right around 19%, 18.9% or 19%, and then let's talk about what we can expect in the second quarter of this year, and that might be the best kind of way to show kind of before and after because second quarter of last year was right before we had the July -- where we started the negative transaction slide. So I would expect, Karen that we'd have about the same margin in the second quarter of 2018...\nAnalysts: Sara.\nExecutives: I'm sorry, Sara. That we'd have about the same margin in the second quarter of 2018, about 19%, but there's a lot of pushes and pulls. First of all, we're having a net inflection point of about 500 to 600 basis points since the transaction trend last year. We are running positive 3% and then we switched to a negative 3%. So that 500 to 600 basis points, that impacts the margin by negative, about 1.6%. The ongoing labor inflation that we've seen is about 1.2%, 1.3% or so, and that's running about a 5% margin on top of our 26% labor. The menu price increases is helping us by 300 or so basis points, and so the menu price increase essentially offsets the leverage from the comp and then the labor inflation. And then we have pushes in terms of -- this year, we're expecting lower marketing and promo but a little bit higher maintenance and repairs. The maintenance and repairs, we think, is going to be a this-year item, not a forever item but still -- so you've got all these pushes and pulls. And so while our model still has the ability at higher volumes as we can get transaction momentum growing, we can lever the model. We've seen us do that year after year after year. But this negative transaction hit is taking hits into the margin, and then menu price increase, which adds 300 basis points for the model, is eaten all up by the delever and then by the inflation. And so the important thing for us is to hopefully get some of these things that we're focused on to start transaction momentum, start positive transaction. And then on the menu price, we certainly are open to the idea, instead of waiting 3 years and raising prices to perhaps -- especially if the labor inflation is an every year thing at this level, perhaps we take a smaller increase every year, just kind of hold on to our margins in terms of regular ongoing inflation. So I hope that helps in terms of comparing the quarter's year-to-year because it really is a dramatic, different picture since the transaction turned negative.\nOperator: Our next question is with Jason West with Credit Suisse.\nAnalysts: I'm just trying to understand the level of investment that you guys need to make in the stores. You talked about some refresh of equipment and ambiance, lighting and things like that. But then you also touched on a more significant prototype change with maybe things like mobile ordering, pick-up stations and things like that. So what is the plan there? So I know this year, it feels -- it sounds like more of a refresh plan, but then is it more of a full remodel in the future? Or are you doing both at the same time? Can you talk about that a bit?\nExecutives: Yes, it's actually both at the same time. It's really low hanging fruit to change light bulbs and to freshen with new, deep thirds on the service line, the new stainless steel pans that aren't bent, things like this that really cause customers to notice that there's something different. It's shinier. It's brighter. It's cleaner. And we're going to continue to find those kinds of opportunities. Right now, we have engaged with 3 different architectural firms to create the next version of the Chipotle experience, and we've deliberately asked them to remodel existing restaurants so that this new experience can be applied to existing restaurants as well as brand-new restaurants, and we'll start to see some of those come online shortly. We've got 3 of them now mocked up as models in full-scale cardboard models in a warehouse, and we've walked through them and kicked the tires and really felt what that experience is going to be like. It's really exciting. It combines the traditional Chipotle experience along with things like digital pick-up, whether it's in-store digital or out-of-store digital, and grab and go. And it also allows for potential new menu items, so really exciting stuff and really preparing ourselves for the next 25 years.\nOperator: Our next question is with Karen Holthouse with Goldman Sachs.\nAnalysts: Another question on the side of things. So with this $50 million of spending on -- really, it's maintenance this year. It sounds like you roll off some of that. That more is onetime than ongoing in nature. Would that rolling off give you sort of more flexibility to then increase the -- or reaccelerate unit growth? Or what's sort of the governing factor on maybe getting back to prior peaks of unit growth?\nExecutives: Yes, I think on a theoretical basis, it could lead to that, but I don't think it's a matter of access to capital because we've got enough access to capital to -- through our operations and through our balance sheet to do the remodels, to do the repairs that Steve talked about. They're bringing our restaurants up to standard. And we can accelerate growth. I think the biggest driver right now is we want to give our ops teams a chance to really get on solid footing. The things that Scott put into place have really just started to take hold. We're going to put a huge emphasis on training, a refocus on training so that we can have confidence that all of our teams, all of our managers, all of our crews will know what our standards are. They can execute these standards, and they'll deliver an excellent guest experience, including great throughput. We haven't had a great throughput year in the last few years, and that takes a lot of training. So I think the new store growth reaccelerating that is going to be much more about how we feel about the ops teams. And are they on a solid footing, our training programs? Are they really taking hold? And then I think would redeploy capital into the new stores. So I wouldn't say just because capital brings up that, that automatically would move in a new store. And we're not commenting specifically on 2019 right now. I think it'd be prudent for us to get through at least half, if not 3 quarters of, 2018. And then we'll assess at that time and talk about what 2019 and beyond looks like for growth.\nOperator: Our final question is with Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays.\nAnalysts: Steve, I believe it was last quarter you talked about the next team, whether it was for menu innovation or new segments and whatnot. I know you talked about how queso was like at their first foray. So I'm just wondering with greater time now under your belt, as you think about that kind of next team, what's the early evolution or thoughts around, I think you mentioned, new segments or new day parts? How would you prioritize the different opportunities that perhaps they're coming up with as you think about the next many years? And I know you just mentioned kind of new menu items. So what do you think kind of the genesis of what's the outcome of that next team in terms of over the next year or so?\nExecutives: Sure. I think the next team's biggest opportunity is to always look at our core menu and make sure that we're cooking better food. We're sourcing better food. We have better ingredients. We're improving our preparation techniques, our cooking techniques, our serving techniques. It's what drove our business for the first couple of decades, taking a core group of menu items and continually improving them, not only through Food with Integrity but through a better restaurant execution. So that's a priority. But additionally, they need to work on new menu items, and they have a whole host of menu items. The new menu items at a place like Chipotle is tricky though. It's tricky not only because we've had the same menu for basically 25 years but because of the linear format. It's not like you can put a whole new thing up on the menu board and -- like at a typical fast food place. Ingredients sort of become part of the overall offering. So it's a tricky proposition, but it's something that we're working really, really hard on. There are exciting new offerings that are around things like salads and different kinds of grains and also an exploration of traditional things, like -- and these are things that customers are asking for, things like nachos and quesadillas. And so how to integrate those into our service format so that we can maintain throughput and sort of the level of execution that we relied on in the past is tricky. So that's something that they're focusing on also.\nAnalysts: Got it. And then, Jack, I just want to clarify. I think you said more than 1/3 of the tax savings, you're going to reinvest. It sounds like a lot of it is more onetime in nature versus ongoing, but did you say something about the remaining 2/3? I thought you said maybe you'd be reinvesting that as well. Or should we assume that the remainder gets returned to shareholders?\nExecutives: Well, in essence, what we did say is that will help us fund the increase in CapEx, but we'll continue, Jeff. We'll continue to generate more than enough capital to support the -- from operations to support our CapEx. We still have a strong balance sheet. So you can expect us to continue to return cash to shareholder not necessarily in incremental amount. I think the incremental amount that we're getting from taxes is going to be funneled into the extra CapEx and to our existing restaurant. We still have room that we can return some of our capital to shareholders as well through buyback.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call over back to Mark Alexee for closing remarks.\nExecutives: Great. Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to sharing our Q1 results with you, which again is planned for Tuesday, April 24. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, thank you for your participation."

         "Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Chipotle Mexican Grill First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Coralie Weather.\nExecutives: Hello, everyone, and welcome to our call today. By now, you should have access to our earnings announcement released this afternoon for the first quarter of 2018. It may also be found on our website at chipotle.com in the Investor Relations section.\nBefore we begin our presentation, I will remind everyone that parts of our discussion today will include forward-looking statements as defined in the securities laws. These forward-looking statements will include statements regarding our strategy and initiative to build sales; sales trends and forecasts for future of comparable restaurant sales, expected new restaurant openings; estimates of future food, labor, occupancy, marketing, other operating and general and administrative cost trends; statements about expected effective tax rate; plans for capital expenditures and stock repurchases as well as other statements of our other expectations and plans.\nThese statements are based on information available to us today, and we are not assuming any obligation to update them. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. We refer you to the Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K as updated in our subsequent Form 10-Qs for discussion of these risks.\nI'd also like to remind everyone that we've adopted a self-imposed quiet period, restricting communications with investors during that period. The quiet period will begin on the 16th day of the last month of each fiscal quarter and continues until the next earnings conference call. For the second quarter of 2018, it will begin June 16 and continue through our second quarter earnings release. \nOur discussion today will also include non-GAAP financial measures, a reconciliation of which can be found on the Presentations page of our Investor Relations section of our website. We will start today's call is with some brief prepared remarks from Brian Niccol, Chief Executive Officer; and Jack Hartung, Chief Financial Officer. We will allow plenty of time at the end of those remarks for questions. In the room and also available during the Q&A period are Scott Boatwright, Chief Restaurant Officer; Chris Brandt, Chief Marketing Officer; Laurie Shallow, Chief communications Officer; and Marissa Andrada, Chief Human Administrations Officer. With that, I will now turn the call over to Brian Niccol.\nExecutives: Thanks, Coralie, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm excited to be talking to you today on my first earnings call with Chipotle. Chipotle is such a strong brand with incredible equity built over the last 25 years, and I couldn't be more excited about our future. One thing is very clear to me: consumers love our great tasting food and appreciate that our food is made with integrity. I have admired Chipotle for many years, and I'm excited to have the opportunity to lead the future direction of this incredible company. \nBefore I get into details of this call, I'd like this part start recognizing Steve Ellis for creating this amazing concept and for the last 25 years, leading it to be coming to the most important restaurant brands over time. I thank Steve foin the invaluable time bringing me up to speed over the past several weeks, and I deeply appreciate him fully handing over the reins to me and giving me the autonomy to lead, innovate and create a new strategy that will ensure our growth for the future. Going forward, Steve has embraced his new role as Executive Chairman. We are fortunate to be able to leverage his creativity and expertise as a culinarian, a visionary and our founder. \nFor those of you who don't know me very well, I'd like to share some of my key beliefs in leadership principles so you know what to expect going forward. I believe it is important to focus on results over activity, to hold people accountable and to be stewards of our business. I believe in the power of innovation and that to be successful, we must create and lead change. I also believe in a winning work ethic and that to win, we need to have an external focus with the ability to quickly read and react to change. And I believe in the power of people so it's important to me that we create a culture that is focused on running and supporting restaurants, putting the customer first, living our purpose, innovating for today and tomorrow and supporting and recognizing each other. \nBefore I share my view on what changes we need to make, I thought I would start by telling you what is not going to change. We will continue to serve high-quality great tasting food that consumers crave. We will also continue to focus on improving operations and fixing and modernizing the foundation of our company. With that said, you will see us doubling down on our purpose and our guest experience. We will get better at innovation and putting customers front and center. We will focus on execution which rests on simple choices, clear goals and consistent measures. We are also upgrading our capabilities to innovate across our business. Specifically, we will provide greater consumer access including through delivery and catering, enhance the digital experience, innovate around our menu and improve our restaurant design. We're working on building a world-class executive team and an organization built for growth. In the last year, we've added new leaders across operations, communications, marketing and human resources. Since our last earnings announcement, we added Chris Brandt as Chief Marketing Officer. And just this week, Marissa Andrada joined Chipotle as Chief Human Resources Officer. Chris Brandt is a seasoned veteran and is quickly assessing the changes we need across marketing so we can get back to emphasizing the creativity of our food and expanding brand loyalty among consumers. Having worked with Chris in the past, I can vouch for his proven track record of delivering innovation that's good for consumers and operations and that provides the financial outcomes needed to gross margins actions and sales. I'm confident Chris will quickly find ways to increase our brand relevance and ensure advertising spend is working harder for us. Marissa Andrada has extensive experience in senior human resource roles and prominent consumer brands, and I'm excited that she has joined our team. Marissa's leadership will be essential as we look to strengthen our organization and ensure we have the right structure and capabilities to achieve our strategy and build a culture of innovation and recognition. We are creating a path to performance, and we're in the process of establishing the strategies to get there. I plan to share more details with you on a special call before our next earnings announcement with more details around how we will do these 5 things: First, grow sales transactions, margin and restaurants; second, elevate our brand relevance and further our brand purpose; third, build the right structure and capabilities to sustain performance; fourth, create a people recognition and innovation culture; and fifth, run great restaurants that deliver best-in-class financial performance. In the coming months, you will see us piloting various tests across key innovation focus areas such as consumer access, the digital experience, our menu and restaurant experience in realigning the organization to support the go-forward strategy. I do want to acknowledge there's a lot of great work underway, and we are starting to get some traction. Curt Garner's work on the mobile app is paying dividends, and I'm excited about the continued benefits of the digitally enhanced second make-line, which is now in 237 restaurants. Order accuracy has improved in those restaurants, leading to a nearly 20% improvement in customer feedback. Digital sales are our fastest growing area with growth of 20% year-over-year and now represent 8.8% of sales in the first quarter. The customer experience with mobile sales is also improving as our average lead time for mobile orders are down by more than half since launching Smarter Pickup Times. Curt and I are excited to continue driving progress in these areas, which we believe will help us bring Chipotle to more people in ways that customers appreciate. \nWe are seeing improvement in operations under Scott Boatwright's leadership. I spent a lot of time in the restaurants with Scott over the last several weeks, and I'm impressed with our teams and our dedication to operational excellence. The plans Scott put in place last fall have created the culture of accountability in the field. Our designs to provide a great guest experience and are building a strong foundation of food safety. Most importantly, our customers are noticing, and I'm confident we are focused on the right measures. We have a lot of work ahead of us, but I'm optimistic about the future of Chipotle. We have a strong economic model, a loyal customer base and a powerful purpose.\nWith that, I look forward to sharing more details with you on the special call I mentioned earlier. Now will turn the call over to to Jack Hartung to provide a financial update.\nExecutives: Thanks, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. we're pleased with the performance in the first quarter as comp sales accelerated slightly, margins expanded and earnings per share grew. And that was a solid quarter. We realize we have much more work ahead. Since Brian's arrival, we've been taking a fresh look at every element of our business. We're committed to running great restaurants, putting our customers first, staying true to our purpose, embracing innovation in menu, digital access in restaurants, improving our execution capabilities and strengthening our culture internally. We're confident that these are the right areas of focus to drive strong performance and increase shareholder value on a sustainable long-term basis. \nBefore I go through the financial results, I want to highlight some important operational accomplishments this quarter. Brian mentioned Scott's plan to instill a culture of accountability is starting to get the attention of our customers as internal customer satisfaction scores have increased significantly since last summer. Employee turnover at the crew level has improved to the best levels we've seen in many years. We have much more to do, but the culture of accountability, the heightened focus in training and the improved leadership structure in the field is beginning to drive results that are precursors to sustained comp sales improvement. Brian highlighted a strong improvement in additional sales, which grew 20% year-over-year and now accounts for 8.8% of total sales. Mobile sales alone grew 41% year-over-year. And these orders are all fulfilled on our second make-line, which we believe to be a competitive advantage and that we will continue to invest in to meet customer experience as convenient as possible, allowing us to continue to grow digital sales. The majority of second make-line orders are app and web orders but also include a party delivery orders and catering. The surge on mobile sales since relaunching our app late last year gives us confidence our customers appreciate great experience. We're proud to say that notified just this week that we won the People's Choice Webby Award for best user interface for mobile app. The Webbies is an award for excellence on the Internet and is one of the most prestigious industry awards. \nCatering is approximately 1% of sales and remains a large untapped opportunity on which we have increased our focus. We recently expanded catering delivery availability to 1,500 restaurants from 940. And on average, we see about a 15% lift in catering sales when we add delivery. And we're decreasing group size minimums, and we're testing lower pricing options to expand our catering reach. Our delivery sales continue to grow at rapid pace. And when our delivery partners offer free delivery Chipotle to build their customer base, our customers respond in a big way as they did during Super Bowl weekend when delivery volumes increased nearly 250%. We'll continue to expand the number delivery partners we work with, and we look to partner with them to offer compelling options to our customers. \nTurning to financial results. We generated revenue of $1.1 billion during the quarter, an increase of 7.4% from last year on comp sales growth of 2.2%. And that's on top of last year's 17% Q1 comp sales. Restaurant level margins for the quarter were 19.5% an improvement of 180 basis points from last year, and earnings per share increased 33% to $2.13. \nThe Q1 comp of 2.2% is comprised of an underlying comp sales growth for the quarter of 2.7%, and that's before the 50 basis point impact from Chiptopia as we lapped deferred revenue from Chiptopia in Q1 of last year. Comp sales are driven by higher average check private, primarily from the price increases in Q1 of last year. The price increase has averaged about 5% across the menu, and resistance has been less than 20%. The check average also benefited from customers adding queso to their order, which added about 200 basis points. \nApril trends have been impacted by unseasonably cold and wintry weather in much of the country as well as the Easter shift. But taking these impacts into account, underlying April comp transaction trends are similar to Q1. Now keep in mind that we started lapping the first price increase from last year April 15, which accounted for about 1% of the sales comp. Based on conference for the first quarter, we are reiterating our full year comp sales guidance in the low single digits with lower sales comps expected in the first half of the year due to tougher comparisons. This guidance does not include any projected impact from the sales growth strategies we're currently developing as it is too early to determine the timing and magnitude of the impact these may have an comps. We opened 35 new restaurants in the quarter and continue to expect 130 to 150 new openings for the full year. We're in early stages of building a pipeline for 2019. And while it's too early to provide specific opening range for 2019, we expect to open at or above 2018 opening levels. We're pleased with the strong performance of our new restaurants this year and will continue to emphasize high-quality, high-returning restaurants as we build out the pipeline. \nFood costs during the quarter were 32.4%., now is down 140 basis points from the 33.8% last year. And that's down from 34.2% in Q4. The decrease from last year was driven by the menu price increase and deficiencies in paper and packaging. We expect relatively stable prices for the rest of 2018 across most items, resulting in food costs at or below the 33% range for the full year. Our full year estimate is higher than the Q1 due to seasonal shift to source avocados from California, which will start in Q2. Labor cost for the quarter were 27.8%, 90 basis points higher than last year. Wage of 5% was offset by the price increase but deleveraged from negative transactions along with the Chiptopia deferral drove the higher labor as a percent of sales. We expect labor costs to improve in a low to mid 27% range in Q2 as we move into our seasonally higher sales months. And we expect labor for the full year to approach 28% as crew and manager merit increases combined with general wage pressures continue to outpace the comp. Occupancy cost for the quarter was 7.4% or flat with last year, and we expect full year to be in a similar range. Other operating costs were 12.9% of sales, down from 14.1% last year. Our marketing and promo costs were only 1.8% in the quarter, which is a decrease of about 150 basis points compared to last year. We still anticipate marketing and promo costs to be right around 3% of sales for the full year with elevated spending for the remainder of the year. And while Chris and the marketing team are still working on a plan for Q2 and the rest of the year, we would expect marketing will be in the 3.5% to 4% range in Q2. \nOther operating costs include about 30 basis points of incremental maintenance and repair costs that we discussed on the last call, and we expect to have them continue at this elevated level during 2018. G&A for the quarter was $77 million or 6.7% of sales, an increase from 6.5% last year. This was lower than expected due to stock comp forfeitures of around $4 million and the 2018 equity grant that was done very late in the quarter. With normalized stock comp in Q2, total G&A is expected to be around $7 million higher, around $84 million. And that run rate puts us on target to hit the $330 million G&A for the full year, which was communicated last quarter. Underlying G&A in the quarter increased $8 million compared to last year to support our growth as well as several initiatives including new formalized training program and operational changes in the field. This increase comes after 3 years of flat G&A despite opening up 650 restaurants. As we fully develop our strategic plans, we strengthen our unit economics and drive sustainable sales growth. We may need to adjust how and where we invest our G&A. As such, these G&A estimates for the second quarter and the full year is subject to change and will update you on any known changes on the special investor call Brian mentioned earlier. \nDepreciation was 4.1% of sales for the quarter, an increase from 3.7% last year. We expect depreciation to remain at about 4% for several quarters as we accelerate depreciation for items expected to be replaced related to the maintenance and repair refresh as well as other capital initiatives that in the last call. Our pretax income was $94.2 million, and our effective tax rate for the quarter was 36.9%. I'd like to spend a few more minutes I normally would on the tax rate to put it in the right context. First of all, the actual tax rate expect to pay the government is around 28%, not 36.9%. This tax rate of 36.9% includes about 810 basis points, the bulk of which are noneconomic accounting items related to stock compensation issued in previous years. In essence, during the quarter, we wrote off deferred tax assets related to previously issued stock comp because the related performance shares either did not vest until they expired or this year is vested at a much lower value. So the related deferred tax asset on our balance sheet needed to be written off or written down and the write-off flows through the tax expense line. We expect no such write-off in Q2 and Q3 so our effective tax rate is expected to be around 28.8% in those quarters. During the fourth quarter, additional performance shares may expire. And if they do, we'll write off the related deferred tax assets for those awards. Again, we'll not actually pay a higher tax rate, but the write-off will flow through the tax line. We expect the tax rate including this write-off in Q4 will be around 38.4%. Before I lead the discussion on taxes, I want to briefly walk through the components of our underlying tax rate. There are 5 key components to the underlying rate. First, our federal tax rate is statutory 21%. Second, our estate tax rate is about 5.6%, and it's higher than last year's rate because of the lower federal rate. It takes our rates to 26.6%. Third, we lost part of the deduction for free meals to get to our restaurant teams, which adds 1.3% to the rate, and it takes us to 27.9%. Fourth, about 1.6% is added related to the tax law change where all named executive officer compensation over $1 million is not deductible. And fifth, our rate is reduced by about 60 basis points for employer wage products and other miscellaneous items. And that gets us to the 28.8% I mentioned earlier. For the full year taken taken into new account, I'll take all these new accounts and adding about 4% on an annual basis for the noneconomic write-off of deferred tax items I talked about earlier, we estimate that the 2018 effective full year tax rate will be around 33%. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet and ended the quarter with $580 million in cash and investments. We generated $200 million in cash from operations. During the first quarter, we repurchased 68 million of our stock an average price of $311 per share, and we spent $58 million on capital investments outlined on the previous call. We still expect opportunistically to purchase -- repurchase shares throughout the year, invest in that capital items to discuss and maintain a cash investment balance of about $500 million. Is a mention in the last earnings call, the overall guidance we provided then and we're iterating today does not factor in any potential strategic changes arising from hiring a new CEO. As Brian mentioned earlier, we will need to realign the organization in order to support and execute our updated strategy. We also plan to carefully analyze underperforming assets during the second quarter. \nThis organizational review and the asset review will likely entail some onetime costs in 2018 that are too early to quantify. But these initiatives are intended to support and strengthen our economic model and settles up to execute her strategic plan and delivered long-term shareholder value. We'll share more details with you later this quarter. We're encouraged by our first quarter results, and we're optimistic about the direction we're headed. We're confident that the changes we're making to our leadership and the realignment of our organization we'll enable us to be more and amble and more innovative in all areas: customer access, digital menu and the restaurant environment. And then we'll allow us to execute better to deliver in our commitments to our guests, our employees and our shareholders. We look forward to sharing more details about our plan at the special investor call, which will be scheduled sometime before our Q2 earnings call. Operator, we'll now open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Nicole Miller from Piper Jaffray.\nAnalysts: Jack, a quick one for you. Did you really CapEx going particular, the numbers I just wanted to check that. I wanted to check that real quick and then ask Brian a quick question.\nExecutives: The CapEx right now we expect will be the same it was outlined on the last call. It's going to be in the neighborhood of $300 million. About 1/3 of that is new stores. The other 2/3 is existing stores. The big items there is the refresh we talked about, which is about $50 million. Another big piece was about $25 million for the digitized second make line, and then there's another number of other things that we outlined in the last call, but those are still intact now. Nicole, just like I mentioned, our guidance hasn't taken into account the impact of strategy. It's possible that we may refine that or will give you full recap on any changes we'll talk to you before the next earnings call.\nAnalysts: And then Brian, just a big picture question for you, and thanks for your time. Do you see this as a recovery story global growth opportunity? Just curious how to see how you see this playing out long term. And you talked about 5 pieces you want to execute. Can you give us any little detail before the next call on maybe some of the low hanging fruit versus longer-term solutions?\nExecutives: Yes. Sure, Nicole. First, I think the opportunity is clearly a recovery story in the U.S. and will be focused on chasing what I believe is a powerful brand that has really strong economics, strong purpose that when we tie the elements that I outlined in my earlier comments and we'll go into much further detail on our special call, I think the opportunity is really exciting for what this brand has in front of it. The innovation will be across the business, as I mentioned, in access, digital, menu and frankly, we'll double down our fundamentals. So I think the story of recovery, and where that recovery takes us, I think, is also really exciting, but that's much longer-term discussion.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Tarantino from Robert W. Baird & Company.\nAnalysts: Brian, just a couple of questions kind of high-level, how you're thinking about how this plays out over the next 2 years. Are you thinking I guess directionally that you're going to need to make a lot of investments in the business? I know you talked about realigning the structure, but do you think there's going to be a big step-up in expenses related to that? And then secondly, I know Jack mentioned next year you opened a similar number of units or maybe a little higher, but how are you thinking about unit growth as you execute this turnaround strategy? Do you think you need to slow or moderate the unit growth in the out years to accomplish what you envisioned?\nExecutives: Your first question, I think we can get into all the details of how we see the plan playing out forward. I think some of the good news is though, as I look into the business like a great area of focus that people can ask me about this are marketing spend. I think the marketing spend is one of those areas that you believe there's a lot of opportunity to take those dollars that we're currently allocating and make the brand much more visible with what we have. And then we're going to put in place more of a test and learn approach on the initiatives that we'll roll out. So we'll have clarity on what we believe the return is for the investment that we're making before we make those decisions to go beyond our current plans. So I think the recovery plan that we'll be putting in place or as I talked about earlier, our path to performance will be based on leveraging the idea of testing and proving out propositions while at the same token with our organization, rebuild capability and restructure to support the strategy that I believe will set us up for growth in the near term and longer term. Your second question regarding units, the good news is the economics of the units that we're opening continue to look very strong. And as mentioned in the script, we see no reason for us to change the pace that we are experiencing this year. And obviously, as we to get further further into our plan, we'll give updates as the time permits when it's right to do that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore from AllianceBernstein.\nAnalysts: Congratulations, Brian, on the new role. I wanted to ask you if I may, one is about the quarter that just passed and then now sort of going forward. So in terms of the quarter that just passed, I guess I'm surprised that it appears to be a fairly quick impact you might be having. A couple of things that you've seen or maybe new creative around marketing and then a waste management initiative that looks like it has some pretty big opportunities in terms of in-restaurant waste management. So I guess from my perspective, to what extent is this you, Brian, kind of putting your stamp already on that? And do you see a lot of low hanging fruit like what some of these initiatives seem to suggest just in terms of sort of basic systematic approaches? That was question one and then question 2 if you could just talk a little bit about what you meant by consumer meaningful innovation across the business in the context of what's always been a very simple, straightforward menu and the operations that go with that.\nExecutives: Yes. Sure. So first, obviously, thank you for the kind words. Very excited to be in the CEO role of Chipotle. It's loaded with opportunity, which I think is what you're asking about. And what I'll tell you is in the short term, I think there are real opportunities for us to make simple pivots to increase, I think the appeal of our brand to those customers that are already very much big fans. One of the big surprises for me, frankly,  even once it got announced that I was taking this role is the amount of people who reached out to say how much they love Chipotle and they love the food and I think just with the most recent advertising, we made a little pivot towards reminding people what is great about the ingredients. This Food with Integrity purpose really resonates and reminding people why they feel good about eating Chipotle, I think, is always a good approach. So you continue to see us make simple pivots like that while we also continue to push this brand forward in a big way from the standpoint of access as it relates to digital innovation, menu as it relates to menu innovation that leverages our operating model, which I believe is something very special in this industry. And it allows us to do a lot of exciting things, whether it's dayparts or simple menu tweaks that I think will broaden the appeal. And then, obviously, I think you're kind of mentioning your question about waste management and such. Look, there's always opportunity to be better on the cost side, and we're going to continue to look for those opportunities along the way because that's just frees up the ability to give the customer more and more what they want and our team members better experience to provide the experience you want them to provide. So lots of opportunities I think in the short term. We're going to be very cognizant of what are the things we in the sequence in the near term and whether the things we put into test to ensure we're focusing on the right things over the next 18 to 24 months.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia from William Blair.\nAnalysts: Jack, quick question on the restaurant-level margin. I know you beat in the first quarter. I think some of that, as you mentioned with good marketing, will catch up as the year goes on. Are you still looking for 17.5 to 18.5 for the year? And then longer term, I guess with Brian with your leadership, I mean how do you think about the long-term restaurant-level margin at Chipotle as you talk about new dayparts balancing sales versus margin?\nExecutives: On the margin range, we had a very nice quarter. It was aided by lower marketing. The good news is, Brian and Chris to the extent they came in and we're able to look at what marketing was doing, they were able to redirect dollar so they weren't spend. And so that's kind of dry powder. So that's dry powder that we have for future quarters. I think that's a very good thing. I would say the range is 17.5 to 18.5 now appears quite conservative. I don't know that I would change it. I think what I'd do is we're going to probably hit for the year at the high end of that. Could we beat it slightly? Sure. I just wouldn't want to call it a victory just yet. But I think getting out in the gates is strong to show that we have some great margin potential. And then you wanted to know the margin potential going forward. If you want general margin potential, Sharon, I can answer that. I still think that our margin are going to be highly contingent to volume. Like, for example, if we're in this 18.5% to 19% or so for this year, if we get up to $2.2 million volume, we can do a 22% margin. If we get a $2.4 million, we can get to 24% margin. So really, the biggest lever to pull is bringing more customers in. And we bring more customers in, we know that our model numbers lever up pretty significantly.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Glass from Morgan Stanley.\nAnalysts: Brian, good to hear your voice again. Congratulations. Two questions. One is when you look at the brand and you've looked at it from afar, and now you're looking at it from the inside? How do you think about the price-value relationship in this business versus when you came from? Is there an opportunity to broaden the price-value relationships can capture more customers? Or are you happy with thinking about that price-value equation for the brand going forward? And then maybe just secondly in your mind what's the writing for us to look at your initiatives that you're contemplating and how they're going to play out. Is this the year of investment and the impact is really felt in '19? Or do you think there can be some meaningful impact changes inside of 2018.\nExecutives: Yes. Here's what I would tell you is the value proposition Chipotle is tremendously strong. Now that said, we will always be looking for innovation that continues to enhance that value proposition. The most important thing I think you can do for a healthy value proposition is you should never get complacent on where you stand. So we will be on the side of the consumer making sure that we give them the value proposition that excites them to come back over and over again. So all these initiatives we'll be talking about, one of the ways to make sure it's consumer relevant is it rings the bell for customer on that value proposition, whether that value proposition takes place in mobile, digital, loyalty, menu, access, those are all important things. So that's the one piece. Your second question about time line, look. Here's what I would tell you is as opportunities present themselves, we will walk through those opportunities to grow the business. As we find opportunities that yield even bigger benefits, testing and learning and iterating. Those things will take place a little bit longer, but I think there are simple wins on our way to our path to what they think is going to be really accelerated opportunities in the future. So that's how I think about it. It's really a combination of both. We'll find some singles on the way to find home runs.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Karen Holthouse with Goldman Sachs.\nAnalysts: So obviously, looking forward to the call that we're going to get in a month or 2 months with some  more details on this. But thinking about that call, is that something that's really going to be focused on where their opportunities at the margin level or to drive sales or should we be also thinking about going to be discussion of any more structural changes, whether that's the balance sheet is refranchising something that you're considering how should we think about kind of what's on the table or topic for a discussion there?\nExecutives: Yes. What I'm going to tell is we're going to use that special call to give clarity even further into the strategy, the structure necessary to execute that strategy and what those key focus areas are to put Chipotle on the path to performance that we believe is highly attainable. So it will be comprehensive, and I think you'll find it it will be choiceful. And I think there is power in simplicity, power in choice and power in a focused organization. So obviously, it will be a comprehensive discussion and the good news is we'll have our entire leadership team present to be able to really discuss our path forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays.\nAnalysts: Congratulations again, Brian. Two things. One, just on the comp recovery, maybe from an outsider actually most recently a competitor's perspective and just wondering in your view what you think has been the greatest impediment to the Chipotle recovery over the past couple of years, hence, I guess which of these initiatives you're talking about will be the most impactful, I guess, is a different way to look at it into. The second question which is the fact that you came from Taco Bell, which obviously left the laterals, but the one thing that's quite different is Taco Bell being close to 100% franchise models. Now you're  100% company operated model. Just wondering qualitatively how does the approach differ when you look at frozen cons the franchising versus the company operated site just wondering how you have to think about things differently from that perspective.\nExecutives: So I think to answer your first question, Chipotle, smartly, under Scott Boatwright's leadership has refocused the fundamentals in running these restaurants. We put clarity into roles. We put focus on throughput, and we've also put high expectations on the guest experience and the food experience we're going to provide. Those fundamentals are critical whether you own the restaurants or whether you franchise them to people so there really is no trade-off in what are the fundamentals to having a great restaurant? The only thing that I think Scott has done very well is he put a culture of accountability in the culture that people know they can count on each other to train, support and grow. And I think that is a foundational element for any upside that we will experience in this business. We can never lose sight on running great restaurants and having great people that restaurants and supporting them with a wonderful culture and tremendous opportunities. So that's the first piece. The second piece is I think the brand has been invisible. So I think if you combine great fundamentals in the restaurant would now a visible brand that has a powerful purpose and really credible food. It's a recipe for a lot of opportunity that can play well in the way the customers want to eat food today and I believe how they want to eat food in the future. So I'm tremendously excited about the fundamentals that we are maniacally focused on coupled with identifying how we make this brand much more visible and get a narrative back out there on explaining what makes our brand different, what makes our brand connect with people, feel good about the way they eat and whether you can feel great about carrying that into them. And I think you had a question on franchising? We see no need to go down that path right now, given the economic model that we have and the returns that we get with building new restaurants so -- but thanks for the question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer & Co.\nAnalysts: Congratulations, Brian, as well from me. I have 2 questions for you guys both on higher thinking about the asset base. We actually talked about an asset base review. First of all, is there an additional test you're doing on the unit economic threshold required to earn the right to stay in the asset base that you can talk to us about? And then Brian, you talked about looking at your unit base in improving the accessibility of it. Could the implementation of drive-throughs play a role in the accessibility strategy, where it makes sense? Or is accessibility really just focused solely on digital? And I ask that question just in the spirit of where you came from, obviously seeing the benefits of drive-throughs.\nExecutives: I'll address the first question on the asset base. We haven't changed our threshold for a high-return asset. What we're looking though is we had a number of restaurants that booked before the drop in sales or strong cash flows, strong returning stores. We opened a number of restaurants during a tough period where they got off to a slow start so our asset review is going to look at all the restaurants clear underperformers, and these will be negative cash flow stores. We're not looking at positive cash flow that the return is a little underperforming. We'll going to look at stores or restaurants that are not cash flowing that maybe we picked the wrong side, maybe we got off to a wrong start and it's going to be difficult, if not impossible, to change that. And to give you an order of magnitude and the review of while we're still in the middle of it. We're looking at something less than 100 restaurants so it's not a huge list of restaurants but that's kind of the total population that we're looking at. We'll review each and every one of them, and we'll look at the whole story from a financial standpoint, from a real estate standpoint, from what kind of first impression do we make. And then we'd make some careful choices about what to do with the assets.\nExecutives: It's Brian. Your second question with regard to access, I think innovation in access, obviously, you are not surprised by the idea that looks digital whether it's through the mobile access, delivery as access, also kiosk as access, catering as access, I mean I love the list that I'm rattling off here. The trick for us is figuring out what comes first and how we prioritize it accordingly. Now drive-throughs, I think, are an interesting proposition for Chipotle as an element. It will be something that will definitely part of our access innovation program, but that's in the scheme of what's going to happen in the very near term versus what's more of a longer-term access innovation will fall further on that longer-term scale.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Matt McGinley from Evercore ISI.\nAnalysts: First question is on the -- for Jack, first, you guided in February on the restaurant margin is you came in about 3 to 3.5 points better than expected. And we can see what's going to happen over the course of the year with the COGS and labor expense, but a lot of that came from other operating expenses in this quarter. And I know that 150 bps was related to the ad spend shifts. I'm curious what else in that line item would look better over the course of the year. Is that just not doing maintenance? Is there something else that is just looking better than you anticipated in that line item?\nExecutives: The food costs behave really well. Avocados were something that took out of the margins last year. They got better later in the fourth quarter, and then they got better again you're the stock about avocados almost every year. It has a big impact when it goes up and down. Nearly 50% of our transactions include guacamole. And so when prices shoot up, which by the way, they shot up something below $30 a case to nearly $80 a case for part of the fourth quarter. So they've come back to kind of normal prices. If they stay at normal prices, we should have a decent food cost during the year. Labor is kind of the same story in terms of which inflation continues. We expect them to continue so the guidance I give you, I think, is very reasonable guidance. So I think we got off to a great start. I think the comments that Brian made about Scott and our field team did a great job of managing food cost to the extent that it was their job to order the right amount of food and control food waste and things like that. They did a great job to manage labor as well. So I think we're off to a great start I think if you keep these control the next big surprise or additional sales. And so some of the things that Brian mentioned go into test, and they test well. And they put those in a more restaurant and get more sales. We know we have the ability to leverage our margin we bring more customers in, and that would be the next report.\nAnalysts: Brian, I've heard a lot really from external people that when you look at the supply chain that Chipotle has versus other restaurant chains that just the way the food is prepped and the way it's that supply chain, it makes it harder to innovate Chipotle versus other chains. Having been to other restaurant chains, do you feel that there's a big factor that sort of limits your innovation at that company? Or do you see this as kind of greenfield and there's a lot that you can do?\nExecutives: Look, I actually think the -- I'll break up your comment. I guess supply chain, meaning the ingredients that we use, I see no barrier to innovation. If anything, I'd see this great ingredients to be able to further distance ourselves from other restaurant alternatives. And then from a standpoint of finishing that ingredient in the restaurant, it is a really powerful model. I mean if there's one thing I'm really impressed by is the throughput capability of this line is something really special and unique. And I actually think it's an advantage to figure out how to do innovation that can build from a throughput machine. I don't think there are many places where you can say, \"Well, I can have that great food done at that speed and then we can innovate on that foundation or that platform.\" And then you'll see when we're talking about some of the innovations we're talking about, it just takes advantage of what I believe is a competitive advantage. So I think we're going to be able to innovate and distance ourselves and really put ourselves into what I believe is something very special that will customers and give our team members the ability to execute flawlessly.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andy Barish from Jeffries.\nAnalysts: I was wondering on that. Actually, follow-up on a couple of those comments if there is some throughput data you're willing to share kind of currently versus a year ago. And then secondly, on innovation, not only supply chain but just the physical plant and now the need for second make-lines. Is the space constraints make it more difficult to innovate? Or is that sort of outmoded thought and there's ways to work around that with your fresh eyes being the business now?\nExecutives: Because the second make-line is actually a huge enabler for our business to take throughput to the next level, frankly. And the reason is we put digital capability into 250-plus restaurants, but the fact that we already have the second make-line physically there in all our restaurants is a huge opportunity for us to both innovate as well as drive throughput even further on our consumer-facing line as well as our second make-line. The second make-line has some efficiencies that we are delighted that we have in place because as we dial up the innovation in digital and we dial up the on-premise access, it presents a great opportunity for us to really enhance our throughput on both fronts.\nAnalysts: And then any throughput numbers you're willing to share or a little early for that?\nExecutives: We can plug you into those details, Scott, will be available as part of the special call we're going to do. And we're happy to take you through that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe from JPMorgan.\nAnalysts: Brian, I talked about how you guys put in the fourth meal or so-called late-night daypart as well as breakfast. You mentioned daypart a couple of different times and I was wondering what that could potentially mean at Chipotle whether it's different products, different times of the day, which can happen certainly within quick service or fast cas type of format and whether it's possible to have breakfast without drive through or maybe you could put just the dense urban stores while not necessarily putting them in suburbs Just thinking about what kind of potential your dayparts in each of the brand at this point.\nExecutives: Yes, sure. I think one of the things it's really excited about the daypart opportunity for Chipotle is today, we're opening at 10:30, 10:45, and we're closing roughly around 10:00 p.m. And there's opportunities to expand those hours and leverage our existing food and our existing platform in a very seamless fashion. Then when you look at the obvious dayparts within those extended hours, and you quickly see where this opportunity so we have some downtime where frankly I think with some marketing and some product innovation, we could turn those downtimes into transaction driving times. So as I think about that right now, there is daypart expansion opportunity with our current model, and you layer on some menu innovation coupled with some marketing communication, I see a real ability to drive the existing platform in those dayparts without having to take the step today all the way to breakfast introducing a whole new food platform. So that's where our thinking is today, not to say that in the future you may not even expand those hours further, and you need to think about new food platforms but that's not in the plan right now.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Palmer from RBC Capital Markets.\nAnalysts: Brian, first, a question on consumer scores i.e. you mentioned something about becoming more consumer-centric. What is the consumer telling you about Chipotle today and the opportunities to improve perhaps in ways that you see in the brand deteriorated in those scores and just in ways that you just feel like it's underachieving. And just separately, just building on that last thing that you mentioned, the operating model, everyone's always assumed that Chipotle's operating model because you have this limited number of wells in front of us and doesn't have the ability to handle new menu news or even use price because of that simple menu, and those are 2 tools that you use with great effect in the past. And so I think people are having a hard time understanding how you're going to use those going forward. So that comment will be helpful as well.\nExecutives: Sure. So on your first question regarding the consumer, what we see as a real opportunity to make the brand more visible to be more top of mind with people to remind them why they love Chipotle. When you remind people about the fact that they buy into this idea of food integrity, cultivating a better world, they instantly feel better about the food they are eating. And we make good in that promise. So I think there's a real opportunity to be more visible and how you want to be connected to this brand, why you believe in this brand. And based on the information I'm seeing, that resonates with how people want to eat today and how they will want to eat in the future. Look, there is also huge opportunities to get people access. One of their biggest complaints, frankly, is access to brand. The brand is not that convenient. I know we have 2,400 stores, almost 25,000 stores. We, as a result, might not be convenient to people. So you got people to say can I do mobile ordering, when can I do delivery when can I get Chipotle to me. And the good news is I think 50% people don't even realize we started to do this thing. So there is tremendous opportunity of anything educating people on why they should feel good about the brand, why would they will love the food because it gives them all the customization, the abundance that are looking for with the ingredients that they want, and then you combine that without giving more access and getting food to them under terms. It's really exciting proposition. Your second question on our ability to innovate, the line has flexibility so long as we first test and understand the demand that we're going to generate. If we prepare ourselves for what is going to happen, Scott and his operators will be capable to use our supply chain and our operating model to execute and meet consumers' expectations. Where you run into problems is when you get ahead of the forecast. And one of the things we're going to put in place is when we are working on innovation, we're going to pilot that innovation so that you can have a prediction of what's going to happen and prepare the operating model accordingly to support it. So I'm very optimistic about opportunities that just leverage getting more access to what Chipotle is today, and then you add some innovation, and I think you broaden the appeal, and we have predictability that's going to perform. Scott and the operators will be able to execute.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Gregory Francfort from Bank of America.\nAnalysts: I have 2 questions. The first for Brian, have you looked at portion sizing and your thoughts on whether or not consumers are paying you for your portion sizes now or if there's an opportunity to take that up or down? And I think you also talked about employee turnover coming down recently. Any metrics around that? And what do you think is driving that? Have you made any changes on the training front? Or the industry has been going up so that will be kind of impressive, I guess I'm wondering what you guys are doing differently.\nExecutives: Sure. The piece on employee turnover, I think that's a testament to Scott putting clarity of what you're supposed to be doing in your role, how you support each other in the restaurant and providing clarity of how you can grow in this organization. And people like to stay in places where they believe they are appreciated and they have the opportunity to grow. And that's the culture that we're putting in the restaurant, and I think that's why you're seeing our turnover move down. And it's really exciting because the more we can push the turnover down, the more you know finds ourselves to change the organization and execute better. It's that simple. So Marissa who's new to the team, she's going to be laser focused on how we drive this culture in training all the way through the restaurant while Scott partners with her to take from a culture of accountability to also a culture of growth. And I think if you put those 2 things together, you will feel highly appreciated and believe there's future for them at Chipotle. What was your first question?\nExecutives: The first question was just on portion sizing. Yes, yes. So one of the things clearly that people love about Chipotle is the customization proposition, and we're going to continue to figure out how we can be more consistent in our execution for people so that they don't feel like they got too much this time or they got too little. So one of the things that I love about the experiences the consumer knows is we're a place that wants to give them the experience that they're after with their food. And that's not going to change. So if people want to a little more, we'll give them a little more. If they want a little less, we'll give them a little less. But regardless, whether they're asking for a little more or a little less, one of the things Scott is focused on is how do you continue to get more consistent so people feel like they're getting the experience they got the last time as well as the experience they can count on for the next time. So that's how we're focused on is how do we get more consistent with that experience but we're never going to tell the consumer you can ask us or a little more or a little less.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Charles from Cowen and Company.\nAnalysts: Brian, congrats again on your new role. Longer-term question for Brian and shorter one for Jack. Brian, as you think about the road ahead, can you help us compare and contrast the starting points when you look at Taco Bell in 2011 and Chipotle in 2017, what do you think of the different factors at play here that help shape the turnaround, if you will? And then Jack, you mentioned as well as some more comp trends that continued in April, how are you framing that, just looking at, you mentioned, 3 year? Or how should you think about that perhaps just for simplicity, if you just disclose the number, it might be helpful.\nExecutives: Why don't I go first and hand it over to you, Jack. Here's what I believe for Chipotle. I believe the brand has been invisible. And I think as the brand becomes visible and we lead culture, that's going to be a huge opportunity going forward. This brand needs to be leading culture, not reacting to it. And the people that are loyal to this brand, that's what they want to be a part of. The other piece that's very exciting about this company is there's limited innovation happening in small scale, and the opportunity for us is how we take some of that invasion to pilot it and get it to a place we can now do it at scale and the opportunity to talk about a few of them, they go from access to visual to menu, even the restaurant design opportunities going forward. That is huge opportunity. A brand that has a lot of relevance that's culturally right, coupled with innovation, built on strong fundamentals that give people great food at a fast experience at a great value, I'll like the future. I really get excited about that because of those are things that I think as you put together this leadership team here with Chris and Scott and Risa and Jack and Curt and Lori, it is mission 1 to make this brand visible. And right next to it is be culturally relevant. So all the innovation and the fundamentals that we put in place are going to attract people not only to work here but attract people to continue to be our loyal customers. And that's why I will tell you about the long term.\nExecutives: And in terms of what I look when I made the comments about April in terms of quarter expectations or based on what we expect with the Easter shift, what normal seasonality would bring, and weather definitely hit us during parts of the month. I'm sure that's not a surprise to you. From a comp standpoint, we look at it mainly from a 1 year comp standpoint. And multiple years, you have to go back to 3. A 2-year trend will not give you anything meaningful. '16 and '17 lined up. '16 was a step down. '17 was a step up. So if you wanted to do a 3-year layer, you're probably get in the same ballpark. But for purposes of what we did, we just kept it very, very simple April compared to where our previous trends. And underneath it all, it looks like the trends were very similar when you factor the weather out.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Will Slabaugh from Stephens Inc.\nAnalysts: On the 5% pricing and then maybe more specifically on longer-term pricing plans, in general, I realize it's been a while since Chipotle taken meaningful pricing, but 5%, obviously, a decent way to head to where the rest of the industry is. I'm curious, number one, if you plan to change the strategy to be more consistent in terms of low price increases; and number two, if you see any material difference in customer pushback to the pricing. In some of markets that we've talked, it's being lower performing markets in recent years or if that 20% level that you talked about earlier has been fairly consistent?\nExecutives: Yes. Every 3-year pricing -- we've done it kind of 3 times in a row now, it's not necessarily strategy that we say, \"Okay, no more price increases for the next 3 years.\" It just kind of happened. This past time, we didn't want to do it trying to bring customers back into the restaurant. Before that, labor was very tame, and so we had strong comps so we can lever our margin without resorting to pricing. It's a powerful event to have if you can continue to build your model, continue to expand leverage without constantly increasing menu prices, and so we took advantage of that luxury. Going forward, we're going to do what we need to do. And if that means doing smaller more regular price increases, we're certainly open to that. If we can lever our model, if we get the top line going and we lever the model without a price increase, we think we can drive greater value to the customer. Customers always love it when get greater value. We're not going to predetermine what and when we will do anything with pricing, but we're open to doing something other than a 3-year cadence. In terms of the resistance, we just don't see much resistance across the company. The only time we've seen it and we've seen it in the past as well, we see it a bit on the West Coast, and that's it. Otherwise our customers think we provide a great value, and value is not just based on price. It's based on high-quality ingredients. It's based on a lot of food. It's based on an environment that they enjoy, and it's actually the value that we bring is a harder thing to bring based on food, based on the environment, based on the overall experience. Price is something that our consumers sure they like to play who wouldn't. But when they come to Chipotle and they get the right experience in a nice restaurant, they call that a great value.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris O'Cull from Stephens.\nAnalysts: For Jack, I apologize if I missed it, but what was the traffic decline in the quarter? And then secondly, Brian, several of the opportunities to improve access for the brand seemed to -- could take some time to build, but are there opportunities to quickly address the traffic declines you're seeing?\nExecutives: I'll answer around the traffic. The comp came from an increase in average check, and you can take the 5% price increase. It's less than 20% but just rounded up to 20% for queso added to, so you can back into the transaction impact was so it'll be at the 3.3% or so range, 3 3, 3 5 something like that, so that's the underlying traffic.\nExecutives: And then to answer your question on what was my belief on the transaction opportunity going forward, I think that's a real opportunity and one of the things that Chris and the marketing organization are going to be centered on. And the good news is I believe the combination of the brand visibility, the innovation that i talked about, I think there are opportunities in the near term that we can start putting into place, putting into action that make it a material impact on our transactions. And then over time, you'll see the culmination of all these things coming together, I think, play even bigger impact on the transactions and the number of people coming to our restaurants. So it's really a combination of the digital, the menu, the access, programs like loyalty. Those are all things that are going to be centered on making sure we are driving transactions as part of the proposition.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Strelzik from BMO Capital Markets.\nAnalysts: Over the last couple of years, there's been a shifting focus at different points in time trying to bring back sales among existing customers at some points, finding new customers at some point. I'm just wondering, Brian, do you think about the opportunities in that way, the customer base in that way? And if so, where do you see the greatest opportunities over the next 6, 12, 24 months?\nExecutives: Look, here's what you know about our customers. Every age cohort loves Chipotle, okay? And we overindex with young people. And this brand is a youthful spirit. It's a challenger, right? It's breaking convention of what accessible food done fast is. And that appeals broadly. So our goal is not to be exclusive. Our goal is to be inclusive, and our goal is to drive transactions with a youthful spirit, meaningful positioning and continue to leverage the strength of being a youthful brand that connects with youth. So that's how I look at it. Obviously, Chris and I are digging deep into it because we need to understand the reasons why you either slow down or increase your usage with us. And then we want to make sure we understand why all these different age cohorts are excited about being in the Chipotle business. Our goal is every category buyer come in Chipotle. That's simple. We probably won't get all of them in the near term, but I'm going to try in the long term.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brett Levy from Deutsche Bank.\nAnalysts: If you could share a little bit, Jack, this question is for you on the margins. You mentioned that you think you can get to the high end of the 17.5, 18.5 range, and then you said you could probably exceed it see it. But you also mentioned earlier that nothing is really being built into the plan with respect to what Brian's integration can happen. Can you just balance between what you were saying? Because it sounded like you said it's going to be without any implementation of Brian's strategies, but it also sounded like you were talking about additional sales.\nExecutives: I think you heard it right. We reiterated our guidance that comps would be in the low single digits so the margin comments deal with that assumption. To the extent we have strategies that go through pilot and are worthy of a rollout, meaning we expect to have a return after investment, that's not included in the comp. It's too early to know what those things might be or what the magnitude might be so this is kind of a base case, if you will.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session, and I would like to turn the call over to Coralie for closing remarks.\nExecutives: Thank you for joining us today. We look for to speaking with you again in our special call in late Q2. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.\nOperator: Greetings, and welcome to the Chipotle Mexican Grill First Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Coralie Witter.\nExecutives: Hello, everyone, and welcome to our call today. By now, you should have access to our earnings announcement released this afternoon for the first quarter of 2018. It may also be found on our website at chipotle.com in the Investor Relations section.\nBefore we begin our presentation, I will remind everyone that parts of our discussion today will include forward-looking statements as defined in the securities laws.

We refer you to the Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K as updated in our subsequent Form 10-Qs for discussion of these risks.\nI'd also like to remind everyone that we've adopted a self-imposed quiet period, restricting communications with investors during that period. The quiet period will begin on the 16th day of the last month of each fiscal quarter and continues until the next earnings conference call. For the second quarter of 2018, it will begin June 16 and continue through our second quarter earnings release. \nOur discussion today will also include non-GAAP financial measures, a reconciliation of which can be found on the Presentations page of the Investor Relations section of our website. We will start today's call with some brief prepared remarks from Brian Niccol, Chief Executive Officer; and Jack Hartung, Chief Financial Officer. We will allow plenty of time at the end of those remarks for questions. In the room and also available during the Q&A period are Scott Boatwright, Chief Restaurant Officer; Chris Brandt, Chief Marketing Officer; Laurie Schalow, Chief communications Officer; and Marissa Andrada, Chief Human Administrations Officer. \nWith that, I will now turn the call over to Brian Niccol.\nExecutives: Thanks, Coralie, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm excited to be talking to you today on my first earnings call with Chipotle. Chipotle is such a strong brand with incredible equity built over the last 25 years, and I couldn't be more excited about our future. One thing is very clear to me: consumers love our great-tasting food and appreciate that our food is made with integrity. I have admired Chipotle for many years, and I'm excited to have the opportunity to lead the future direction of this incredible company. \nBefore I get into details of this call, I'd like to start by recognizing Steve Ells for creating this amazing concept and for the last 25 years, leading it to becoming one of the most important restaurant brands of our time. I thank Steve for the invaluable time he's spent bringing me up to speed over the past several weeks, and I deeply appreciated him fully handing over the reins to me and giving me the autonomy to lead, innovate and create a new strategy that will ensure our growth for the future. Going forward, Steve has embraced his new role as Executive Chairman. We are fortunate to be able to leverage his creativity and expertise as a culinarian, a visionary and our founder. \nFor those of you who don't know me very well, I'd like to share some of my key beliefs in leadership principles so you know what to expect going forward. I believe it is important to focus on results over activity, to hold people accountable and to be stewards of our business. I believe in the power of innovation and that to be successful, we must create and lead change. I also believe in a winning work ethic and that to win, we need to have an external focus with the ability to quickly read and react to change. And I believe in the power of people so it's important to me that we create a culture that is focused on running and supporting great restaurants, putting the customer first, living our purpose, innovating for today and tomorrow and supporting and recognizing each other. \nBefore I share my view on what changes we need to make, I thought I would start by telling you what is not going to change. We will continue to serve high-quality great-tasting food that consumers crave. We will also continue to focus on improving operations and fixing and modernizing the foundation of our company. With that said, you will see us doubling down on our purpose and our guest experience. We will get better at innovation and putting customers front and center. We will focus on execution which rests on simple choices, clear goals and consistent measures. \nWe are also upgrading our capabilities to innovate across our business. Specifically, we will provide greater consumer access including through delivery and catering, enhance the digital experience, innovate around our menu and improve our restaurant design. \nWe're working on building a world-class executive team and an organization built for growth. In the last year, we've added new leaders across operations, communications, marketing and human resources. Since our last earnings announcement, we added Chris Brandt as Chief Marketing Officer and just this week, Marissa Andrada joined Chipotle as Chief Human Resources Officer. \nChris Brandt is a seasoned veteran and is quickly assessing the changes needed across marketing so we can get back to emphasizing the craveability of our food and expanding brand loyalty among consumers. Having worked with Chris in the past, I can vouch for his proven track record of delivering innovation that is good for consumers and operations and that provides the financial outcomes needed to grow transactions and sales. I'm confident Chris will quickly find ways to increase our brand relevance and ensure our advertising spend is working harder for us. \nMarissa Andrada has extensive experience in senior human resource roles and prominent consumer brands, and I'm excited that she has joined our team. Marissa's leadership will be essential as we look to strengthen our organization and ensure we have the right structure and capabilities to achieve our strategy and build a culture of innovation and recognition. \nWe are creating a path to performance, and we're in the process of establishing the strategies to get there. I plan to share more details with you on a special call before our next earnings announcement with more details around how we will do these 5 things. First, grow sales transactions, margin and restaurants; second, elevate our brand relevance and further our brand purpose; third, build the right structure and capabilities to sustain performance; fourth, create a people recognition and innovation culture; and fifth, run great restaurants that deliver best-in-class financial performance. In the coming months, you will see us piloting various tests across key innovation focus areas such as consumer access, the digital experience, our menu and restaurant experience in realigning the organization to support the go-forward strategy. \nI do want to acknowledge there's a lot of great work underway, and we are starting to get some traction. Curt Garner's work on the mobile app is paying dividends, and I'm excited about the continued benefits of the digitally enhanced second make-line, which is now in 237 restaurants. Order accuracy has improved in those restaurants, leading to a nearly 20% improvement in customer feedback. Digital sales are our fastest growing area with growth of 20% year-over-year and now represent 8.8% of sales in the first quarter. \nThe customer experience with mobile sales is also improving as our average wait times for mobile orders are down by more than 1/2 since launching Smarter Pickup Times. Curt and I are excited to continue driving progress in these areas, which we believe will help us bring Chipotle to more people in ways that customers appreciate. \nWe are seeing improvements in operations under Scott Boatwright's leadership. I've spent a lot of time in restaurants with Scott over the last several weeks, and I'm impressed with our teams and their dedication to operational excellence. The plans Scott put in place last fall have created a culture of accountability in the field. Our design to provide a great guest experience and are built on a strong foundation of food safety. Most importantly, our customers are noticing, and I'm confident we are focused on the right measures. We have a lot of work ahead of us, but I'm optimistic about the future of Chipotle. We have a strong economic model, a loyal customer base and a powerful purpose.\nWith that, I look forward to sharing more details with you on the special call I mentioned earlier. Now I'll turn the call over to Jack Hartung to provide a financial update.\nExecutives: Thanks, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased with our performance in the first quarter as comp sales accelerated slightly, margins expanded and earnings per share grew. And though it was a solid quarter, we realized we have much more work ahead. Since Brian's arrival, we've been taking a fresh look at every element of our business. We're committed to running great restaurants, putting our customers first, staying true to our purpose, embracing innovation in menu, digital, access in restaurants, improving our execution capabilities and strengthening our culture internally. We're confident that these are the right areas of focus to drive strong performance and increase shareholder value on a sustainable long-term basis. \nBefore I go through the financial results, I want to highlight some important operational accomplishments this quarter. As Brian mentioned, Scott's plan to instill a culture of accountability in field is starting to get the attention of our customers as internal customer satisfaction scores have increased significantly since last summer. Employee turnover at the crew level has improved to the best levels we've seen in many years. We have much more to do, but the culture of accountability, the heightened focus on training and the improved leadership structure in the field is beginning to drive results that are precursors to sustained comp sales improvement. \nBrian highlighted a strong improvement in our digital sales, which grew 20% year-over-year and now accounts for 8.8% of total sales. Mobile sales alone grew 41% year-over-year. And these orders are all fulfilled on our second make-line, which we believe to be a competitive advantage and that we will continue to invest in to make the customer experience as convenient as possible, allowing us to continue to grow digital sales. \nThe majority of second make-line orders are app and web orders but also include third party delivery orders and catering. The surge in mobile sales since relaunching our app late last year gives us confidence that our customers appreciate the great experience. We're proud to say that we were notified just this week that we won the People's Choice Webby Award for best user interface for mobile app. The Webby is an award for excellence on the Internet and is one of the most prestigious industry awards. \nCatering is approximately 1% of sales and remains a large untapped opportunity on which we have increased our focus. We recently expanded catering delivery availability to 1,500 restaurants from 940. And on average, we see about a 15% lift in catering sales when we add delivery. And we're decreasing group size minimums, and we're testing lower-per-person pricing options to expand our catering reach. \nOur delivery sales continue to grow at rapid pace. And when our delivery partners offer free delivery of Chipotle to build their customer base, our customers respond in a big way as they did during Super Bowl weekend when delivery volumes increased nearly 250%. We'll continue to expand the number of delivery partners we work with, and we look to partner with them to offer compelling options to our customers. \nTurning to financial results. We generated revenue of $1.1 billion during the quarter, an increase of 7.4% from last year on comp sales growth of 2.2%. And that's on top of last year's 17% Q1 comp sales. Restaurant level margins for the quarter were 19.5% an improvement of 180 basis points from last year, and earnings per share increased 33% to $2.13. \nThe Q1 comp of 2.2% is comprised of an underlying comp sales growth for the quarter of 2.7%, and that's before the 50 basis point impact from Chiptopia as we lapped deferred revenue from Chiptopia in Q1 of last year. Comp sales were driven by higher average check, primarily from the price increases taken since Q1 of last year. The price increase has averaged about 5% across the menu, and resistance has been less than 20%. The check average also benefited from customers adding queso to their order, which added about 200 basis points. \nApril trends have been impacted by unseasonably cold and wintry weather in much of the country as well as the Easter shift. But taking these impacts into account, underlying April comp transaction trends are similar to Q1. Now keep in mind that we started lapping the first price increase from last year on April 15, which accounted for about 1% of the sales comp. Based on comp trends for the first quarter, we are reiterating our full year comp sales guidance in the low single digits with lower sales comps expected in the first half of the year due to tougher comparisons. Now this guidance does not include any projected impact from the sales growth strategies we're currently developing as it is too early to determine the timing and magnitude of the impact these strategies may have on the comp. \nWe opened 35 new restaurants in the quarter and continue to expect 130 to 150 new openings for the full year. We're in the early stages of building our pipeline for 2019. And while it's too early to provide specific opening range for 2019, we expect to open at or above the 2018 opening level. We're pleased with the strong performance of our new restaurants this year and we'll continue to emphasize high-quality, high-returning new restaurants as we build out the pipeline. \nFood costs during the quarter were 32.4%. Now is down 140 basis points from the 33.8% last year. And that's down from 34.2% in Q4. The decrease from last year was driven by the menu price increase and efficiencies in paper and packaging. We expect relatively stable prices for the rest of 2018 across most items, resulting in food costs at or below the 33% range for the full year. Now our full year estimate is higher than the Q1 due to seasonal shift to source avocados from California, which will start in Q2. \nLabor cost for the quarter were 27.8%, 90 basis points higher than last year. Wage inflation of 5% was offset by the price increase but deleveraged from negative transactions along with the Chiptopia revenue deferral drove the higher labor as a percent of sales. We expect labor costs to improve in the low to mid 27% range in Q2 as we move into our seasonally higher sales months. And we expect labor for the full year to approach 28% as crew and manager merit increases combined with general wage pressures continue to outpace the comp. Occupancy cost for the quarter was 7.4% or flat with last year, and we expect full year to be in a similar range. \nOther operating costs were 12.9% of sales, down from 14.1% last year. Our marketing and promo costs were only 1.8% in the quarter, which is a decrease of about 150 basis points compared to last year. We still anticipate marketing and promo costs to be right around 3% of sales for the full year with elevated spending for the remainder of the year. And while Chris and the marketing team are still working on a plan for Q2 and the rest of the year, we would expect marketing and promo will be in the 3.5% to 4% range in Q2. \nOther operating costs included about 30 basis points of incremental maintenance and repair costs that we discussed on the last call, and we expect M&R to continue at this elevated level during 2018. G&A for the quarter was $77 million or 6.7% of sales, an increase from 6.5% last year. This was lower than expected due to stock comp forfeitures of around $4 million and the 2018 equity grant that was done very late in the quarter. With normalized stock comp in Q2, total G&A is expected to be around $7 million higher, around $84 million. And that run rate puts us on target to hit the $330 million G&A for the full year, which was communicated last quarter. \nUnderlying G&A in the quarter increased $8 million compared to last year to support our growth as well as several initiatives including new formalized training program and operational changes in the field. This increase comes after 3 years of flat G&A despite opening up 650 restaurants. As we fully develop our strategic plans to strengthen our unit economics and drive sustainable sales growth, we may need to adjust how and where we invest our G&A. As such, these G&A estimates for the second quarter and the full year is subject to change and we'll update you on any known changes during the special investor call Brian mentioned earlier. \nDepreciation was 4.1% of sales for the quarter, an increase from 3.7% last year. We expect depreciation to remain at about 4% for several quarters as we accelerate depreciation for items expected to be replaced related to the maintenance and repair refresh as well as other capital initiatives that we described in the last call. Our pretax income was $94.2 million, and our effective tax rate for the quarter was 36.9%. I'd like to spend a few more minutes I normally would on this tax rate to put it in the right context. \nFirst of all, the actual tax rate we expect to pay the government is around 28%, not 36.9%. This tax rate of 36.9% includes about 810 basis points, the bulk of which are noneconomic accounting items related to stock compensation issued in previous years. In essence, during the quarter, we wrote off deferred tax assets related to previously issued stock comp because the related performance shares either did not vest until they expired, or this year is vested at a much lower value. So the related deferred tax asset on our balance sheet needed to be written off or written down and the write-off flows through the tax expense line. \nWe expect no such write-off in Q2 and Q3, so our effective tax rate is expected to be around 28.8% in those quarters. During the fourth quarter, additional performance shares may expire. And if they do, we'll write off the related deferred tax assets for those awards. Again, we'll not actually pay a higher tax rate, but the write-off will flow through the tax line. We expect the tax rate including this write-off in Q4 will be around 38.4%. \nBefore I leave the discussion on taxes, I want to briefly walk through the components of our underlying tax rate. There are 5 key components to the underlying rate. First, our federal tax rate is statutory 21%. Second, our estate tax rate is about 5.6%, and it's higher than last year's rate because of the lower federal rate. That takes our rate to 26.6%. Third, we lost part of the deduction for free meals we give to our restaurant teams, which adds 1.3% to the rate, and it takes us to 27.9%. Fourth, about 1.6% is added related to the tax law change where all named executive officer compensation over $1 million is not deductible. And fifth, our rate is reduced by about 60 basis points for employer wage credits and other miscellaneous items. And that gets us to the 28.8% I mentioned earlier. \nFor the full year taken into account -- taken all this new account and adding about 4% on an annual basis for the noneconomic write-off of deferred tax items I talked about earlier, we estimate that the 2018 effective full year tax rate will be around 33%. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet and end the quarter with $580 million in cash and investments. And we generated $200 million in cash from operations. \nDuring the first quarter, we repurchased 68 million of our stock, an average price of $311 per share, and we spent $58 million on capital investments outlined on the previous call. We still expect opportunistically to purchase -- repurchase shares throughout the year, invest in the capital items we discussed on the last call and maintain a cash investment balance of about $500 million. \nAs I mentioned on the last earnings call, the overall guidance we provided then and we're reiterating today does not factor in any potential strategic changes arising from hiring a new CEO. As Brian mentioned earlier, we will need to realign the organization in order to support and execute our updated strategy. We also plan to carefully analyze underperforming assets during the second quarter. \nThis organizational review and the asset review will likely entail some onetime costs in 2018 that are too early to quantify. But these initiatives are intended to support and strengthen our economic model and set us up to execute our strategic plan and deliver long-term shareholder value. We'll share more details with you later this quarter. \nWe're encouraged by our first quarter results, and we're optimistic about the direction we're headed. We're confident that the changes we're making to our leadership and the realignment of our organization will enable us to be more nimble and more innovative in all areas: customer access, digital, menu and the restaurant environment, and it will allow us to execute better to deliver on our commitments to our guests, our employees and our shareholders. \nWe look forward to sharing more details about our plans at the special investor call, which will be scheduled sometime before our Q2 earnings call. Operator, we'll now open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Nicole Miller from Piper Jaffray.\nAnalysts: Jack, a quick one for you. Could you repeat CapEx? You're going pretty quick through the numbers, I just wanted to check that. I wanted to check that real quick and then ask Brian a quick question.\nExecutives: Yes, Nicole, the CapEx right now we expect will be about the same as we outlined on the last call. It's going to be in the neighborhood of $300 million. About 1/3 of that is new stores. The other 2/3 is existing stores. The big items there is the refresh that we talked about, which is about $50 million. Another big piece was about $25 million for the digitized second make-line, and then there's another number of other things that we outlined in the last call, but those are still intact now. Nicole, just like I mentioned, our guidance hasn't taken into account the impact of strategy. It's possible that we may refine that or adjust that throughout the year and we'll give you a full recap on any changes when we talk to you before the next earnings call.\nAnalysts: And then, Brian, just a good -- a big-picture question for you, and thanks for your time. Do you see this as a recovery story or a global growth opportunity? Just curious how you see this playing out long term. And you talked about 5 pieces that you want to execute. Can you give us any little detail before the next call on maybe some of the low hanging fruit versus longer-term solutions?\nExecutives: Yes. Sure, Nicole. First, I think the opportunity is clearly a recovery story in the U.S. and will be focused on chasing what I believe is a powerful brand that has really strong economics, strong purpose that when we tie the elements that I outlined in my earlier comments and we'll go into much further detail on our special call, I think the opportunity is really exciting for what this brand has in front of it. The innovation will be across the business, as I mentioned, in access, digital, menu and frankly, we'll double down on our fundamentals. So I think the story of recovery, and then where that recovery takes us, I think, is also really exciting, but that's much longer-term discussion.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Tarantino from Robert W. Baird & Company.\nAnalysts: Brian, just a couple of questions kind of high-level, how you're thinking about how this plays out over the next few years. Are you thinking, I guess, directionally that you're going to need to make a lot of investments in the business? I know you talked about realigning the structure, but do you think there's going to be a big step-up in expenses related to that? And then secondly, I know Jack mentioned next year you opened a similar number of units or maybe a little higher, but how are you thinking about unit growth as you execute this turnaround strategy? Do you think you need to slow or moderate the unit growth in the out-years to accomplish what you envisioned?\nExecutives: Okay. Thanks, David. Your first question, I think we can get into all the details of how we see the plan playing out forward. I think some of the good news is though, as I look into the business, like a great area of focus that people have been asking me about is our marketing spend. I think the marketing spend is one of those areas that we believe there's a lot of opportunity to take those dollars that we're currently allocating and make the brand much more visible with what we have. And then we're going to put in place more of a test-and-learn approach on the initiatives that we'll roll out. So we'll have clarity on what we believe the return is for the investment that we're making before we make those decisions to go beyond our current plans. So I think the recovery plan that we'll be putting in place or as I talked about earlier, our path to performance will be based on leveraging the idea of testing and proving out propositions while at the same token, with our organization, rebuild capability and restructure to support the strategy that I believe will set us up for growth in the near term and longer term. Your second question regarding units, the good news is the economics of the units that we're opening continue to look very strong. And as mentioned in the script, we see no reason for us to change the pace that we are experiencing this year. And obviously, as we to get further into our plan, we'll give the appropriate updates as the time permits when it's right to do that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore from AllianceBernstein.\nAnalysts: Congratulations, Brian, on the new role. I wanted to ask you if I may, one is about the quarter that just passed and then now sort of going forward. So in terms of the quarter that just passed, I guess I was surprised that what appears to be a fairly quick impact you might be having, a couple of things that you've seen or maybe new creative around marketing and then a waste management initiative that looks like it has some pretty big opportunities in terms of in-restaurant waste management. So I guess from my perspective, to what extent is this you, Brian, kind of putting your stamp already on that? And do you see a lot of low hanging fruit like what some of these initiatives seem to suggest just in terms of sort of basic systematic approaches? So that was question one. And then question two, if you could just talk a little bit about what you meant by consumer meaningful innovation across the business in the context of what's always been a very simple, straightforward menu and the operations that go with that.\nExecutives: Yes. Sure. So first, obviously, thank you for the kind words. Very excited to be in the CEO role of Chipotle. It's loaded with opportunity, which I think is what you're asking about. And what I'll tell you is in the short term, I think there are real opportunities for us to make simple pivots to increase, I think the appeal of our brand to those customers that are already very much big fans. One of the big surprises for me, frankly, even once it got announced that I was taking this role was the amount of people that reached out to saying how much love Chipotle and they love the food. And I think just with the most recent advertising, we made a little pivot towards reminding people what is great about the ingredients. This Food with Integrity purpose really resonates and reminding people why they feel good about eating Chipotle, I think, is always a good approach. So you'll continue to see us make simple pivots like that while we also continue to push this brand forward in a big way from the standpoint of access as it relates to digital innovation, menu as it relates to menu innovation that leverages our operating model, which I believe is something very special in this industry. And it allows us to do a lot of exciting things, whether it's dayparts or simple menu tweaks that I think will broaden the appeal. And then, obviously, I think you're kind of mentioning your question about waste management and such. Look, there's always opportunity to be better on the cost side, and we're going to continue to look for those opportunities along the way because that's just frees up the ability to give the customer more of what they want and our team members a better experience to provide the experience we want them to provide. So lots of opportunities I think in the short term. We're going to be very cognizant of what are the things we pace in sequence in the near term and whether the things we put into test to ensure we're focusing on the right things over the next 18 to 24 months.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia from William Blair.\nAnalysts: Jack, quick question on the restaurant-level margin. I know you beat by a good amount in the first quarter. I think some of that, as you mentioned with marketing, we'll catch up as the year goes on. Are you still looking for 17.5 to 18.5 for the year? And then longer term, I guess with -- Brian, with your leadership, I mean how do you think about the long-term restaurant-level margin at Chipotle as you talk about new dayparts balancing the sales versus margin?\nExecutives: Yes, Sharon, on the margin range, we had a very nice quarter. It was aided by lower marketing. The good news is, Brian and Chris to the extent they came in and we're able to look at what marketing was doing, they were able to redirect dollar so they weren't spent. And so that's kind of dry powder. So that's dry powder that we have for future quarters. I think that's a very good thing. I would say the range is 17.5 to 18.5, now appears quite conservative. I don't know that I would change it. I think what I'd do is we're going to probably hit for the year at the high end of that. Could we beat it slightly? Sure. I just wouldn't want to call it a victory just yet. But getting out at the gate this strong that show that we have some great margin potential. And then you wanted to know how the margin potential going forward. If you want general margin potential, Sharon, I can answer that. I still think that our margins are going to be highly contingent around volume. Like, for example, if we're in this 18.5% to 19% or so for this year, if we get up to $2.2 million volume, we can do a 22% margin. If we get to a $2.4 million volume, we can do a 24% margin. So really, the biggest lever to pull is bringing more customers in. And we bring more customers in, we know that our model levers up pretty significantly.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Glass from Morgan Stanley.\nAnalysts: Two questions. One is when you look at the brand and you've looked at it from afar, and now you're looking at it from the inside? How do you think about the price-value relationship in this business versus when you came from? Is there an opportunity, for example, to broaden the price-value relationships so you can capture more customers? Or are you happy with kind of the price-value? So think about just how you're thinking about that price value equation for the brand going forward. And maybe just secondly, in your mind, what's the right time frame for us to look at your initiatives that you're contemplating and how they're going to play out. And is this a year of investment and the impact is really felt in '19? Or do you think there can be some meaningful impact and changes inside of 2018.\nExecutives: Look, here's what I would tell you is the value proposition at Chipotle is tremendously strong. And now with that said, we will always be looking for innovation that continues to enhance that value proposition. The most important thing I think you can do for a healthy value proposition is you should never get complacent on where you stand. So we will be on the side of the consumer, making sure that we give them the value proposition that excites them to come back over and over again. So all these initiatives we'll be talking about, one of the ways that you make sure it's consumer relevant is it rings the bell for our customer on that value proposition, whether that value proposition takes place in mobile, digital, loyalty, menu, access, those are all important things. So that's the one piece. Your second question about time line, look, here's what I would tell you is as opportunities present themselves, we will walk through those opportunities to grow the business. As we find opportunities that yield even bigger benefits, through testing and learning and iterating. Those things will quite take a little bit longer, but I think there are simple wins on our way to our path to what I think is going to be really accelerated opportunities in the future. So that's how I think about it. It's really a combination of both. We'll find some singles on our way to finding home runs.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Karen Holthouse from Goldman Sachs.\nAnalysts: So obviously, looking forward to the call that we're going to get in a month or 2 months with some more detail on this. But thinking about that call, is that something that's really going to be focused on where there are opportunities at the margin level or to drive sales? Or should we be also thinking about there's going to be discussion of any sort of more structural changes, whether that's the balance sheet is refranchising something that you're considering? How should we think about kind of what's on the table or topics for a discussion there?\nExecutives: Yes. What I would tell is we're going to use that special call the opportunity to give clarity even further into the strategy, the structure necessary to execute that strategy and what those key focus areas are to put Chipotle on the path to performance that we believe is highly attainable. So it will be comprehensive, and I think you'll find it will be choiceful. And I think there is power in simplicity, power in choice and power in a focused organization. So obviously, it will be a comprehensive discussion and the good news is we'll have our entire leadership team present to be able to really discuss our path forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays.\nAnalysts: Two things, one, just on the comp recovery, maybe from an outsider or actually most recently, a competitor's perspective, I'm just wondering, in your view, what do you think has been the greatest impediment to the Chipotle recovery over the past couple of years? Hence, I guess which of these initiatives you're talking about will be the most impactful, I guess, is a different way to look at it? And then the second question, which is on the fact that you came from Taco Bell, which obviously has left the laterals, but the one thing that's quite different is Taco Bell, being close to 100% franchise model, now you're 100% company-operated model. Just wondering, qualitatively, how is the approach differ when you look at this just pros and cons to the franchising versus the company operated side, I'm just wondering, as you now come into your new role, how you have to think about things differently in that perspective.\nExecutives: Yes, sure. Look, I think to answer your first question, Chipotle, smartly, under Scott Boatwright's leadership, has refocused the fundamentals in running these restaurants. We've put clarity into roles, we've put focus on throughput, and we've also put high expectations on the guest experience and the food experience we're going to provide. Those fundamentals are critical whether you own the restaurants or whether you franchise them to people. So there really is no trade-off in what are the fundamentals to having a great restaurant? The only thing that I think Scott has done very well as you put in a culture of accountability and a culture where people know they can count on each other to train, support and grow. And I think that is a foundational element for any outside that we will experience in this business. We can never lose sight on running great restaurants and having great people that lead those restaurants and supporting them with a wonderful culture and tremendous opportunities. So that's the first piece. The second piece is, I think the brand has been invisible. So I think if you combine great fundamentals in the restaurant with now a visible brand that has a powerful purpose and really craveable food, it's a recipe for a lot of opportunity that can play well in the way the customers want to eat food today and I believe how they want to eat food in the future. So I'm tremendously excited about the fundamentals that we are maniacally focused on, coupled with identifying how we make this brand much more visible and get a narrative back out there in explaining what makes our brand different, what makes our brand connect with people, feel good about the way they eat and live and why they still feel great about carrying a baggage full with them. And I think you had a question on franchising? We see no need to go down that path right now, given the economic model that we have and the returns that we get with building new restaurants so -- but thanks for the question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bittner from Oppenheimer & Co.\nAnalysts: I have 2 questions for you guys both on just how you're thinking about the asset base. As you talk about an asset base review, first of all, is there an additional smell test you're doing on the unit economic threshold required to earn the right to stay in the asset base that you can talk to us about? And then, Brian, you talked about looking at your unit base in improving the accessibility of it. Could the implementation of drive-throughs play a role in the accessibility strategy, where it makes sense? Or is accessibility really just focused solely on digital? And I ask that question just in the spirit of where you came from, obviously seeing the benefits of drive-throughs.\nExecutives: Brian, I'll address the first question on the asset base. We haven't changed our threshold for what is the higher-returning asset. What we're looking at though is we had a number of restaurants that booked before the drop in sales or strong cash flows, strong returning stores. We opened a number of restaurants during a tough period where we got off to a slow start. So our asset review is going to look at all the restaurants that are clear underperformers, and these will be negative cash flow stores. So we're not looking at stores that are positive cash flow that the return is a little underperforming. We're going to look at stores that -- restaurants that are not cash flowing that maybe we picked the wrong site, maybe they got to a wrong start and made a bad first impression and it's going to be difficult, if not impossible, to change that. And to give you an order of magnitude, the review while we're still in the middle of it, we're looking at something less than 100 restaurants. So it's not a huge list of restaurants but that's kind of the total population that we're looking at. We'll review each and every one of them, and we'll look at the whole story from a financial standpoint, from a real estate standpoint, from a what kind of first impression do we make. And then we'll make some very careful choices about what to do with the assets.\nExecutives: This is Brian. So your second question with regard to access, look, I think innovation in access, obviously, you are not surprised by the idea that, look, digital is a key piece of the puzzle, right, whether it's through the mobile access, delivery as access, also kiosk as access, catering as access. I mean I love the list that I'm rattling off here. The trick for us is figuring out what comes first and how we prioritize it accordingly. Now drive-throughs, I think, are an interesting proposition for Chipotle as an element. It will be something that will definitely part of our access innovation program, but that's in the scheme of what's going to happen in the very near term versus what's more of a longer-term access innovation play drive through fall further on that longer-term scale.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Matt McGinley from Evercore ISI.\nAnalysts: First question is on the -- for Jack, first is what you guided in February on the restaurant margin, it came in about 3 to 3.5 points better than expected. And we can see what is going to happen over the course of the year with COGS and labor expense, but a lot of that came from other operating expenses in this quarter. And I know that 150 bps was related to the ad spend shifts. So I'm curious what else in that line item would look better over the course of the year. Is that just not doing maintenance? Is there something else that is just looking better than you anticipated in that line item?\nExecutives: Well, thanks, Matt. The food costs behave really well. Avocados were something that took out a bite out of our margins last year. They got better late in the fourth quarter, and then they got better again. And you just talk about avocados, it's kind of almost every year. It has a big impact when it goes up and down. Nearly 50% of our transactions include guacamole. And so when prices shoot up, which by the way, they shot up from something below $30 a case to nearly $80 a case for part of the fourth quarter. So they've come back to kind of normal prices. If they stay at normal prices, we should have a decent food cost during the year. Labor is kind of the same story in terms of wage inflation continues. We expect that they continue and so the guidance I give you, I think, is very reasonable guidance. So I think we got off to a great start. I think the comments that Brian made about Scott and the field -- our field team did a great job of managing food cost to the extent that it was their job to order the right amount of food and control food waste and things like that. They did a great job. They've done a great job manage labor as well. So I think we're off to a great start. I think if we keep these kind of controls, the next big surprise or additive thing would be additional sales. And so some of the things that Brian mentioned go into test, and they test well. And if we put those into more restaurant and we get more sales. We know we have the ability to leverage our margins when we bring more customers in, and that would be a nice thing to report.\nAnalysts: Got it. So Brian, I've heard a lot really from external people that when you look at the supply chain that Chipotle has versus other restaurant chains that just the way the food is prepped and the way that it is -- it flows through that supply chain, it always makes it harder to innovate Chipotle versus other chains. Having been to other restaurant chains, do you feel that there's a big factor that sort of limits your innovation at that company? Or do you see this as kind of greenfield and there's a lot that you can do?\nExecutives: Yes, thanks for question. Look, I actually think the -- I'll break up your comment. I guess supply chain, meaning the ingredients that we use, I see no barrier to innovation. If anything, I'd see this great ingredients to be able to further distance ourselves from other restaurant alternatives. And then from a standpoint of then finishing that ingredient in the restaurant, it is a really powerful model. I mean if there's one thing that I'm really impressed by is the throughput capability of this line is something really special and unique. And I actually think it's an advantage to figure out how to do innovation that can build from a throughput machine. I don't think there are many places where you can say, \"Well, I can have that great food done at that speed and then we can innovate on that foundation or that platform.\" And you'll see when we're talking about some of the innovations we're talking about, it just takes advantage of what I believe is a competitive advantage. So I think we're going to be able to innovate and distance ourselves and really put ourselves into what I believe is something very special that will delight customers and give our team members the ability to execute flawlessly.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andy Barish from Jeffries.\nAnalysts: Yes, I was wondering on that, actually, follow-up on a couple of those comments if there is some throughput data you're willing to share kind of currently versus a year ago. And then secondly, on innovation, not only supply chain, but just the physical plant and now the need for second make-lines. Is the space constraints make it more difficult to innovate? Or is that sort of an outmoded thought and there's ways to work around that with your fresh-eyes view on the business now?\nExecutives: Yes, thanks for the question, because the second make-line is actually a huge enabler for our business to take throughput to the next level, frankly. And the reason is we put digital capability into 250-plus restaurants, but the fact that we already have the second make-line physically there in all our restaurants is a huge opportunity for us to both innovate as well as drive throughput even further on our consumer-facing line as well as our second make-line. That second make-line has some efficiencies that we are delighted that we have in place because as we dial up the innovation in digital and we dial up that off-premise access, it presents a great opportunity for us to really enhance our throughput on both fronts.\nAnalysts: And then any throughput numbers you're willing to share or is it a little early for that?\nExecutives: Look, we can probably get into those details, Scott, it will be available as part of the special call we're going to do. And we're happy to take you through that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe from JPMorgan.\nAnalysts: Brian, talk about how you guys put in both fourth meal or the so-called late-night daypart as well as breakfast. And you've mentioned daypart a couple of different times and I was wondering what that could potentially mean at Chipotle whether it's different products at different times of the day, which can happen certainly within any quick service or fast casual type of format and whether it's possible to have breakfast without a drive-through or maybe you could put breakfast in just the dense urban stores while not necessarily putting them in suburban stores, just thinking about what kind of potential you think dayparts really mean to the brand at this point.\nExecutives: Yes, sure. Look, I think one of the things that's really excited about the daypart opportunity for Chipotle is today, we're opening at 10:30, 10:45, and we're closing roughly around 10:00 p.m. And there's opportunities to expand those hours and leverage our existing food and our existing platform in a very seamless fashion. Then you look at the obvious dayparts within those extended hours, and you quickly see where there's opportunity where we have some downtime where frankly I think with some marketing and some product innovation, we could turn those downtimes into transaction driving times. So as I think about it right now, there is daypart-expansion opportunity with our current model, and you layer on some menu innovation coupled with some marketing communication, I see a real ability to drive the existing platform in those dayparts without having to take the step today all the way through breakfast, introducing a whole new food platform. So that's where our thinking is today, not to say that in the future you may not even expand those hours further, and you need to think about new food platforms but that's not in the plan right now.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Palmer from RBC Capital Markets.\nAnalysts: Brian, first, a question on consumer scores, i.e., you mentioned something about becoming more consumer-centric. What is the consumer telling you about Chipotle today and the opportunities to improve perhaps in ways that you see in the brand deteriorated in those scores and just in ways that you just feel like it's underachieving. And that separately, just building on that last thing that you mentioned, the operating model, everyone's always assumed that Chipotle's operating model because you have those limited number of wells in front of us, it doesn't have the ability to handle new menu news or even use price because of that simple menu, and those are 2 tools that you use with great effect in the past. And so I think people are having a hard time understanding how you're going to use those going forward. So those 2 -- that comment would be helpful as well.\nExecutives: Sure. So on your first question regarding the consumer, what we see is a real opportunity to make the brand more visible and be more top of mind with people to remind them why they love Chipotle. When you remind people about the fact that they buy into this idea of food integrity, cultivating a better world, they instantly feel better about the food they're eating. And we make good on that promise. So I think there's a real opportunity to be much more visible on why you want to be connected to this brand, why you believe in this brand. And based on the information I'm seeing, that resonates with how people want to eat today and how they will want to eat in the future. Look, there's also huge opportunities to get people access. One of our biggest complaints, frankly, is access to the brand. The brand is not that convenient. I know we have 2,400 stores, almost 2,500 stores. We, as a result, are not that convenient to people. So you've got people saying, \"Hey, when can I do mobile ordering? When can I do delivery? When can I get Chipotle to me?\" And the good news is more than, I think, 50% people don't even realize that we started to do these things. So there is tremendous opportunity of educating people on why they should feel good about the brand, why they will love the food, why it's craveable, because it gives them all the customization, the abundance that they're looking for with the ingredients that they want, and then you combine that with now giving them more access and getting food to them on their terms. It's really exciting proposition. Your second question on our ability to innovate, the line has flexibility so long as we first test and understand the demand that we're generating. If we prepare ourselves for what is going to happen, Scott and his operators will be capable to use our supply chain and our operating model to execute and meet consumers' expectations. Where you run into problems is when you get ahead of a forecast. And one of the things we're going to put in place here is when we are working on innovation, we're going to pilot that innovation so that we can have a prediction of what's going to happen and prepare the operating model accordingly to support it. So I'm very optimistic about opportunities that just leverage, getting more access to what Chipotle is today, and then you add some innovation, and I think you broaden the appeal, and we have predictability what that's going to perform, Scott and the operators will be able to execute.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Gregory Francfort from Bank of America.\nAnalysts: I have 2 questions, the first for Brian. Have you looked at portion sizing and your thoughts on whether or not consumers are paying you for your portion sizes now, or if there's an opportunity to take either up or down? And then I think you had also talked about employee turnover coming down recently. Any metrics around that? And what do you think is driving that? Have you made any changes on the training front? Or -- because the industry has been going up and so that would be kind of impressive, I guess I'm wondering what you guys are doing differently.\nExecutives: Sure. So the piece on employee turnover, I think that's a testament to Scott, putting clarity of what you're supposed to be doing in your role, how you support each other then in the restaurant and then providing clarity of how you can grow in this organization. And look, people like to stay in places where they believe they're appreciated and they have the opportunity to grow. And that's the culture that we're putting into the restaurant, and I think that's why you're seeing our turnover move down. And it's really exciting because the more we can push that turnover down, the more we find ourselves retraining the organization and we execute better. It's that simple. So Marissa, who's new to the team, she's going to be laser focused on how we drive this culture and training all the way through the restaurant while Scott partners with her to take from a culture of accountability to also a culture of growth. And I think if you've put those 2 things together, you will feel highly appreciated and believe that there's a future for them at Chipotle. What was your first question?\nAnalysts: The first question was just on portion sizing. And if you looked at whether -- yes.\nExecutives: Yes, yes. So look, one of the things clearly that people love about Chipotle is the customization proposition, and we're going to continue to figure out how we get more consistent in our execution for people so that they don't feel like they got too much this time or they got too little. So one of the things that I love about the experiences -- and the consumer knows is we're a place that wants to give them the experience that they're after with their food. And that's not going to change. So if people want a little more, we'll try to give them a little more. They want a little less, we'll give them a little less. But regardless, whether they're asking for a little more or a little less, one of the things Scott is focused on is how do you continue to get more consistent so people feel like they're getting the experience they got the last time as well as the experience they can count on for the next time. So that's where we're focused on, is how do we get more consistent with that experience, but we're never going to tell the consumer you can't ask us for a little more or a little less.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Charles from Cowen and Company.\nAnalysts: Longer-term question for Brian and a short-term one for Jack. So Brian, as you think about the road ahead, can you help us compare and contrast the starting points when you look at Taco Bell in 2011 and Chipotle in 2017, what do you think of the different factors at play here that helped shape the turnaround, if you will? And then Jack, you mentioned as well as, you see more comp trends that continued in April, how are you framing that, just looking at on a -- you mentioned 3 year, or how should we think about that perhaps just for simplicity? If you disclose the number, it might be helpful.\nExecutives: So why don't I go first and I'll hand it over to you, Jack. So here's what I believe for Chipotle. I believe the brand has been invisible. And I think as the brand becomes visible and we lead culture, that's going to be a huge opportunity going forward. This brand needs to be leading culture, not reacting to it. And the people that are loyal to this brand, that's what they want to be a part of. The other piece that is very exciting about this company is, look, there's limited innovation happening in small scale, and the opportunity for us is how do we take some of that invasion to pilot it and get it to a place where we can now do it at scale and the opportunities, we talked about a few of them, right? They go from access to digital, to menu, even the restaurant design opportunities going forward. That is huge opportunity. A brand that has a lot of relevance that's culturally right and leading, coupled with innovation, built on strong fundamentals that give people great food at a fast experience at a great value, I'll like the future. I really get excited about that because those are things that I think, as we put together this leadership team here with Chris and Scott and Marissa and Jack and Curt and Laurie, it is mission one to make this brand visible. And right next to it is be culturally relevant. So all the innovation and the fundamentals that we've put in place are going to, I think, attract people not only to work here but attract people to continue to be our loyal customers. And that's why I will tell you about the long term.\nExecutives: And Andrew, in terms of what I looked at when I made the comments about April. We look at dollar trends. We looked at what our expectations were based on what we expect with the Easter shift, what normal seasonality would bring. The weather definitely hit us during parts of the month. I'm sure that's not a surprise to you. From a comp standpoint, we look at it mainly from a 1-year comp standpoint. If you're getting multiple years, you have to go back to 3. A 2-year trend will not give you anything meaningful. '16 and '17 lined up. '16 was a step down. '17 was a step up. So if you wanted to do a 3-year layer, you're probably get in the same ballpark. But for purposes of what we did, we just kept it very, very simple, looked at April, compared to where our previous trends were. And underneath it all, it looks like the trends were very similar when you factor weather out.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Will Slabaugh from Stephens Inc.\nAnalysts: On the 5% pricing and then maybe more specifically on longer-term pricing plans, in general, I realize it's been a while since Chipotle have taken any meaningful pricing, but 5%, obviously, a decent ways ahead of where the rest of the industry is. So I'm curious, number one, if you plan to change the strategy to be more consistent in terms of low price increases; and number two, if you see any material difference in customer pushback to the pricing. In some of markets that we've talked, it's being lower performing markets in recent years or if that 20% level that you talked about earlier has been fairly consistent?\nExecutives: Yes. Every 3-year pricing -- we've done it kind of 3 times in a row now, it's not necessarily strategy that we say, \"Okay, no more price increases for the next 3 years.\" It just kind of happened. This past time, we didn't want to do it while we're trying to bring customers back into the restaurant. Before that, labor emplacement was very tame, and so we had strong comps until we can lever our margin without resorting to pricing. It's a powerful advantage to have if you can continue to build your model, continue to expand leverage without constantly increasing menu prices, and so we took advantage of that luxury. Going forward, we're going to do what we need to do. And if that means doing smaller more regular price increases, we're certainly open to that. If we can lever our model, if we get the top line going and we lever the model without a price increase, we think we can drive greater value to the customer. Customers always love it when they get greater value. So we're not going to predetermine what and when we will do anything with pricing, but we're open to doing something other than kind of a 3-year cadence. And in terms of the resistance, we just don't see much resistance across the company. The only time we've seen it and we've seen it in the past as well, we see it a bit on the West Coast, and that's it. Otherwise, so there's the company, our customers, I think we provide a great value. And value is not just based on price, it's based on high-quality ingredients, it's based on a lot of food, it's based on an environment that they enjoy. And it's actually the value that we bring is the harder thing to bring based on food, based on environment, based on the overall experience. Price is something that our consumers sure what they like to play -- who wouldn't. But when they come to Chipotle and they get a great experience in a nice restaurant, the food is delicious, they call that a great value.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris O'Cull from Stifel.\nAnalysts: First, Jack, I apologize if I missed it, but what was the traffic decline in the quarter? And then secondly, Brian, several of the opportunities you mentioned to improve access for the brand seemed to make -- could take some time to build, but are there opportunities to quickly address the traffic declines you're seeing?\nExecutives: I'll answer around the traffic. The comp came from an increase in average check, and you can take the 5% price increase. It's less than 20%, which is rounded up to 20% for queso added to, so you can back into a transaction impact was so it'll be at the 3.3% or so range, 3.3%, 3.5%, something like that, so that's the underlying traffic.\nExecutives: And then to answer your question on what was my belief on the transaction opportunity going forward, look, I think that's a real opportunity and one of the things that Chris and the marketing organization are going to be centered on. And the good news is I believe the combination of the brand visibility, the innovation that I talked about, I think there are opportunities in the near term that we can start putting into place, putting into action that make it a material impact on our transactions. And then over time, you'll see the culmination of all these things coming together, I think, play even bigger impact on the transactions and the number of people coming into our restaurants. So it's really a combination of the digital, the menu, the access, programs like loyalty. Those are all things that are going to be centered on making sure we are driving transactions as part of the proposition.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Strelzik from BMO Capital Markets.\nAnalysts: Over the last couple of years, there's been a shift in focus at different points in time trying to bring back sales among existing customers at some points and finding new customers at some points. I'm just wondering, Brian, do you think about the opportunity set in that way, think of the customer base in that way? And if so, where do you see the greatest opportunities over the next 6, 12, 24 months?\nExecutives: Yes, look, here's what we know about our customers. Every age cohort loves Chipotle, okay? And we overindex with young people. And this brand is a youthful spirit. It's a challenger, right? It's breaking convention of what accessible food done fast is. And that appeals broadly. So our goal is not to be exclusive. Our goal is to be inclusive, and our goal is to drive transactions with a youthful spirit, a meaningful positioning and continue to leverage the strength of being a youthful brand that connects with youth. So that's how I look at it. Obviously, Chris and I are digging deep into it because we need to understand the reasons why you either slow down or increase your usage with us. And then we want to make sure we understand why all these different age cohorts are excited about being in the Chipotle business. Our goal is every category buyer could come in Chipotle. That's simple. We probably won't get all of them in the near term, but I'm going to try in the long term.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brett Levy from Deutsche Bank.\nAnalysts: If you could share a little bit, Jack, this question is for you on the margins. You mentioned that you think you can get to the high end of the 17.5, 18.5 range, and then you said you could possibly exceed it. But you also mentioned earlier that nothing is really being built into the plan with respect to what Brian's integration and whose ideas can have. Can you just balance between what you were saying because it sounded like you said it's going to be without any implementation of Brian's strategies, but it also sounded like you were talking about so many additional sales?\nExecutives: I think you heard it right. We reiterated our guidance, that comps would be in the low single digits. So the margin comments deal with that assumption, to the extent we have strategies that go through pilot and are worthy of a rollout, meaning we expect to get a return on our investment. That's not included in the comp. It's just too early to know what those things might be or what the magnitude might be so this is kind of a base case, if you will.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session, and I would like to turn the call back over to Coralie for closing remarks.\nExecutives: Thank you for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our special call in late Q2. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.\nOperator: Greetings, and welcome to the Chipotle Mexican Grill First Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Coralie Witter.\nExecutives: Hello, everyone, and welcome to our call today. By now, you should have access to our earnings announcement released this afternoon for the first quarter of 2018.

We refer you to the Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K as updated in our subsequent Form 10-Qs for discussion of these risks.\nI'd also like to remind everyone that we've adopted a self-imposed quiet period, restricting communications with investors during that period. The quiet period will begin on the 16th day of the last month of each fiscal quarter and continues until the next earnings conference call. For the second quarter of 2018, it will begin June 16 and continue through our second quarter earnings release. \nOur discussion today will also include non-GAAP financial measures, a reconciliation of which can be found on the Presentations page of the Investor Relations section of our website. We will start today's call with some brief prepared remarks from Brian Niccol, Chief Executive Officer; and Jack Hartung, Chief Financial Officer. We will allow plenty of time at the end of those remarks for questions. In the room and also available during the Q&A period are: Scott Boatwright, Chief Restaurant Officer; Chris Brandt, Chief Marketing Officer; Laurie Schalow, Chief communications Officer; and Marissa Andrada, Chief Human Administrations Officer. \nWith that, I will now turn the call over to Brian Niccol.\nExecutives: Thanks, Coralie, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm excited to be talking to you today on my first earnings call with Chipotle. Chipotle is such a strong brand with incredible equity built over the last 25 years, and I couldn't be more excited about our future. One thing is very clear to me: consumers love our great-tasting food and appreciate that our food is made with integrity. I have admired Chipotle for many years, and I'm excited to have the opportunity to lead the future direction of this incredible company. \nBefore I get into details of this call, I'd like to start by recognizing Steve Ells for creating this amazing concept and for the last 25 years, leading it to becoming one of the most important restaurant brands of our time. I thank Steve for the invaluable time he's spent bringing me up to speed over the past several weeks, and I deeply appreciate him fully handing over the reins to me and giving me the autonomy to lead, innovate and create a new strategy that will ensure our growth for the future. Going forward, Steve has embraced his new role as Executive Chairman. We are fortunate to be able to leverage his creativity and expertise as a culinarian, a visionary and our founder. \nFor those of you who don't know me very well, I'd like to share some of my key beliefs and leadership principles so you know what to expect going forward. I believe it is important to focus on results over activity, to hold people accountable and to be stewards of our business. I believe in the power of innovation and that to be successful, we must create and lead change. I also believe in a winning work ethic and that to win, we need to have an external focus with the ability to quickly read and react to change. And I believe in the power of people so it's important to me that we create a culture that is focused on running and supporting great restaurants, putting the customer first, living our purpose, innovating for today and tomorrow and supporting and recognizing each other. \nBefore I share my view on what changes we need to make, I thought I would start by telling you what is not going to change. We will continue to serve high-quality great-tasting food that consumers crave. We will also continue to focus on improving operations and fixing and modernizing the foundation of our company. With that said, you will see us doubling down on our purpose and our guest experience. We will get better at innovation and putting customers front and center. We will focus on execution which rests on simple choices, clear goals and consistent measures. \nWe are also upgrading our capabilities to innovate across our business. Specifically, we will provide greater consumer access including through delivery and catering, enhance the digital experience, innovate around our menu and improve our restaurant design. \nWe're working on building a world-class executive team and an organization built for growth. In the last year, we've added new leaders across operations, communications, marketing and human resources. Since our last earnings announcement, we added Chris Brandt as Chief Marketing Officer and just this week, Marissa Andrada joined Chipotle as Chief Human Resources Officer. \nChris Brandt is a seasoned veteran and is quickly assessing the changes needed across marketing so we can get back to emphasizing the craveability of our food and expanding brand loyalty among consumers. Having worked with Chris in the past, I can vouch for his proven track record of delivering innovation that is good for consumers and operations and that provides the financial outcomes needed to grow transactions and sales. I'm confident Chris will quickly find ways to increase our brand relevance and ensure our advertising spend is working harder for us. \nMarissa Andrada has extensive experience in senior human resource roles and prominent consumer brands, and I'm excited that she has joined our team. Marissa's leadership will be essential as we look to strengthen our organization and ensure we have the right structure and capabilities to achieve our strategy and build a culture of innovation and recognition. \nWe are creating a path to performance, and we're in the process of establishing the strategies to get there. I plan to share more details with you on a special call before our next earnings announcement with more details around how we will do these 5 things: first, grow sales transactions, margin and restaurants; second, elevate our brand relevance and further our brand purpose; third, build the right structure and capabilities to sustain performance; fourth, create a people recognition and innovation culture; and fifth, run great restaurants that deliver best-in-class financial performance. In the coming months, you will see us piloting various tests across key innovation focus areas such as consumer access, the digital experience, our menu and restaurant experience in realigning the organization to support the go-forward strategy. \nI do want to acknowledge that there's a lot of great work underway, and we are starting to get some traction. Curt Garner's work on the mobile app is paying dividends, and I'm excited about the continued benefits of the digitally enhanced second make-line, which is now in 237 restaurants. Order accuracy has improved in those restaurants, leading to a nearly 20% improvement in customer feedback. Digital sales are our fastest growing area with growth of 20% year-over-year and now represent 8.8% of sales in the first quarter. \nThe customer experience with mobile sales is also improving as our average wait times for mobile orders are down by more than 1/2 since launching Smarter Pickup Times. Curt and I are excited to continue driving progress in these areas, which we believe will help us bring Chipotle to more people in ways that customers appreciate. \nWe are seeing improvements in operations under Scott Boatwright's leadership. I've spent a lot of time in restaurants with Scott over the last several weeks, and I'm impressed with our teams and their dedication to operational excellence. The plans Scott put in place last fall have created a culture of accountability in the field. Our design to provide a great guest experience and are built on a strong foundation of food safety. Most importantly, our customers are noticing, and I'm confident we are focused on the right measures. We have a lot of work ahead of us, but I'm optimistic about the future of Chipotle. We have a strong economic model, a loyal customer base and a powerful purpose.\nWith that, I look forward to sharing more details with you on the special call I mentioned earlier. Now I'll turn the call over to Jack Hartung to provide a financial update.\nExecutives: Thanks, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased with our performance in the first quarter as comp sales accelerated slightly, margins expanded and earnings per share grew. And though it was a solid quarter, we realize we have much more work ahead. Since Brian's arrival, we've been taking a fresh look at every element of our business. We're committed to running great restaurants, putting our customers first, staying true to our purpose, embracing innovation in menu, digital, access in restaurants, improving our execution capabilities and strengthening our culture internally. We're confident that these are the right areas of focus to drive strong performance and increase shareholder value on a sustainable long-term basis. \nBefore I go through the financial results, I want to highlight some important operational accomplishments this quarter. As Brian mentioned, Scott's plan to instill a culture of accountability in field is starting to get the attention of our customers, as internal customer satisfaction scores have increased significantly since last summer. Employee turnover at the crew level has improved to the best levels we've seen in many years. We have much more to do, but the culture of accountability, the heightened focus on training and the improved leadership structure in the field is beginning to drive results that are precursors to sustained comp sales improvement. \nBrian highlighted a strong improvement in our digital sales, which grew 20% year-over-year and now accounts for 8.8% of total sales. Mobile sales alone grew 41% year-over-year. And these orders are all fulfilled on our second make-line, which we believe to be a competitive advantage and that we will continue to invest in to make the customer experience as convenient as possible, allowing us to continue to grow digital sales. \nThe majority of second make-line orders are app and web orders but also include third party delivery orders and catering. The surge in mobile sales since relaunching our app late last year gives us confidence that our customers appreciate the great experience. We're proud to say that we were notified just this week that we won the People's Choice Webby Award for best user interface for mobile app. The Webby is an award for excellence on the Internet and is one of the most prestigious industry awards. \nCatering is approximately 1% of sales and remains a large untapped opportunity on which we have increased our focus. We recently expanded catering delivery availability to 1,500 restaurants from 940. And on average, we see about a 15% lift in catering sales when we add delivery. And we're decreasing group size minimums, and we're testing lower-per-person pricing options to expand our catering reach. \nOur delivery sales continue to grow at a rapid pace. And when our delivery partners offer free delivery of Chipotle to build their customer base, our customers respond in a big way as they did during Super Bowl weekend when delivery volumes increased nearly 250%. We'll continue to expand the number of delivery partners we work with, and we look to partner with them to offer compelling options to our customers. \nTurning to financial results. We generated revenue of $1.1 billion during the quarter, an increase of 7.4% from last year on comp sales growth of 2.2%. And that's on top of last year's 17% Q1 comp sales. Restaurant level margins for the quarter were 19.5% an improvement of 180 bps from last year, and earnings per share increased 33% to $2.13. \nThe Q1 comp of 2.2% is comprised of an underlying comp sales growth for the quarter of 2.7%, and that's before the 50-basis point impact from Chiptopia, as we lap deferred revenue from Chiptopia in Q1 of last year. Comp sales were driven by higher average check, primarily from the price increases taken since Q1 of last year. The price increase has averaged about 5% across the menu, and resistance has been less than 20%. The check average also benefited from customers adding queso to their order, which added about 200 bps. \nApril trends have been impacted by unseasonably cold and wintry weather in much of the country as well as the Easter shift. But taking these impacts into account, underlying April comp transaction trends are similar to Q1. Now keep in mind that we started lapping the first price increase from last year on April 15, which accounted for about 1% of the sales comp. Based on comp trends for the first quarter, we are reiterating our full year comp sales guidance in the low single digits with lower sales comps expected in the first half of the year due to tougher comparisons. Now this guidance does not include any projected impact from the sales growth strategies we're currently developing, as it is too early to determine the timing and magnitude of the impact these strategies may have on the comp. \nWe opened 35 new restaurants in the quarter and continue to expect 130 to 150 new openings for the full year. We're in the early stages of building our pipeline for 2019. And while it's too early to provide specific opening range for 2019, we expect to open at or above the 2018 opening level. We're pleased with the strong performance of our new restaurants this year and we'll continue to emphasize high-quality, high-returning new restaurants as we build out the pipeline. \nFood costs during the quarter were 32.4%. And that was down 140 basis points from the 33.8% last year. And that's down from 34.2% in Q4. The decrease from last year was driven by the menu price increase and efficiencies in paper and packaging. We expect relatively stable prices for the rest of 2018 across most items, resulting in food costs at or below the 33% range for the full year. Now our full year estimate is higher than the Q1 due to seasonal shift to source avocados from California, which will start in Q2. \nLabor cost for the quarter were 27.8%, 90 basis points higher than last year. Wage inflation of 5% was offset by the price increase but deleveraged from negative transactions along with the Chiptopia revenue deferral drove the higher labor as a percent of sales. We expect labor costs to improve in the low to mid 27% range in Q2, as we move into our seasonally higher sales months. And we expect labor for the full year to approach 28%, as crew and manager merit increases combined with general wage pressures continue to outpace the comp. Occupancy cost for the quarter was 7.4% or flat with last year, and we expect full year to be in a similar range. \nOther operating costs were 12.9% of sales, down from 14.1% last year. Our marketing and promo costs were only 1.8% in the quarter, which is a decrease of about 150 bps compared to last year. We still anticipate marketing and promo costs to be right around 3% of sales for the full year, with elevated spending for the remainder of the year. And while Chris and the marketing team are still working on a plan for Q2 and the rest of the year, we would expect marketing and promo will be in the 3.5% to 4% range in Q2. \nOther operating costs included about 30 bps of incremental maintenance and repair costs that we discussed on the last call, and we expect M&R to continue at this elevated level during 2018. G&A for the quarter was $77 million or 6.7% of sales, an increase from 6.5% last year. This was lower than expected due to stock comp forfeitures of around $4 million and the 2018 equity grant that was done very late in the quarter. With normalized stock comp in Q2, total G&A is expected to be around $7 million higher, around $84 million. And that run rate puts us on target to hit the $330 million G&A for the full year, which was communicated last quarter. \nUnderlying G&A in the quarter increased $8 million compared to last year to support our growth as well as several initiatives including new formalized training program and operational changes in the field. This increase comes after 3 years of flat G&A despite opening up 650 restaurants. As we fully develop our strategic plans to strengthen our unit economics and drive sustainable sales growth, we may need to adjust how and where we invest our G&A. As such, these G&A estimates for the second quarter and the full year is subject to change and we'll update you on any known changes during the special investor call Brian mentioned earlier. \nDepreciation was 4.1% of sales for the quarter, an increase from 3.7% last year. We expect depreciation to remain at about 4% for several quarters, as we accelerate depreciation for items expected to be replaced related to the maintenance and repair refresh as well as other capital initiatives that we described in the last call. Our pretax income was $94.2 million, and our effective tax rate for the quarter was 36.9%. I'd like to spend a few more minutes I normally would on this tax rate to put it in the right context. \nFirst of all, the actual tax rate we expect to pay the government is around 28%, not 36.9%. This tax rate of 36.9% includes about 810 bps, the bulk of which are noneconomic accounting items related to stock compensation issued in previous years. In essence, during the quarter, we wrote off deferred tax assets related to previously issued stock comp because the related performance shares either did not vest until they expired, or this year is vested at a much lower value. So the related deferred tax asset on our balance sheet needed to be written off or written down and the write-off flows through the tax expense line. \nWe expect no such write-off in Q2 and Q3, so our effective tax rate is expected to be around 28.8% in those quarters. During the fourth quarter, additional performance shares may expire. And if they do, we'll write off the related deferred tax assets for those awards. Again, we'll not actually pay a higher tax rate, but the write-off will flow through the tax line. We expect the tax rate including this write-off in Q4 will be around 38.4%. \nBefore I leave the discussion on taxes, I want to briefly walk through the components of our underlying tax rate. There are 5 key components to the underlying rate: First, our federal tax rate is statutory 21%. Second, our estate tax rate is about 5.6%, and it's higher than last year's rate because of the lower federal rate. That takes our rate to 26.6%. Third, we lost part of the deduction for free meals we give to our restaurant teams, which adds 1.3% to the rate, and it takes us to 27.9%. Fourth, about 1.6% is added related to the tax law change where all named executive officer compensation over $1 million is not deductible. And fifth, our rate is reduced by about 60 bps for employer wage credits and other miscellaneous items. And that gets us to the 28.8% I mentioned earlier. \nFor the full year, taking into account -- taking all this into account and adding about 4% on an annual basis for the noneconomic write-off of deferred tax items I talked about earlier, we estimate that the 2018 effective full year tax rate will be around 33%. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet and ended the quarter with $580 million in cash and investments, and we generated $200 million in cash from operations. \nDuring the first quarter, we repurchased $68 million of our stock at an average price of $311 per share, and we spent $58 million on capital investments, outlined on the previous call. We still expect opportunistically to purchase -- repurchase shares throughout the year, invest in the capital items we discussed on the last call and maintain a cash investment balance of about $500 million. \nAs I mentioned on the last earnings call, the overall guidance we provided then and we're reiterating today does not factor in any potential strategic changes arising from hiring a new CEO. As Brian mentioned earlier, we will need to realign the organization in order to support and execute our updated strategy. We also plan to carefully analyze underperforming assets during the second quarter. \nThis organizational review and the asset review will likely entail some onetime costs in 2018 that are too early to quantify. But these initiatives are intended to support and strengthen our economic model and set us up to execute our strategic plan and deliver long-term shareholder value. We'll share more details with you later this quarter. \nWe're encouraged by our first quarter results, and we're optimistic about the direction we're headed. We're confident that the changes we're making to our leadership and the realignment of our organization will enable us to be more nimble and more innovative in all areas: customer access, digital, menu and the restaurant environment, and it will allow us to execute better to deliver on our commitments to our guests, our employees and our shareholders. \nWe look forward to sharing more details about our plans at the special investor call, which will be scheduled sometime before our Q2 earnings call. Operator, we'll now open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Nicole Miller from Piper Jaffray.\nAnalysts: Jack, a quick one for you. Could you reiterate CapEx? You're going pretty quick through the numbers, I just wanted to check that. I wanted to check that real quick and then ask Brian a quick question.\nExecutives: Yes, Nicole, the CapEx right now we expect will be about the same as we outlined on the last call. It's going to be in the neighborhood of $300 million. About 1/3 of that is new stores. The other 2/3 is existing stores. The big items there is the refresh that we talked about, which is about $50 million. Another big piece was about $25 million for the digitized second make-line, and then there's another number of other things that we outlined in the last call, but those are still intact now. Nicole, just like I mentioned, our guidance hasn't taken into account the impact of strategy. It's possible that we may refine that or adjust that throughout the year and we'll give you a full recap on any changes when we talk to you before the next earnings call.\nAnalysts: And then, Brian, just a good -- a big-picture question for you, and thanks for your time. Do you see this as a recovery story or a global growth opportunity? Just curious how you see this playing out long term. And you talked about 5 pieces that you want to execute. Can you give us any little detail before the next call on maybe some of the low hanging fruit versus longer-term solutions?\nExecutives: Yes. Sure, Nicole. First, I think the opportunity is clearly a recovery story in the U.S. and we'll be focused on chasing what I believe is a powerful brand that has really strong economics, strong purpose that when we tie the elements that I outlined in my earlier comments and we'll go into much further detail on our special call, I think the opportunity is really exciting for what this brand has in front of it. The innovation will be across the business, as I mentioned, in access, digital, menu and frankly, we'll double down on our fundamentals. So I think the story of recovery, and then where that recovery takes us, I think, is also really exciting, but that's a much longer-term discussion.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Tarantino from Robert W. Baird & Company.\nAnalysts: Brian, just a couple of questions kind of high-level, how you're thinking about how this plays out over the next few years. Are you thinking, I guess, directionally that you're going to need to make a lot of investments in the business? I know you talked about realigning the structure, but do you think there's going to be a big step-up in expenses related to that? And then secondly, I know Jack mentioned next year you would open a similar number of units or maybe a little higher, but how are you thinking about unit growth as you execute this turnaround strategy? Do you think you need to slow or moderate the unit growth in the out-years to accomplish what you envisioned?\nExecutives: Okay. Thanks, David. Your first question, I think we can get into all the details of how we see the plan playing out forward. I think some of the good news is though, as I look into the business, like a great area of focus that people have been asking me about is our marketing spend. I think the marketing spend is one of those areas that we believe there's a lot of opportunity to take those dollars that we're currently allocating and make the brand much more visible with what we have. And then we're going to put in place more of a test-and-learn approach on the initiatives that we'll roll out. So we'll have clarity on what we believe the return is for the investment that we're making before we make those decisions to go beyond our current plans. So I think the recovery plan that we'll be putting in place or as I talked about earlier, our path to performance will be based on leveraging the idea of testing and proving out propositions while at the same token, with our organization, rebuild capability and restructure to support the strategy that I believe will set us up for growth in the near term and longer term. Your second question regarding units, the good news is the economics of the units that we're opening continue to look very strong. And as mentioned in the script, we see no reason for us to change the pace that we are experiencing this year. And obviously, as we to get further into our plan, we'll give the appropriate updates as the time permits when it's right to do that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore from AllianceBernstein.\nAnalysts: Congratulations, Brian, on the new role. I wanted to ask you if I may, one is about the quarter that just passed and then now sort of going forward. So in terms of the quarter that just passed, I guess I was surprised that what appears to be a fairly quick impact you might be having, a couple of things that you've seen or maybe new creative around marketing and then a waste management initiative that looks like it has some pretty big opportunities in terms of in-restaurant waste management. So I guess from my perspective, to what extent is this you, Brian, kind of putting your stamp already on that? And do you see a lot of low hanging fruit like what some of these initiatives seem to suggest just in terms of sort of basic systematic approaches? So that was question one. And then question two, if you could just talk a little bit about what you meant by consumer meaningful innovation across the business in the context of what's always been a very simple, straightforward menu and the operations that go with that.\nExecutives: Yes. Sure. So first, obviously, thank you for the kind words. Very excited to be in the CEO role of Chipotle. It's loaded with opportunity, which I think is what you're asking about. And what I'll tell you is in the short term, I think there are real opportunities for us to make simple pivots to increase, I think the appeal of our brand to those customers that are already very much big fans. One of the big surprises for me, frankly, even once it got announced that I was taking this role was the amount of people that reached out to saying how much love Chipotle and they love the food. And I think just with the most recent advertising, we made a little pivot towards reminding people what is great about the ingredients. This Food with Integrity purpose really resonates and reminding people why they feel good about eating Chipotle, I think, is always a good approach. So you'll continue to see us make simple pivots like that while we also continue to push this brand forward in a big way from the standpoint of access as it relates to digital innovation, menu as it relates to menu innovation that leverages our operating model, which I believe is something very special in this industry. And it allows us to do a lot of exciting things, whether it's dayparts or simple menu tweaks that I think will broaden the appeal. And then, obviously, I think you're kind of mentioning your question about waste management and such. Look, there's always opportunity to be better on the cost side, and we're going to continue to look for those opportunities along the way because that's just frees up the ability to give the customer more of what they want and our team members a better experience to provide the experience we want them to provide. So lots of opportunities I think in the short term. We're going to be very cognizant of what are the things we pace in sequence in the near term and what are the things we put into test to ensure we're focusing on the right things over the next 18 to 24 months.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia from William Blair.\nAnalysts: Jack, a quick question on the restaurant-level margin. I know you beat by a good amount in the first quarter. I think some of that, as you mentioned with marketing, will catch up as the year goes on. Are you still looking for 17.5 to 18.5 for the year? And then longer term, I guess with -- Brian, with your leadership, I mean how do you think about the long-term restaurant-level margin at Chipotle as you talk about new dayparts balancing the sales versus margin?\nExecutives: Yes, Sharon, on the margin range, we had a very nice quarter. It was aided by lower marketing. The good news is, Brian and Chris to the extent they came in and were able to look at what marketing was doing, they were able to redirect dollars so they weren't spent. And so that's kind of dry powder. So that's dry powder that we have for future quarters. I think that's a very good thing. I would say the range is 17.5 to 18.5, now appears quite conservative. I don't know that I would change it. I think what I'd do is we're going to probably hit for the year at the high end of that. Could we beat it slightly? Sure. I just wouldn't want to call it a victory just yet. But getting out of the gate this strong does show that we have some great margin potential. And then you wanted to know how the margin potential going forward. If you want general margin potential, Sharon, I can answer that. I still think that our margins are going to be highly contingent around volume. Like, for example, if we're in this 18.5% to 19% or so for this year, if we get up to $2.2 million volume, we can do a 22% margin. If we get to a $2.4 million volume, we can do a 24% margin. So really, the biggest lever to pull is bringing more customers in. And we bring more customers in, we know that our model levers up pretty significantly.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Glass from Morgan Stanley.\nAnalysts: Two questions. One is when you look at the brand and you've looked at it from afar, and now you're looking at it from the inside, how do you think about the price/value relationship in this business versus when you came from? Is there an opportunity, for example, to broaden the price/value relationships so you can capture more customers? Or are you happy with kind of the price/value? So think about just how you're thinking about that price/value equation for the brand going forward. And maybe just secondly, in your mind, what's the right time frame for us to look at your initiatives that you're contemplating and how they're going to play out? In other words, is this a year of investment and the impact is really felt in '19? Or do you think there can be some meaningful impact and changes inside of 2018?\nExecutives: Look, here's what I would tell you is the value proposition at Chipotle is tremendously strong. And now with that said, we will always be looking for innovation that continues to enhance that value proposition. The most important thing I think you can do for a healthy value proposition is you should never get complacent on where you stand. So we will be on the side of the consumer, making sure that we give them the value proposition that excites them to come back over and over again. So all these initiatives we'll be talking about, one of the ways that you make sure it's consumer relevant is it rings the bell for our customer on that value proposition, whether that value proposition takes place in mobile, digital, loyalty, menu, access, those are all important things. So that's the one piece. Your second question about time line, look, here's what I would tell you is as opportunities present themselves, we will walk through those opportunities to grow the business. As we find opportunities that yield even bigger benefits, through testing and learning and iterating, those things will probably take a little bit longer, but I think there are simple wins on our way to our path to what I think is going to be really accelerated opportunities in the future. So that's how I think about it. It's really a combination of both. We'll find some singles on our way to finding home runs.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Karen Holthouse from Goldman Sachs.\nAnalysts: So obviously, looking forward to the call that we're going to get in a month or 2 months with some more detail on this. But thinking about that call, is that something that's really going to be focused on where there are opportunities at the margin level or to drive sales? Or should we be also thinking about there's going to be discussion of any sort of more structural changes, whether that's the balance sheet is refranchising something that you're considering? How should we think about kind of what's on the table or topics for a discussion there?\nExecutives: Yes. What I would tell is we're going to use that special call the opportunity to give clarity even further into the strategy, the structure necessary to execute that strategy and what those key focus areas are to put Chipotle on the path to performance that we believe is highly attainable. So it will be comprehensive, and I think you'll find it will be choiceful. And I think there is power in simplicity, power in choice and power in a focused organization. So obviously, it will be a comprehensive discussion and the good news is we'll have our entire leadership team present to be able to really discuss our path forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays.\nAnalysts: Two things, one, just on the comp recovery, maybe from an outsider or actually most recently, a competitor's perspective, I'm just wondering, in your view, what do you think has been the greatest impediment to the Chipotle recovery over the past couple of years? Hence, I guess which of these initiatives you're talking about will be the most impactful, I guess, is a different way to look at it? And then the second question, which is on the fact that you came from Taco Bell, which obviously has left the laterals. But the one thing that's quite different is Taco Bell, being close to 100% franchise model, now you're 100% company-operated model. Just wondering, qualitatively, how does the approach differ, when you look at this just pros and cons to the franchising versus the company operated side? I'm just wondering, as you now come into your new role, how you have to think about things differently in that perspective.\nExecutives: Yes, sure. Look, I think to answer your first question, Chipotle, smartly, under Scott Boatwright's leadership, has refocused the fundamentals in running these restaurants. We've put clarity into roles. We've put focus on throughput, and we've also put high expectations on the guest experience and the food experience we're going to provide. Those fundamentals are critical whether you own the restaurants or whether you franchise them to people. So there really is no trade-off in what are the fundamentals to having a great restaurant? The only thing that I think Scott has done very well is he has put in a culture of accountability and a culture where people know they can count on each other to train, support and grow. And I think that is a foundational element for any upside that we will experience in this business. We can never lose sight on running great restaurants and having great people that lead those restaurants and supporting them with a wonderful culture and tremendous opportunities. So that's the first piece. The second piece is, I think the brand has been invisible. So I think if you combine great fundamentals in the restaurant with now a visible brand that has a powerful purpose and really craveable food, it's a recipe for a lot of opportunity that can play well in the way the customers want to eat food today and I believe how they want to eat food in the future. So I'm tremendously excited about the fundamentals that we are maniacally focused on, coupled with identifying how we make this brand much more visible and get a narrative back out there in explaining what makes our brand different, what makes our brand connect with people, feel good about the way they eat and live and why they still feel great about carrying the badge of Chipotle with them. And I think you had a question on franchising? We see no need to go down that path right now, given the economic model that we have and the returns that we get with building new restaurants so -- but thanks for the question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bittner from Oppenheimer & Co.\nAnalysts: I have 2 questions for you guys, both on just how you're thinking about the asset base. As you talk about an asset base review, first of all, is there an additional smell test you're doing on the unit economic threshold required to earn the right to stay in the asset base that you can talk to us about? And then, Brian, you talked about looking at your unit base and improving the accessibility of it. Could the implementation of drive-throughs play a role in the accessibility strategy, where it makes sense? Or is accessibility really just focused solely on digital? And I ask that question just in the spirit of where you came from, obviously seeing the benefits of drive-throughs.\nExecutives: Brian, I'll address the first question on the asset base. We haven't changed our threshold for what is the higher-returning asset. What we're looking at though is we had a number of restaurants that, before the drop in sales, were strong cash flows, strong returning stores. We opened a number of restaurants during a tough period where we got off to a slow start. So our asset review is going to look at all the restaurants that are clear underperformers, and these will be negative cash flow stores. So we're not looking at stores that are positive cash flow that the return is a little underperforming. We're going to look at stores that -- restaurants that are not cash flowing that maybe we picked the wrong site, maybe they got off to a wrong start and made a bad first impression and it's going to be difficult, if not impossible, to change that. And to give you an order of magnitude, the review while we're still in the middle of it, we're looking at something less than 100 restaurants. So it's not a huge list of restaurants but that's kind of the total population that we're looking at. We'll review each and every one of them, and we'll look at the whole story from a financial standpoint, from a real estate standpoint, from a what kind of first impression do we make. And then we'll make some very careful choices about what to do with the assets.\nExecutives: This is Brian. So your second question with regard to access, look, I think innovation in access, obviously, you are not surprised by the idea that, look, digital is a key piece of the puzzle, right, whether it's through the mobile access, delivery as access, also kiosk as access, catering as access. I mean I love the list that I'm rattling off here. The trick for us is figuring out what comes first and how we prioritize it accordingly. Now drive-throughs, I think, are an interesting proposition for Chipotle as an element. It will be something that will definitely part of our access innovation program. But that's -- in the scheme of what's going to happen in the very near-term versus what's more of a longer-term access innovation play, drive-through would fall further on that longer-term scale.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Matt McGinley from Evercore ISI.\nAnalysts: First question is on the -- for Jack, first is what you guided in February on the restaurant margin, it came in about 3 to 3.5 points better than expected. And we can see what is going to happen over the course of the year with COGS and labor expense, but a lot of that came from other operating expenses in this quarter. And I know that 150 bps was related to the ad spend shifts. So I'm curious what else in that line item would look better over the course of the year. Is that just not doing maintenance? Is there something else that is just looking better than you anticipated in that line item?\nExecutives: Well, thanks, Matt. The food costs behave really well. Avocados were something that took out a bite out of our margins last year. They got better late in the fourth quarter, and then they got better again. And you just talk about avocados, it's kind of almost every year. It has a big impact when it goes up and down. Nearly 50% of our transactions include guacamole. And so when prices shoot up, which by the way, they shot up from something below $30 a case to nearly $80 a case for part of the fourth quarter. So they've come back to kind of normal prices. If they stay at normal prices, we should have a decent food cost during the year. Labor is kind of the same story in terms of wage inflation continues. We expect it to continue and so the guidance I gave you, I think, is very reasonable guidance. So I think we got off to a great start. I think the comments that Brian made about Scott and the field -- our field team did a great job of managing food cost to the extent that it was their job to order the right amount of food and control food waste and things like that. They did a great job. They've done a great job managing labor as well. So I think we're off to a great start. I think if we keep these kind of controls, the next big surprise or additive thing would be additional sales. And so if some of the things that Brian mentioned go into test, and they test well and if we put those into more restaurant and we get more sales, we know we have the ability to leverage our margins when we bring more customers in, and that would be a nice thing to report.\nAnalysts: Got it. So Brian, I've heard a lot really from external people that when you look at the supply chain that Chipotle has versus other restaurant chains that just the way the food is prepped and the way that it is -- it flows through that supply chain, it always makes it harder to innovate Chipotle versus other chains. Having been to other restaurant chains, do you feel that there's a big factor that sort of limits your innovation at that company? Or do you see it as kind of green fields and there's a lot that you can do?\nExecutives: Yes, thanks for question. Look, I actually think the -- I'll break up your comment. I guess supply chain, meaning the ingredients that we use, I see no barrier to innovation. If anything, I'd see this great ingredients to be able to further distance ourselves from other restaurant alternatives. And then from a standpoint of then finishing that ingredient in the restaurant, it is a really powerful model. I mean if there's one thing that I'm really impressed by is the throughput capability of this line is something really special and unique. And I actually think it's an advantage to figure out how to do innovation that can build from a throughput machine. I don't think there are many places where you can say, well, I can have that great food done at that speed and then we can innovate on that foundation or that platform. And you'll see when we're talking about some of the innovations we're talking about, it just takes advantage of what I believe is a competitive advantage. So I think we're going to be able to innovate and distance ourselves and really put ourselves into what I believe is something very special that will delight customers and give our team members the ability to execute flawlessly.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andy Barish from Jefferies.\nAnalysts: Yes, I was wondering on that, actually, follow-up on a couple of those comments if there is some throughput data you're willing to share kind of currently versus a year ago. And then secondly, on innovation, not only supply chain, but just the physical plant and now the need for second make-lines. Is the space constraints make it more difficult to innovate? Or is that sort of an outmoded thought and there's ways to work around that with your fresh-eyes view on the business now?\nExecutives: Yes, thanks for the question, because the second make-line is actually a huge enabler for our business to take throughput to the next level, frankly. And the reason is we put digital capability into 250-plus restaurants, but the fact that we already have the second make-line physically there in all our restaurants is a huge opportunity for us to both innovate as well as drive throughput even further on our consumer-facing line as well as our second make-line. That second make-line has some efficiencies that we are delighted that we have in place because as we dial up the innovation in digital and we dial up that off-premise access, it presents a great opportunity for us to really enhance our throughput on both fronts.\nAnalysts: And then any throughput numbers you're willing to share or is it a little early for that?\nExecutives: Look, we can probably get into those details, Scott. It will be available as part of the special call we're going to do. And we're happy to take you through that then.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe from JPMorgan.\nAnalysts: Brian, talk about how you guys put in both fourth meal or the so-called late-night daypart as well as breakfast. And you've mentioned daypart a couple of different times and I was wondering what that could potentially mean at Chipotle whether it's different products at different times of the day, which can happen certainly within any quick service or fast casual type of format and whether it's possible to have breakfast without a drive-through or maybe you could put breakfast in just the dense urban stores while not necessarily putting them in suburban stores. Just thinking about what kind of potential you think dayparts really mean to the brand at this point.\nExecutives: Yes, sure. Look, I think one of the things that's really exciting about the daypart opportunity for Chipotle is today, we're opening at 10:30, 10:45, and we're closing roughly around 10:00 p.m. And there's opportunities to expand those hours and leverage our existing food and our existing platform in a very seamless fashion. Then you look at the obvious dayparts within those extended hours, and you quickly see where there's opportunity where we have some downtime where frankly I think with some marketing and some product innovation, we could turn those downtimes into transaction-driving times. So as I think about it right now, there is daypart expansion opportunity with our current model, and you layer on some menu innovation coupled with some marketing communication, I see a real ability to drive the existing platform in those dayparts without having to take the step today all the way through breakfast, introducing a whole new food platform. So that's where our thinking is today, not to say that in the future you may not even expand those hours further, and you need to think about new food platforms but that's not in the plan right now.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Palmer from RBC Capital Markets.\nAnalysts: Brian, first, a question on consumer scores, i.e., you mentioned something about becoming more consumer-centric. What is the consumer telling you about Chipotle today and the opportunities to improve perhaps in ways that you see in the brand deteriorated in those scores and just in ways that you just feel like it's underachieving. And that separately, just building on that last thing that you mentioned, the operating model. Everyone's always assumed that Chipotle's operating model because you have those limited number of wells in front of us, it doesn't have the ability to handle new menu news or even use price because of that simple menu, and those are 2 tools that you used with great effect in the past. And so I think people are having a hard time understanding how you're going to use those going forward. So those 2 -- that comment would be helpful as well.\nExecutives: Sure. So on your first question regarding the consumer, what we see is a real opportunity to make the brand more visible and be more top of mind with people to remind them why they love Chipotle. When you remind people about the fact that they buy into this idea of food integrity, cultivating a better world, they instantly feel better about the food they're eating. And we make good on that promise. So I think there's a real opportunity to be much more visible on why you want to be connected to this brand, why you believe in this brand. And based on the information I'm seeing, that resonates with how people want to eat today and how they will want to eat in the future. Look, there's also huge opportunities to get people access. One of our biggest complaints, frankly, is access to the brand. The brand is not that convenient. I know we have 2,400 stores, almost 2,500 stores. We, as a result, are not that convenient to people. So you've got people saying, hey, when can I do mobile ordering? When can I do delivery? When can I get Chipotle to me? And the good news is more than, I think, 50% people don't even realize that we started to do these things. So there is tremendous opportunity of educating people on why they should feel good about the brand, why they will love the food, why it's craveable, because it gives them all the customization, the abundance that they're looking for with the ingredients that they want. And then you combine that with now giving them more access and getting food to them on their terms. It's a really exciting proposition. Your second question on our ability to innovate, the line has flexibility so long as we first test and understand the demand that we're generating. If we prepare ourselves for what is going to happen, Scott and his operators will be capable to use our supply chain and our operating model to execute and meet consumers' expectations. Where you run into problems is when you get ahead of a forecast. And one of the things we're going to put in place here is when we are working on innovation, we're going to pilot that innovation so that we can have a prediction of what's going to happen and prepare the operating model accordingly to support it. So I'm very optimistic about opportunities that just leverage, getting more access to what Chipotle is today, and then you add some innovation, and I think you broaden the appeal. And we have predictability of what that's going to perform, Scott and the operators will be able to execute.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Gregory Francfort from Bank of America.\nAnalysts: I have 2 questions, the first for Brian. Have you looked at portion sizing and your thoughts on whether or not consumers are paying you for your portion sizes now, or if there's an opportunity to take that either up or down? And then I think you had also talked about employee turnover coming down recently. Any metrics around that? And what do you think is driving that? Have you made any changes on the training front? Or -- because the industry has been going up and so that would be kind of impressive, I guess I'm wondering what you guys are doing differently.\nExecutives: Sure. So the piece on employee turnover, I think that's a testament to Scott, putting clarity of what you're supposed to be doing in your role, how you support each other then in the restaurant and then providing clarity of how you can grow in this organization. And look, people like to stay in places where they believe they're appreciated and they have the opportunity to grow. And that's the culture that we're putting into the restaurant, and I think that's why you're seeing our turnover move down. And it's really exciting because the more we can push that turnover down, the more we don't find ourselves retraining the organization and we execute better. It's that simple. So Marissa, who's new to the team, she's going to be laser focused on how we drive this culture and training all the way through the restaurant while Scott partners with her to take from a culture of accountability to also a culture of growth. And I think if you've put those 2 things together, you will feel highly appreciated and believe that there's a future for them at Chipotle. What was your first question?\nAnalysts: The first question was just on portion sizing. And if you looked at whether -- yes.\nExecutives: Yes, yes. So look, one of the things clearly that people love about Chipotle is the customization proposition, and we're going to continue to figure out how we get more consistent in our execution for people so that they don't feel like they got too much this time or they got too little. So one of the things that I love about the experiences -- and the consumer knows is we're a place that wants to give them the experience that they're after with their food. And that's not going to change. So if people want a little more, we'll try to give them a little more. They want a little less, we'll give them a little less. But regardless, whether they're asking for a little more or a little less, one of the things Scott is focused on is how do you continue to get more consistent so people feel like they're getting the experience they got the last time as well as the experience they can count on for the next time. So that's where we're focused on, is how do we get more consistent with that experience. But we're never going to tell the consumer you can't ask us for a little more or a little less.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Charles from Cowen and Company.\nAnalysts: Longer-term question for Brian and a short-term one for Jack. So Brian, as you think about the road ahead, can you help us compare and contrast the starting points? When you look at Taco Bell in 2011 and Chipotle in 2017, what do you think of the different factors at play here that helped shape the turnaround, if you will? And then Jack, you mentioned as well, you see more comp trends that continued in April. How are you framing that? Just is that looking on a geometric 3-year, or how should we think about that perhaps just for simplicity? If you disclose the number, it might be helpful.\nExecutives: So why don't I go first and I'll hand it over to you, Jack. So here's what I believe for Chipotle. I believe the brand has been invisible. And I think as the brand becomes visible and we lead culture, that's going to be a huge opportunity going forward. This brand needs to be leading culture, not reacting to it. And the people that are loyal to this brand, that's what they want to be a part of. The other piece that is very exciting about this company is, look, there's limited innovation happening in small scale, and the opportunity for us is how do we take some of that innovation to pilot it and get it to a place where we can now do it at scale. And the opportunities, we talked about a few of them, right? They go from access to digital, to menu, even the restaurant design opportunities going forward. That is huge opportunity. A brand that has a lot of relevance, that's culturally right and leading, coupled with innovation, built on strong fundamentals that give people great food at a fast experience at a great value, I like the future. I really get excited about that because those are things that I think, as we put together this leadership team here with Chris and Scott and Marissa and Jack and Curt and Laurie, it is mission one to make this brand visible. And right next to it is be culturally relevant. So all the innovation and the fundamentals that we've put in place are going to, I think, attract people not only to work here but attract people to continue to be our loyal customers. And that's why I'm going to tell you about the long term.\nExecutives: And Andrew, in terms of what I looked at when I made the comments about April. We look at dollar trends. We looked at what our expectations were based on what we expect with the Easter shift, what normal seasonality would bring. The weather definitely hit us during parts of the month. I'm sure that's not a surprise to you. From a comp standpoint, we looked at it mainly from a 1-year comp standpoint. If you're going to do multiple years, you have to go back to 3. A 2-year trend will not give you anything meaningful. '16 and '17 lined up. '16 was a step down. '17 was a step up. So if you wanted to do a 3-year layer, you're probably get in the same ballpark. But for purposes of what we did, we just kept it very, very simple. Looked at April, compared to where our previous trends were. And underneath it all, it looks like the trends were very similar when you factor weather out.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Will Slabaugh from Stephens Inc.\nAnalysts: On the 5% pricing and then maybe more specifically on longer-term pricing plans, in general, I realize it's been a while since Chipotle have taken any meaningful pricing, but 5%, obviously, a decent ways ahead of where the rest of the industry is. So I'm curious, number one, if you plan to change the strategy to be more consistent in terms of low price increases; and number two, if you see any material difference in customer pushback to the pricing. In some of markets that we've talked about as being lower performing markets in recent years or if that 20% level that you talked about earlier has been fairly consistent?\nExecutives: Yes. Every 3-year pricing -- we've done it kind of 3 times in a row now, it's not necessarily strategy that we say, okay, no more price increases for the next 3 years. It just kind of happened. This past time, we didn't want to do it while we're trying to bring customers back into the restaurant. Before that, labor emplacement was very tame, and so we had strong comps and so we can lever our margin without resorting to pricing. It's a powerful advantage to have if you can continue to build your model, continue to expand leverage without constantly increasing menu prices, and so we took advantage of that luxury. Going forward, we're going to do what we need to do. And if that means doing smaller more regular price increases, we're certainly open to that. If we can lever our model, if we get the top line going and we lever the model without a price increase, we think we can drive greater value to the customer. Customers always love it when they get greater value. So we're not going to predetermine what and when we will do anything with pricing, but we're open to doing something other than kind of a 3-year cadence. And in terms of the resistance, we just don't see much resistance across the company. The only time we've seen it and we've seen it in the past as well, we see it a bit on the West Coast, and that's it. Otherwise, so there's the company, our customers, think we provide a great value. And value is not just based on price. It's based on high-quality ingredients. It's based on a lot of food. It's based on an environment that they enjoy. And it's actually the value that we bring is the harder thing to bring based on food, based on environment, based on the overall experience. Price is something that our consumers, sure would they like to play -- pay -- who wouldn't? But when they come to Chipotle and they get a great experience in a nice restaurant, the food is delicious, they call that a great value.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris O'Cull from Stifel.\nAnalysts: First, Jack, I apologize if I missed it, but what was the traffic decline in the quarter? And then secondly, Brian, several of the opportunities you mentioned to improve access for the brand seemed to make -- could take some time to build. But are there opportunities to quickly address the traffic declines you're seeing?\nExecutives: I'll answer around the traffic. The comp came from an increase in average check and you can take the 5% price increase. It's less than 20%, but just rounded up to 20%, that added for queso added too, so you can back into the transaction impact was. So it would be at the 3.3% or so range, 3.3%, 3.5%, something like that, so that's the underlying traffic.\nExecutives: And then to answer your question on what was my belief on the transaction opportunity going forward? Look, I think that's a real opportunity and one of the things that Chris and the marketing organization are going to be centered on. And the good news is I believe the combination of the brand visibility, the innovation that I talked about, I think there are opportunities in the near term that we can start putting into place, putting into action that make it a material impact on our transactions. And then over time, you'll see the culmination of all these things coming together, I think, play even bigger impact on the transactions and the number of people coming into our restaurants. So it's really a combination of the digital, the menu, the access, programs like loyalty. Those are all things that are going to be centered on making sure we are driving transactions as part of the proposition.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Strelzik from BMO Capital Markets.\nAnalysts: Over the last couple of years, there's been a shift in focus at different points in time, trying to bring back sales among existing customers at some points and finding new customers at some points. I'm just wondering, Brian, do you think about the opportunity set in that way, think of the customer base in that way? And if so, where do you see the greatest opportunities over the next 6, 12, 24 months?\nExecutives: Yes, look, here's what we know about our customers. Every age cohort loves Chipotle, okay? And we overindex with young people. And this brand is a youthful spirit. It's a challenger, right? It's breaking convention of what accessible food done fast is. And that appeals broadly. So our goal is not to be exclusive. Our goal is to be inclusive, and our goal is to drive transactions with a youthful spirit, a meaningful positioning and continue to leverage the strength of being a youthful brand that connects with youth. So that's how I look at it. Obviously, Chris and I are digging deep into it because we need to understand the reasons why you either slow down or increase your usage with us. And then we want to make sure we understand why all these different age cohorts are excited about being in the Chipotle business. Our goal is every category buyer could come in Chipotle. That's simple. We probably won't get all of them in the near term, but I'm going to try in the long term.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brett Levy from Deutsche Bank.\nAnalysts: If you could share a little bit, Jack, this question is for you on the margins. You mentioned that you think you can get to the high end of the 17.5, 18.5 range, and then you said you could possibly exceed it. But you also mentioned earlier that nothing is really being built into the plan with respect to what Brian's integration and those ideas can have. Can you just balance between what you were saying because it sounded like you said it's going to be without any implementation of Brian's strategies, but it also sounded like you were talking about assuming additional sales?\nExecutives: Yes, I think you heard it right. We reiterated our guidance, that comps would be in the low single digits. So the margin comments deal with that assumption, to the extent we have strategies that go through pilot and are worthy of a rollout, meaning we expect to get a return on our investment. That's not included in the comp. It's just too early to know what those things might be or what the magnitude might be so this is kind of a base case, if you will.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session, and I would like to turn the call back over to Coralie for closing remarks.\nExecutives: Thank you for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our special call in late Q2. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.\nOperator: Greetings, and welcome to the Chipotle Mexican Grill First Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Coralie Witter.\nExecutives: Hello, everyone, and welcome to our call today. By now, you should have access to our earnings announcement released this afternoon for the first quarter of 2018. It may also be found on our website at chipotle.com in the Investor Relations section.\nBefore we begin our presentation, I will remind everyone that parts of our discussion today will include forward-looking statements as defined in the securities laws. These forward-looking statements will include: statements regarding our strategy and initiative to build sales; sales trends and forecasts for future comparable restaurant sales; expected new restaurant openings; estimates of future food, labor, occupancy, marketing, other operating and general and administrative cost trends; statements about our expected effective tax rate; plans for capital expenditures and stock repurchases as well as other statements of our expectations and plans.\nThese statements are based on information available to us today, and we are not assuming any obligation to update them. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. We refer you to the Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K as updated in our subsequent Form 10-Qs for discussion of these risks.\nI'd also like to remind everyone that we've adopted a self-imposed quiet period, restricting communications with investors during that period. The quiet period will begin on the 16th day of the last month of each fiscal quarter and continues until the next earnings conference call. For the second quarter of 2018, it will begin June 16 and continue through our second quarter earnings release. \nOur discussion today will also include non-GAAP financial measures, a reconciliation of which can be found on the Presentations page of the Investor Relations section of our website. We will start today's call with some brief prepared remarks from Brian Niccol, Chief Executive Officer; and Jack Hartung, Chief Financial Officer. We will allow plenty of time at the end of those remarks for questions. In the room and also available during the Q&A period are: Scott Boatwright, Chief Restaurant Officer; Chris Brandt, Chief Marketing Officer; Laurie Schalow, Chief communications Officer; and Marissa Andrada, Chief Human Administrations Officer. \nWith that, I will now turn the call over to Brian Niccol.\nExecutives: Thanks, Coralie, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm excited to be talking to you today on my first earnings call with Chipotle. Chipotle is such a strong brand with incredible equity built over the last 25 years, and I couldn't be more excited about our future. One thing is very clear to me: consumers love our great-tasting food and appreciate that our food is made with integrity. I have admired Chipotle for many years, and I'm excited to have the opportunity to lead the future direction of this incredible company. \nBefore I get into details of this call, I'd like to start by recognizing Steve Ells for creating this amazing concept and for the last 25 years, leading it to becoming one of the most important restaurant brands of our time. I thank Steve for the invaluable time he's spent bringing me up to speed over the past several weeks, and I deeply appreciate him fully handing over the reins to me and giving me the autonomy to lead, innovate and create a new strategy that will ensure our growth for the future. Going forward, Steve has embraced his new role as Executive Chairman. We are fortunate to be able to leverage his creativity and expertise as a culinarian, a visionary and our founder. \nFor those of you who don't know me very well, I'd like to share some of my key beliefs and leadership principles so you know what to expect going forward. I believe it is important to focus on results over activity, to hold people accountable and to be stewards of our business. I believe in the power of innovation and that to be successful, we must create and lead change. I also believe in a winning work ethic and that to win, we need to have an external focus with the ability to quickly read and react to change. And I believe in the power of people so it's important to me that we create a culture that is focused on running and supporting great restaurants, putting the customer first, living our purpose, innovating for today and tomorrow and supporting and recognizing each other. \nBefore I share my view on what changes we need to make, I thought I would start by telling you what is not going to change. We will continue to serve high-quality great-tasting food that consumers crave. We will also continue to focus on improving operations and fixing and modernizing the foundation of our company. With that said, you will see us doubling down on our purpose and our guest experience. We will get better at innovation and putting customers front and center. We will focus on execution which rests on simple choices, clear goals and consistent measures. \nWe are also upgrading our capabilities to innovate across our business. Specifically, we will provide greater consumer access including through delivery and catering, enhance the digital experience, innovate around our menu and improve our restaurant design. \nWe're working on building a world-class executive team and an organization built for growth. In the last year, we've added new leaders across operations, communications, marketing and human resources. Since our last earnings announcement, we added Chris Brandt as Chief Marketing Officer and just this week, Marissa Andrada joined Chipotle as Chief Human Resources Officer. \nChris Brandt is a seasoned veteran and is quickly assessing the changes needed across marketing so we can get back to emphasizing the craveability of our food and expanding brand loyalty among consumers. Having worked with Chris in the past, I can vouch for his proven track record of delivering innovation that is good for consumers and operations and that provides the financial outcomes needed to grow transactions and sales. I'm confident Chris will quickly find ways to increase our brand relevance and ensure our advertising spend is working harder for us. \nMarissa Andrada has extensive experience in senior human resource roles and prominent consumer brands, and I'm excited that she has joined our team. Marissa's leadership will be essential as we look to strengthen our organization and ensure we have the right structure and capabilities to achieve our strategy and build a culture of innovation and recognition. \nWe are creating a path to performance, and we're in the process of establishing the strategies to get there. I plan to share more details with you on a special call before our next earnings announcement with more details around how we will do these 5 things: first, grow sales transactions, margin and restaurants; second, elevate our brand relevance and further our brand purpose; third, build the right structure and capabilities to sustain performance; fourth, create a people recognition and innovation culture; and fifth, run great restaurants that deliver best-in-class financial performance. In the coming months, you will see us piloting various tests across key innovation focus areas such as consumer access, the digital experience, our menu and restaurant experience in realigning the organization to support the go-forward strategy. \nI do want to acknowledge that there's a lot of great work underway, and we are starting to get some traction. Curt Garner's work on the mobile app is paying dividends, and I'm excited about the continued benefits of the digitally enhanced second make-line, which is now in 237 restaurants. Order accuracy has improved in those restaurants, leading to a nearly 20% improvement in customer feedback. Digital sales are our fastest growing area with growth of 20% year-over-year and now represent 8.8% of sales in the first quarter. \nThe customer experience with mobile sales is also improving as our average wait times for mobile orders are down by more than 1/2 since launching Smarter Pickup Times. Curt and I are excited to continue driving progress in these areas, which we believe will help us bring Chipotle to more people in ways that customers appreciate. \nWe are seeing improvements in operations under Scott Boatwright's leadership. I've spent a lot of time in restaurants with Scott over the last several weeks, and I'm impressed with our teams and their dedication to operational excellence. The plans Scott put in place last fall have created a culture of accountability in the field. Our design to provide a great guest experience and are built on a strong foundation of food safety. Most importantly, our customers are noticing, and I'm confident we are focused on the right measures. We have a lot of work ahead of us, but I'm optimistic about the future of Chipotle. We have a strong economic model, a loyal customer base and a powerful purpose.\nWith that, I look forward to sharing more details with you on the special call I mentioned earlier. Now I'll turn the call over to Jack Hartung to provide a financial update.\nExecutives: Thanks, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased with our performance in the first quarter as comp sales accelerated slightly, margins expanded and earnings per share grew. And though it was a solid quarter, we realize we have much more work ahead. Since Brian's arrival, we've been taking a fresh look at every element of our business. We're committed to running great restaurants, putting our customers first, staying true to our purpose, embracing innovation in menu, digital, access in restaurants, improving our execution capabilities and strengthening our culture internally. We're confident that these are the right areas of focus to drive strong performance and increase shareholder value on a sustainable long-term basis. \nBefore I go through the financial results, I want to highlight some important operational accomplishments this quarter. As Brian mentioned, Scott's plan to instill a culture of accountability in field is starting to get the attention of our customers, as internal customer satisfaction scores have increased significantly since last summer. Employee turnover at the crew level has improved to the best levels we've seen in many years. We have much more to do, but the culture of accountability, the heightened focus on training and the improved leadership structure in the field is beginning to drive results that are precursors to sustained comp sales improvement. \nBrian highlighted a strong improvement in our digital sales, which grew 20% year-over-year and now accounts for 8.8% of total sales. Mobile sales alone grew 41% year-over-year. And these orders are all fulfilled on our second make-line, which we believe to be a competitive advantage and that we will continue to invest in to make the customer experience as convenient as possible, allowing us to continue to grow digital sales. \nThe majority of second make-line orders are app and web orders but also include third party delivery orders and catering. The surge in mobile sales since relaunching our app late last year gives us confidence that our customers appreciate the great experience. We're proud to say that we were notified just this week that we won the People's Choice Webby Award for best user interface for mobile app. The Webby is an award for excellence on the Internet and is one of the most prestigious industry awards. \nCatering is approximately 1% of sales and remains a large untapped opportunity on which we have increased our focus. We recently expanded catering delivery availability to 1,500 restaurants from 940. And on average, we see about a 15% lift in catering sales when we add delivery. And we're decreasing group size minimums, and we're testing lower-per-person pricing options to expand our catering reach. \nOur delivery sales continue to grow at a rapid pace. And when our delivery partners offer free delivery of Chipotle to build their customer base, our customers respond in a big way as they did during Super Bowl weekend when delivery volumes increased nearly 250%. We'll continue to expand the number of delivery partners we work with, and we look to partner with them to offer compelling options to our customers. \nTurning to financial results. We generated revenue of $1.1 billion during the quarter, an increase of 7.4% from last year on comp sales growth of 2.2%. And that's on top of last year's 17% Q1 comp sales. Restaurant level margins for the quarter were 19.5% an improvement of 180 bps from last year, and earnings per share increased 33% to $2.13. \nThe Q1 comp of 2.2% is comprised of an underlying comp sales growth for the quarter of 2.7%, and that's before the 50-basis point impact from Chiptopia, as we lap deferred revenue from Chiptopia in Q1 of last year. Comp sales were driven by higher average check, primarily from the price increases taken since Q1 of last year. The price increase has averaged about 5% across the menu, and resistance has been less than 20%. The check average also benefited from customers adding queso to their order, which added about 200 bps. \nApril trends have been impacted by unseasonably cold and wintry weather in much of the country as well as the Easter shift. But taking these impacts into account, underlying April comp transaction trends are similar to Q1. Now keep in mind that we started lapping the first price increase from last year on April 15, which accounted for about 1% of the sales comp. Based on comp trends for the first quarter, we are reiterating our full year comp sales guidance in the low single digits with lower sales comps expected in the first half of the year due to tougher comparisons. Now this guidance does not include any projected impact from the sales growth strategies we're currently developing, as it is too early to determine the timing and magnitude of the impact these strategies may have on the comp. \nWe opened 35 new restaurants in the quarter and continue to expect 130 to 150 new openings for the full year. We're in the early stages of building our pipeline for 2019. And while it's too early to provide specific opening range for 2019, we expect to open at or above the 2018 opening level. We're pleased with the strong performance of our new restaurants this year and we'll continue to emphasize high-quality, high-returning new restaurants as we build out the pipeline. \nFood costs during the quarter were 32.4%. And that was down 140 basis points from the 33.8% last year. And that's down from 34.2% in Q4. The decrease from last year was driven by the menu price increase and efficiencies in paper and packaging. We expect relatively stable prices for the rest of 2018 across most items, resulting in food costs at or below the 33% range for the full year. Now our full year estimate is higher than the Q1 due to seasonal shift to source avocados from California, which will start in Q2. \nLabor cost for the quarter were 27.8%, 90 basis points higher than last year. Wage inflation of 5% was offset by the price increase but deleveraged from negative transactions along with the Chiptopia revenue deferral drove the higher labor as a percent of sales. We expect labor costs to improve in the low to mid 27% range in Q2, as we move into our seasonally higher sales months. And we expect labor for the full year to approach 28%, as crew and manager merit increases combined with general wage pressures continue to outpace the comp. Occupancy cost for the quarter was 7.4% or flat with last year, and we expect full year to be in a similar range. \nOther operating costs were 12.9% of sales, down from 14.1% last year. Our marketing and promo costs were only 1.8% in the quarter, which is a decrease of about 150 bps compared to last year. We still anticipate marketing and promo costs to be right around 3% of sales for the full year, with elevated spending for the remainder of the year. And while Chris and the marketing team are still working on a plan for Q2 and the rest of the year, we would expect marketing and promo will be in the 3.5% to 4% range in Q2. \nOther operating costs included about 30 bps of incremental maintenance and repair costs that we discussed on the last call, and we expect M&R to continue at this elevated level during 2018. G&A for the quarter was $77 million or 6.7% of sales, an increase from 6.5% last year. This was lower than expected due to stock comp forfeitures of around $4 million and the 2018 equity grant that was done very late in the quarter. With normalized stock comp in Q2, total G&A is expected to be around $7 million higher, around $84 million. And that run rate puts us on target to hit the $330 million G&A for the full year, which was communicated last quarter. \nUnderlying G&A in the quarter increased $8 million compared to last year to support our growth as well as several initiatives including new formalized training program and operational changes in the field. This increase comes after 3 years of flat G&A despite opening up 650 restaurants. As we fully develop our strategic plans to strengthen our unit economics and drive sustainable sales growth, we may need to adjust how and where we invest our G&A. As such, these G&A estimates for the second quarter and the full year is subject to change and we'll update you on any known changes during the special investor call Brian mentioned earlier. \nDepreciation was 4.1% of sales for the quarter, an increase from 3.7% last year. We expect depreciation to remain at about 4% for several quarters, as we accelerate depreciation for items expected to be replaced related to the maintenance and repair refresh as well as other capital initiatives that we described in the last call. Our pretax income was $94.2 million, and our effective tax rate for the quarter was 36.9%. I'd like to spend a few more minutes I normally would on this tax rate to put it in the right context. \nFirst of all, the actual tax rate we expect to pay the government is around 28%, not 36.9%. This tax rate of 36.9% includes about 810 bps, the bulk of which are noneconomic accounting items related to stock compensation issued in previous years. In essence, during the quarter, we wrote off deferred tax assets related to previously issued stock comp because the related performance shares either did not vest until they expired, or this year is vested at a much lower value. So the related deferred tax asset on our balance sheet needed to be written off or written down and the write-off flows through the tax expense line. \nWe expect no such write-off in Q2 and Q3, so our effective tax rate is expected to be around 28.8% in those quarters. During the fourth quarter, additional performance shares may expire. And if they do, we'll write off the related deferred tax assets for those awards. Again, we'll not actually pay a higher tax rate, but the write-off will flow through the tax line. We expect the tax rate including this write-off in Q4 will be around 38.4%. \nBefore I leave the discussion on taxes, I want to briefly walk through the components of our underlying tax rate. There are 5 key components to the underlying rate: First, our federal tax rate is statutory 21%. Second, our estate tax rate is about 5.6%, and it's higher than last year's rate because of the lower federal rate. That takes our rate to 26.6%. Third, we lost part of the deduction for free meals we give to our restaurant teams, which adds 1.3% to the rate, and it takes us to 27.9%. Fourth, about 1.6% is added related to the tax law change where all named executive officer compensation over $1 million is not deductible. And fifth, our rate is reduced by about 60 bps for employer wage credits and other miscellaneous items. And that gets us to the 28.8% I mentioned earlier. \nFor the full year, taking into account -- taking all this into account and adding about 4% on an annual basis for the noneconomic write-off of deferred tax items I talked about earlier, we estimate that the 2018 effective full year tax rate will be around 33%. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet and ended the quarter with $580 million in cash and investments, and we generated $200 million in cash from operations. \nDuring the first quarter, we repurchased $68 million of our stock at an average price of $311 per share, and we spent $58 million on capital investments, outlined on the previous call. We still expect opportunistically to purchase -- repurchase shares throughout the year, invest in the capital items we discussed on the last call and maintain a cash investment balance of about $500 million. \nAs I mentioned on the last earnings call, the overall guidance we provided then and we're reiterating today does not factor in any potential strategic changes arising from hiring a new CEO. As Brian mentioned earlier, we will need to realign the organization in order to support and execute our updated strategy. We also plan to carefully analyze underperforming assets during the second quarter. \nThis organizational review and the asset review will likely entail some onetime costs in 2018 that are too early to quantify. But these initiatives are intended to support and strengthen our economic model and set us up to execute our strategic plan and deliver long-term shareholder value. We'll share more details with you later this quarter. \nWe're encouraged by our first quarter results, and we're optimistic about the direction we're headed. We're confident that the changes we're making to our leadership and the realignment of our organization will enable us to be more nimble and more innovative in all areas: customer access, digital, menu and the restaurant environment, and it will allow us to execute better to deliver on our commitments to our guests, our employees and our shareholders. \nWe look forward to sharing more details about our plans at the special investor call, which will be scheduled sometime before our Q2 earnings call. Operator, we'll now open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Nicole Miller from Piper Jaffray.\nAnalysts: Jack, a quick one for you. Could you reiterate CapEx? You're going pretty quick through the numbers, I just wanted to check that. I wanted to check that real quick and then ask Brian a quick question.\nExecutives: Yes, Nicole, the CapEx right now we expect will be about the same as we outlined on the last call. It's going to be in the neighborhood of $300 million. About 1/3 of that is new stores. The other 2/3 is existing stores. The big items there is the refresh that we talked about, which is about $50 million. Another big piece was about $25 million for the digitized second make-line, and then there's another number of other things that we outlined in the last call, but those are still intact now. Nicole, just like I mentioned, our guidance hasn't taken into account the impact of strategy. It's possible that we may refine that or adjust that throughout the year and we'll give you a full recap on any changes when we talk to you before the next earnings call.\nAnalysts: And then, Brian, just a good -- a big-picture question for you, and thanks for your time. Do you see this as a recovery story or a global growth opportunity? Just curious how you see this playing out long term. And you talked about 5 pieces that you want to execute. Can you give us any little detail before the next call on maybe some of the low hanging fruit versus longer-term solutions?\nExecutives: Yes. Sure, Nicole. First, I think the opportunity is clearly a recovery story in the U.S. and we'll be focused on chasing what I believe is a powerful brand that has really strong economics, strong purpose that when we tie the elements that I outlined in my earlier comments and we'll go into much further detail on our special call, I think the opportunity is really exciting for what this brand has in front of it. The innovation will be across the business, as I mentioned, in access, digital, menu and frankly, we'll double down on our fundamentals. So I think the story of recovery, and then where that recovery takes us, I think, is also really exciting, but that's a much longer-term discussion.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Tarantino from Robert W. Baird & Company.\nAnalysts: Brian, just a couple of questions kind of high-level, how you're thinking about how this plays out over the next few years. Are you thinking, I guess, directionally that you're going to need to make a lot of investments in the business? I know you talked about realigning the structure, but do you think there's going to be a big step-up in expenses related to that? And then secondly, I know Jack mentioned next year you would open a similar number of units or maybe a little higher, but how are you thinking about unit growth as you execute this turnaround strategy? Do you think you need to slow or moderate the unit growth in the out-years to accomplish what you envisioned?\nExecutives: Okay. Thanks, David. Your first question, I think we can get into all the details of how we see the plan playing out forward. I think some of the good news is though, as I look into the business, like a great area of focus that people have been asking me about is our marketing spend. I think the marketing spend is one of those areas that we believe there's a lot of opportunity to take those dollars that we're currently allocating and make the brand much more visible with what we have. And then we're going to put in place more of a test-and-learn approach on the initiatives that we'll roll out. So we'll have clarity on what we believe the return is for the investment that we're making before we make those decisions to go beyond our current plans. So I think the recovery plan that we'll be putting in place or as I talked about earlier, our path to performance will be based on leveraging the idea of testing and proving out propositions while at the same token, with our organization, rebuild capability and restructure to support the strategy that I believe will set us up for growth in the near term and longer term. Your second question regarding units, the good news is the economics of the units that we're opening continue to look very strong. And as mentioned in the script, we see no reason for us to change the pace that we are experiencing this year. And obviously, as we to get further into our plan, we'll give the appropriate updates as the time permits when it's right to do that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore from AllianceBernstein.\nAnalysts: Congratulations, Brian, on the new role. I wanted to ask you if I may, one is about the quarter that just passed and then now sort of going forward. So in terms of the quarter that just passed, I guess I was surprised that what appears to be a fairly quick impact you might be having, a couple of things that you've seen or maybe new creative around marketing and then a waste management initiative that looks like it has some pretty big opportunities in terms of in-restaurant waste management. So I guess from my perspective, to what extent is this you, Brian, kind of putting your stamp already on that? And do you see a lot of low hanging fruit like what some of these initiatives seem to suggest just in terms of sort of basic systematic approaches? So that was question one. And then question two, if you could just talk a little bit about what you meant by consumer meaningful innovation across the business in the context of what's always been a very simple, straightforward menu and the operations that go with that.\nExecutives: Yes. Sure. So first, obviously, thank you for the kind words. Very excited to be in the CEO role of Chipotle. It's loaded with opportunity, which I think is what you're asking about. And what I'll tell you is in the short term, I think there are real opportunities for us to make simple pivots to increase, I think the appeal of our brand to those customers that are already very much big fans. One of the big surprises for me, frankly, even once it got announced that I was taking this role was the amount of people that reached out to saying how much love Chipotle and they love the food. And I think just with the most recent advertising, we made a little pivot towards reminding people what is great about the ingredients. This Food with Integrity purpose really resonates and reminding people why they feel good about eating Chipotle, I think, is always a good approach. So you'll continue to see us make simple pivots like that while we also continue to push this brand forward in a big way from the standpoint of access as it relates to digital innovation, menu as it relates to menu innovation that leverages our operating model, which I believe is something very special in this industry. And it allows us to do a lot of exciting things, whether it's dayparts or simple menu tweaks that I think will broaden the appeal. And then, obviously, I think you're kind of mentioning your question about waste management and such. Look, there's always opportunity to be better on the cost side, and we're going to continue to look for those opportunities along the way because that's just frees up the ability to give the customer more of what they want and our team members a better experience to provide the experience we want them to provide. So lots of opportunities I think in the short term. We're going to be very cognizant of what are the things we pace in sequence in the near term and what are the things we put into test to ensure we're focusing on the right things over the next 18 to 24 months.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia from William Blair.\nAnalysts: Jack, a quick question on the restaurant-level margin. I know you beat by a good amount in the first quarter. I think some of that, as you mentioned with marketing, will catch up as the year goes on. Are you still looking for 17.5 to 18.5 for the year? And then longer term, I guess with -- Brian, with your leadership, I mean how do you think about the long-term restaurant-level margin at Chipotle as you talk about new dayparts balancing the sales versus margin?\nExecutives: Yes, Sharon, on the margin range, we had a very nice quarter. It was aided by lower marketing. The good news is, Brian and Chris to the extent they came in and were able to look at what marketing was doing, they were able to redirect dollars so they weren't spent. And so that's kind of dry powder. So that's dry powder that we have for future quarters. I think that's a very good thing. I would say the range is 17.5 to 18.5, now appears quite conservative. I don't know that I would change it. I think what I'd do is we're going to probably hit for the year at the high end of that. Could we beat it slightly? Sure. I just wouldn't want to call it a victory just yet. But getting out of the gate this strong does show that we have some great margin potential. And then you wanted to know how the margin potential going forward. If you want general margin potential, Sharon, I can answer that. I still think that our margins are going to be highly contingent around volume. Like, for example, if we're in this 18.5% to 19% or so for this year, if we get up to $2.2 million volume, we can do a 22% margin. If we get to a $2.4 million volume, we can do a 24% margin. So really, the biggest lever to pull is bringing more customers in. And we bring more customers in, we know that our model levers up pretty significantly.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Glass from Morgan Stanley.\nAnalysts: Two questions. One is when you look at the brand and you've looked at it from afar, and now you're looking at it from the inside, how do you think about the price/value relationship in this business versus when you came from? Is there an opportunity, for example, to broaden the price/value relationships so you can capture more customers? Or are you happy with kind of the price/value? So think about just how you're thinking about that price/value equation for the brand going forward. And maybe just secondly, in your mind, what's the right time frame for us to look at your initiatives that you're contemplating and how they're going to play out? In other words, is this a year of investment and the impact is really felt in '19? Or do you think there can be some meaningful impact and changes inside of 2018?\nExecutives: Look, here's what I would tell you is the value proposition at Chipotle is tremendously strong. And now with that said, we will always be looking for innovation that continues to enhance that value proposition. The most important thing I think you can do for a healthy value proposition is you should never get complacent on where you stand. So we will be on the side of the consumer, making sure that we give them the value proposition that excites them to come back over and over again. So all these initiatives we'll be talking about, one of the ways that you make sure it's consumer relevant is it rings the bell for our customer on that value proposition, whether that value proposition takes place in mobile, digital, loyalty, menu, access, those are all important things. So that's the one piece. Your second question about time line, look, here's what I would tell you is as opportunities present themselves, we will walk through those opportunities to grow the business. As we find opportunities that yield even bigger benefits, through testing and learning and iterating, those things will probably take a little bit longer, but I think there are simple wins on our way to our path to what I think is going to be really accelerated opportunities in the future. So that's how I think about it. It's really a combination of both. We'll find some singles on our way to finding home runs.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Karen Holthouse from Goldman Sachs.\nAnalysts: So obviously, looking forward to the call that we're going to get in a month or 2 months with some more detail on this. But thinking about that call, is that something that's really going to be focused on where there are opportunities at the margin level or to drive sales? Or should we be also thinking about there's going to be discussion of any sort of more structural changes, whether that's the balance sheet is refranchising something that you're considering? How should we think about kind of what's on the table or topics for a discussion there?\nExecutives: Yes. What I would tell is we're going to use that special call the opportunity to give clarity even further into the strategy, the structure necessary to execute that strategy and what those key focus areas are to put Chipotle on the path to performance that we believe is highly attainable. So it will be comprehensive, and I think you'll find it will be choiceful. And I think there is power in simplicity, power in choice and power in a focused organization. So obviously, it will be a comprehensive discussion and the good news is we'll have our entire leadership team present to be able to really discuss our path forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays.\nAnalysts: Two things, one, just on the comp recovery, maybe from an outsider or actually most recently, a competitor's perspective, I'm just wondering, in your view, what do you think has been the greatest impediment to the Chipotle recovery over the past couple of years? Hence, I guess which of these initiatives you're talking about will be the most impactful, I guess, is a different way to look at it? And then the second question, which is on the fact that you came from Taco Bell, which obviously has left the laterals. But the one thing that's quite different is Taco Bell, being close to 100% franchise model, now you're 100% company-operated model. Just wondering, qualitatively, how does the approach differ, when you look at this just pros and cons to the franchising versus the company operated side? I'm just wondering, as you now come into your new role, how you have to think about things differently in that perspective.\nExecutives: Yes, sure. Look, I think to answer your first question, Chipotle, smartly, under Scott Boatwright's leadership, has refocused the fundamentals in running these restaurants. We've put clarity into roles. We've put focus on throughput, and we've also put high expectations on the guest experience and the food experience we're going to provide. Those fundamentals are critical whether you own the restaurants or whether you franchise them to people. So there really is no trade-off in what are the fundamentals to having a great restaurant? The only thing that I think Scott has done very well is he has put in a culture of accountability and a culture where people know they can count on each other to train, support and grow. And I think that is a foundational element for any upside that we will experience in this business. We can never lose sight on running great restaurants and having great people that lead those restaurants and supporting them with a wonderful culture and tremendous opportunities. So that's the first piece. The second piece is, I think the brand has been invisible. So I think if you combine great fundamentals in the restaurant with now a visible brand that has a powerful purpose and really craveable food, it's a recipe for a lot of opportunity that can play well in the way the customers want to eat food today and I believe how they want to eat food in the future. So I'm tremendously excited about the fundamentals that we are maniacally focused on, coupled with identifying how we make this brand much more visible and get a narrative back out there in explaining what makes our brand different, what makes our brand connect with people, feel good about the way they eat and live and why they still feel great about carrying the badge of Chipotle with them. And I think you had a question on franchising? We see no need to go down that path right now, given the economic model that we have and the returns that we get with building new restaurants so -- but thanks for the question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bittner from Oppenheimer & Co.\nAnalysts: I have 2 questions for you guys, both on just how you're thinking about the asset base. As you talk about an asset base review, first of all, is there an additional smell test you're doing on the unit economic threshold required to earn the right to stay in the asset base that you can talk to us about? And then, Brian, you talked about looking at your unit base and improving the accessibility of it. Could the implementation of drive-throughs play a role in the accessibility strategy, where it makes sense? Or is accessibility really just focused solely on digital? And I ask that question just in the spirit of where you came from, obviously seeing the benefits of drive-throughs.\nExecutives: Brian, I'll address the first question on the asset base. We haven't changed our threshold for what is the higher-returning asset. What we're looking at though is we had a number of restaurants that, before the drop in sales, were strong cash flows, strong returning stores. We opened a number of restaurants during a tough period where we got off to a slow start. So our asset review is going to look at all the restaurants that are clear underperformers, and these will be negative cash flow stores. So we're not looking at stores that are positive cash flow that the return is a little underperforming. We're going to look at stores that -- restaurants that are not cash flowing that maybe we picked the wrong site, maybe they got off to a wrong start and made a bad first impression and it's going to be difficult, if not impossible, to change that. And to give you an order of magnitude, the review while we're still in the middle of it, we're looking at something less than 100 restaurants. So it's not a huge list of restaurants but that's kind of the total population that we're looking at. We'll review each and every one of them, and we'll look at the whole story from a financial standpoint, from a real estate standpoint, from a what kind of first impression do we make. And then we'll make some very careful choices about what to do with the assets.\nExecutives: This is Brian. So your second question with regard to access, look, I think innovation in access, obviously, you are not surprised by the idea that, look, digital is a key piece of the puzzle, right, whether it's through the mobile access, delivery as access, also kiosk as access, catering as access. I mean I love the list that I'm rattling off here. The trick for us is figuring out what comes first and how we prioritize it accordingly. Now drive-throughs, I think, are an interesting proposition for Chipotle as an element. It will be something that will definitely part of our access innovation program. But that's -- in the scheme of what's going to happen in the very near-term versus what's more of a longer-term access innovation play, drive-through would fall further on that longer-term scale.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Matt McGinley from Evercore ISI.\nAnalysts: First question is on the -- for Jack, first is what you guided in February on the restaurant margin, it came in about 3 to 3.5 points better than expected. And we can see what is going to happen over the course of the year with COGS and labor expense, but a lot of that came from other operating expenses in this quarter. And I know that 150 bps was related to the ad spend shifts. So I'm curious what else in that line item would look better over the course of the year. Is that just not doing maintenance? Is there something else that is just looking better than you anticipated in that line item?\nExecutives: Well, thanks, Matt. The food costs behave really well. Avocados were something that took out a bite out of our margins last year. They got better late in the fourth quarter, and then they got better again. And you just talk about avocados, it's kind of almost every year. It has a big impact when it goes up and down. Nearly 50% of our transactions include guacamole. And so when prices shoot up, which by the way, they shot up from something below $30 a case to nearly $80 a case for part of the fourth quarter. So they've come back to kind of normal prices. If they stay at normal prices, we should have a decent food cost during the year. Labor is kind of the same story in terms of wage inflation continues. We expect it to continue and so the guidance I gave you, I think, is very reasonable guidance. So I think we got off to a great start. I think the comments that Brian made about Scott and the field -- our field team did a great job of managing food cost to the extent that it was their job to order the right amount of food and control food waste and things like that. They did a great job. They've done a great job managing labor as well. So I think we're off to a great start. I think if we keep these kind of controls, the next big surprise or additive thing would be additional sales. And so if some of the things that Brian mentioned go into test, and they test well and if we put those into more restaurant and we get more sales, we know we have the ability to leverage our margins when we bring more customers in, and that would be a nice thing to report.\nAnalysts: Got it. So Brian, I've heard a lot really from external people that when you look at the supply chain that Chipotle has versus other restaurant chains that just the way the food is prepped and the way that it is -- it flows through that supply chain, it always makes it harder to innovate Chipotle versus other chains. Having been to other restaurant chains, do you feel that there's a big factor that sort of limits your innovation at that company? Or do you see it as kind of green fields and there's a lot that you can do?\nExecutives: Yes, thanks for question. Look, I actually think the -- I'll break up your comment. I guess supply chain, meaning the ingredients that we use, I see no barrier to innovation. If anything, I'd see this great ingredients to be able to further distance ourselves from other restaurant alternatives. And then from a standpoint of then finishing that ingredient in the restaurant, it is a really powerful model. I mean if there's one thing that I'm really impressed by is the throughput capability of this line is something really special and unique. And I actually think it's an advantage to figure out how to do innovation that can build from a throughput machine. I don't think there are many places where you can say, well, I can have that great food done at that speed and then we can innovate on that foundation or that platform. And you'll see when we're talking about some of the innovations we're talking about, it just takes advantage of what I believe is a competitive advantage. So I think we're going to be able to innovate and distance ourselves and really put ourselves into what I believe is something very special that will delight customers and give our team members the ability to execute flawlessly.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andy Barish from Jefferies.\nAnalysts: Yes, I was wondering on that, actually, follow-up on a couple of those comments if there is some throughput data you're willing to share kind of currently versus a year ago. And then secondly, on innovation, not only supply chain, but just the physical plant and now the need for second make-lines. Is the space constraints make it more difficult to innovate? Or is that sort of an outmoded thought and there's ways to work around that with your fresh-eyes view on the business now?\nExecutives: Yes, thanks for the question, because the second make-line is actually a huge enabler for our business to take throughput to the next level, frankly. And the reason is we put digital capability into 250-plus restaurants, but the fact that we already have the second make-line physically there in all our restaurants is a huge opportunity for us to both innovate as well as drive throughput even further on our consumer-facing line as well as our second make-line. That second make-line has some efficiencies that we are delighted that we have in place because as we dial up the innovation in digital and we dial up that off-premise access, it presents a great opportunity for us to really enhance our throughput on both fronts.\nAnalysts: And then any throughput numbers you're willing to share or is it a little early for that?\nExecutives: Look, we can probably get into those details, Scott. It will be available as part of the special call we're going to do. And we're happy to take you through that then.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe from JPMorgan.\nAnalysts: Brian, talk about how you guys put in both fourth meal or the so-called late-night daypart as well as breakfast. And you've mentioned daypart a couple of different times and I was wondering what that could potentially mean at Chipotle whether it's different products at different times of the day, which can happen certainly within any quick service or fast casual type of format and whether it's possible to have breakfast without a drive-through or maybe you could put breakfast in just the dense urban stores while not necessarily putting them in suburban stores. Just thinking about what kind of potential you think dayparts really mean to the brand at this point.\nExecutives: Yes, sure. Look, I think one of the things that's really exciting about the daypart opportunity for Chipotle is today, we're opening at 10:30, 10:45, and we're closing roughly around 10:00 p.m. And there's opportunities to expand those hours and leverage our existing food and our existing platform in a very seamless fashion. Then you look at the obvious dayparts within those extended hours, and you quickly see where there's opportunity where we have some downtime where frankly I think with some marketing and some product innovation, we could turn those downtimes into transaction-driving times. So as I think about it right now, there is daypart expansion opportunity with our current model, and you layer on some menu innovation coupled with some marketing communication, I see a real ability to drive the existing platform in those dayparts without having to take the step today all the way through breakfast, introducing a whole new food platform. So that's where our thinking is today, not to say that in the future you may not even expand those hours further, and you need to think about new food platforms but that's not in the plan right now.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Palmer from RBC Capital Markets.\nAnalysts: Brian, first, a question on consumer scores, i.e., you mentioned something about becoming more consumer-centric. What is the consumer telling you about Chipotle today and the opportunities to improve perhaps in ways that you see in the brand deteriorated in those scores and just in ways that you just feel like it's underachieving. And that separately, just building on that last thing that you mentioned, the operating model. Everyone's always assumed that Chipotle's operating model because you have those limited number of wells in front of us, it doesn't have the ability to handle new menu news or even use price because of that simple menu, and those are 2 tools that you used with great effect in the past. And so I think people are having a hard time understanding how you're going to use those going forward. So those 2 -- that comment would be helpful as well.\nExecutives: Sure. So on your first question regarding the consumer, what we see is a real opportunity to make the brand more visible and be more top of mind with people to remind them why they love Chipotle. When you remind people about the fact that they buy into this idea of food integrity, cultivating a better world, they instantly feel better about the food they're eating. And we make good on that promise. So I think there's a real opportunity to be much more visible on why you want to be connected to this brand, why you believe in this brand. And based on the information I'm seeing, that resonates with how people want to eat today and how they will want to eat in the future. Look, there's also huge opportunities to get people access. One of our biggest complaints, frankly, is access to the brand. The brand is not that convenient. I know we have 2,400 stores, almost 2,500 stores. We, as a result, are not that convenient to people. So you've got people saying, hey, when can I do mobile ordering? When can I do delivery? When can I get Chipotle to me? And the good news is more than, I think, 50% people don't even realize that we started to do these things. So there is tremendous opportunity of educating people on why they should feel good about the brand, why they will love the food, why it's craveable, because it gives them all the customization, the abundance that they're looking for with the ingredients that they want. And then you combine that with now giving them more access and getting food to them on their terms. It's a really exciting proposition. Your second question on our ability to innovate, the line has flexibility so long as we first test and understand the demand that we're generating. If we prepare ourselves for what is going to happen, Scott and his operators will be capable to use our supply chain and our operating model to execute and meet consumers' expectations. Where you run into problems is when you get ahead of a forecast. And one of the things we're going to put in place here is when we are working on innovation, we're going to pilot that innovation so that we can have a prediction of what's going to happen and prepare the operating model accordingly to support it. So I'm very optimistic about opportunities that just leverage, getting more access to what Chipotle is today, and then you add some innovation, and I think you broaden the appeal. And we have predictability of what that's going to perform, Scott and the operators will be able to execute.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Gregory Francfort from Bank of America.\nAnalysts: I have 2 questions, the first for Brian. Have you looked at portion sizing and your thoughts on whether or not consumers are paying you for your portion sizes now, or if there's an opportunity to take that either up or down? And then I think you had also talked about employee turnover coming down recently. Any metrics around that? And what do you think is driving that? Have you made any changes on the training front? Or -- because the industry has been going up and so that would be kind of impressive, I guess I'm wondering what you guys are doing differently.\nExecutives: Sure. So the piece on employee turnover, I think that's a testament to Scott, putting clarity of what you're supposed to be doing in your role, how you support each other then in the restaurant and then providing clarity of how you can grow in this organization. And look, people like to stay in places where they believe they're appreciated and they have the opportunity to grow. And that's the culture that we're putting into the restaurant, and I think that's why you're seeing our turnover move down. And it's really exciting because the more we can push that turnover down, the more we don't find ourselves retraining the organization and we execute better. It's that simple. So Marissa, who's new to the team, she's going to be laser focused on how we drive this culture and training all the way through the restaurant while Scott partners with her to take from a culture of accountability to also a culture of growth. And I think if you've put those 2 things together, you will feel highly appreciated and believe that there's a future for them at Chipotle. What was your first question?\nAnalysts: The first question was just on portion sizing. And if you looked at whether -- yes.\nExecutives: Yes, yes. So look, one of the things clearly that people love about Chipotle is the customization proposition, and we're going to continue to figure out how we get more consistent in our execution for people so that they don't feel like they got too much this time or they got too little. So one of the things that I love about the experiences -- and the consumer knows is we're a place that wants to give them the experience that they're after with their food. And that's not going to change. So if people want a little more, we'll try to give them a little more. They want a little less, we'll give them a little less. But regardless, whether they're asking for a little more or a little less, one of the things Scott is focused on is how do you continue to get more consistent so people feel like they're getting the experience they got the last time as well as the experience they can count on for the next time. So that's where we're focused on, is how do we get more consistent with that experience. But we're never going to tell the consumer you can't ask us for a little more or a little less.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Charles from Cowen and Company.\nAnalysts: Longer-term question for Brian and a short-term one for Jack. So Brian, as you think about the road ahead, can you help us compare and contrast the starting points? When you look at Taco Bell in 2011 and Chipotle in 2017, what do you think of the different factors at play here that helped shape the turnaround, if you will? And then Jack, you mentioned as well, you see more comp trends that continued in April. How are you framing that? Just is that looking on a geometric 3-year, or how should we think about that perhaps just for simplicity? If you disclose the number, it might be helpful.\nExecutives: So why don't I go first and I'll hand it over to you, Jack. So here's what I believe for Chipotle. I believe the brand has been invisible. And I think as the brand becomes visible and we lead culture, that's going to be a huge opportunity going forward. This brand needs to be leading culture, not reacting to it. And the people that are loyal to this brand, that's what they want to be a part of. The other piece that is very exciting about this company is, look, there's limited innovation happening in small scale, and the opportunity for us is how do we take some of that innovation to pilot it and get it to a place where we can now do it at scale. And the opportunities, we talked about a few of them, right? They go from access to digital, to menu, even the restaurant design opportunities going forward. That is huge opportunity. A brand that has a lot of relevance, that's culturally right and leading, coupled with innovation, built on strong fundamentals that give people great food at a fast experience at a great value, I like the future. I really get excited about that because those are things that I think, as we put together this leadership team here with Chris and Scott and Marissa and Jack and Curt and Laurie, it is mission one to make this brand visible. And right next to it is be culturally relevant. So all the innovation and the fundamentals that we've put in place are going to, I think, attract people not only to work here but attract people to continue to be our loyal customers. And that's why I'm going to tell you about the long term.\nExecutives: And Andrew, in terms of what I looked at when I made the comments about April. We look at dollar trends. We looked at what our expectations were based on what we expect with the Easter shift, what normal seasonality would bring. The weather definitely hit us during parts of the month. I'm sure that's not a surprise to you. From a comp standpoint, we looked at it mainly from a 1-year comp standpoint. If you're going to do multiple years, you have to go back to 3. A 2-year trend will not give you anything meaningful. '16 and '17 lined up. '16 was a step down. '17 was a step up. So if you wanted to do a 3-year layer, you're probably get in the same ballpark. But for purposes of what we did, we just kept it very, very simple. Looked at April, compared to where our previous trends were. And underneath it all, it looks like the trends were very similar when you factor weather out.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Will Slabaugh from Stephens Inc.\nAnalysts: On the 5% pricing and then maybe more specifically on longer-term pricing plans, in general, I realize it's been a while since Chipotle have taken any meaningful pricing, but 5%, obviously, a decent ways ahead of where the rest of the industry is. So I'm curious, number one, if you plan to change the strategy to be more consistent in terms of low price increases; and number two, if you see any material difference in customer pushback to the pricing. In some of markets that we've talked about as being lower performing markets in recent years or if that 20% level that you talked about earlier has been fairly consistent?\nExecutives: Yes. Every 3-year pricing -- we've done it kind of 3 times in a row now, it's not necessarily strategy that we say, okay, no more price increases for the next 3 years. It just kind of happened. This past time, we didn't want to do it while we're trying to bring customers back into the restaurant. Before that, labor emplacement was very tame, and so we had strong comps and so we can lever our margin without resorting to pricing. It's a powerful advantage to have if you can continue to build your model, continue to expand leverage without constantly increasing menu prices, and so we took advantage of that luxury. Going forward, we're going to do what we need to do. And if that means doing smaller more regular price increases, we're certainly open to that. If we can lever our model, if we get the top line going and we lever the model without a price increase, we think we can drive greater value to the customer. Customers always love it when they get greater value. So we're not going to predetermine what and when we will do anything with pricing, but we're open to doing something other than kind of a 3-year cadence. And in terms of the resistance, we just don't see much resistance across the company. The only time we've seen it and we've seen it in the past as well, we see it a bit on the West Coast, and that's it. Otherwise, so there's the company, our customers, think we provide a great value. And value is not just based on price. It's based on high-quality ingredients. It's based on a lot of food. It's based on an environment that they enjoy. And it's actually the value that we bring is the harder thing to bring based on food, based on environment, based on the overall experience. Price is something that our consumers, sure would they like to play -- pay -- who wouldn't? But when they come to Chipotle and they get a great experience in a nice restaurant, the food is delicious, they call that a great value.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris O'Cull from Stifel.\nAnalysts: First, Jack, I apologize if I missed it, but what was the traffic decline in the quarter? And then secondly, Brian, several of the opportunities you mentioned to improve access for the brand seemed to make -- could take some time to build. But are there opportunities to quickly address the traffic declines you're seeing?\nExecutives: I'll answer around the traffic. The comp came from an increase in average check and you can take the 5% price increase. It's less than 20%, but just rounded up to 20%, that added for queso added too, so you can back into the transaction impact was. So it would be at the 3.3% or so range, 3.3%, 3.5%, something like that, so that's the underlying traffic.\nExecutives: And then to answer your question on what was my belief on the transaction opportunity going forward? Look, I think that's a real opportunity and one of the things that Chris and the marketing organization are going to be centered on. And the good news is I believe the combination of the brand visibility, the innovation that I talked about, I think there are opportunities in the near term that we can start putting into place, putting into action that make it a material impact on our transactions. And then over time, you'll see the culmination of all these things coming together, I think, play even bigger impact on the transactions and the number of people coming into our restaurants. So it's really a combination of the digital, the menu, the access, programs like loyalty. Those are all things that are going to be centered on making sure we are driving transactions as part of the proposition.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Strelzik from BMO Capital Markets.\nAnalysts: Over the last couple of years, there's been a shift in focus at different points in time, trying to bring back sales among existing customers at some points and finding new customers at some points. I'm just wondering, Brian, do you think about the opportunity set in that way, think of the customer base in that way? And if so, where do you see the greatest opportunities over the next 6, 12, 24 months?\nExecutives: Yes, look, here's what we know about our customers. Every age cohort loves Chipotle, okay? And we overindex with young people. And this brand is a youthful spirit. It's a challenger, right? It's breaking convention of what accessible food done fast is. And that appeals broadly. So our goal is not to be exclusive. Our goal is to be inclusive, and our goal is to drive transactions with a youthful spirit, a meaningful positioning and continue to leverage the strength of being a youthful brand that connects with youth. So that's how I look at it. Obviously, Chris and I are digging deep into it because we need to understand the reasons why you either slow down or increase your usage with us. And then we want to make sure we understand why all these different age cohorts are excited about being in the Chipotle business. Our goal is every category buyer could come in Chipotle. That's simple. We probably won't get all of them in the near term, but I'm going to try in the long term.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brett Levy from Deutsche Bank.\nAnalysts: If you could share a little bit, Jack, this question is for you on the margins. You mentioned that you think you can get to the high end of the 17.5, 18.5 range, and then you said you could possibly exceed it. But you also mentioned earlier that nothing is really being built into the plan with respect to what Brian's integration and those ideas can have. Can you just balance between what you were saying because it sounded like you said it's going to be without any implementation of Brian's strategies, but it also sounded like you were talking about assuming additional sales?\nExecutives: Yes, I think you heard it right. We reiterated our guidance, that comps would be in the low single digits. So the margin comments deal with that assumption, to the extent we have strategies that go through pilot and are worthy of a rollout, meaning we expect to get a return on our investment. That's not included in the comp. It's just too early to know what those things might be or what the magnitude might be so this is kind of a base case, if you will.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session, and I would like to turn the call back over to Coralie for closing remarks.\nExecutives: Thank you for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our special call in late Q2. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."

         "Operator: Greetings, and welcome to Chipotle Mexican Grill, Incorporated Special Investor Call. [Operator Instructions] \nToday's presentation contains 2 videos. Audio during this videos will only be heard over the webcast and not over the telephone. Those listening via the phone will only experience silence during this time. [Operator Instructions] \nAs a reminder, this conference is being recorded. \nI would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Coralie Witter from Chipotle.\nExecutives: Hello, everyone, and welcome to our call today. Before we begin our presentation, I will remind everyone that part of our discussion today will include forward-looking statements as defined in the securities laws. These forward-looking statements will include statements regarding our strategy and initiatives to build sales and the expected sales opportunity represented by digital channels, statements about our unit economics, information relating to the anticipated restaurant closures, information relating to anticipated onetime costs and restructuring charges and statements regarding our future sales potential as well as other statements of our expectations and plans. These statements are based on information available to us today, and we are not assuming any obligation to update them. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. We refer you to the risk factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K as updated in our subsequent Form 10-Qs for a discussion of these risks. \nI'd also like to remind everyone that we will not be providing any updates to our Q2 results to date or to our guidance. We have adopted a self-imposed quiet period that is in place following this call, restricting communications with investors until our Q2 earnings release scheduled for July 26. We will start today's call with some prepared remarks from Brian Niccol, Chief Executive Officer; Marissa Andrada, Chief HR Officer; Chris Brandt, Chief Marketing Officer; and Jack Hartung, Chief Financial Officer. We will allow plenty of time at the end of those remarks for questions. In the room and also available during the Q&A period are Scott Boatwright, Chief Restaurant Officer; Curt Garner, Chief Digital and Information Officer; and Laurie Schalow, Chief Communications Officer. \nBefore I turn the call over to Brian, I want to mention that the slides that will be shown during the webcast are also available on our website at chipotle.com in the Investor Relations section. And as a usability note, if you are accessing the webcast via a Chrome browser, you will need to hit the Play button when the slides appear on the webcast as the videos will not autoload. \nWith that, I'll turn it over to Brian.\nExecutives: Thanks, Coralie, and thanks to all of you joining us this afternoon and for your interest in Chipotle. As Coralie mentioned, we will not be talking about Q2 results today. Instead, we'll focus on our near-term and long-term strategy. But I will tell you that we are pleased with the underlying sales trends we are seeing as the sales trends from Q1 have continued into Q2. We're confident that the strategy we'll talk about today can accelerate our future growth. Our vision at Chipotle is to win today and cultivate a better future, and we will achieve that vision with a clear strategy, strong supporting structure and a new culture. \nSpecifically, today, we will talk about 5 focus areas that will drive sales and transactions as part of our growth turnaround: number one, becoming a more culturally relevant, engaging brand that builds love and loyalty; number two, digitizing and modernizing our restaurant experience that creates a more convenient and enjoyable guest experience; number three, running great restaurants with great hospitality and throughput; number four, being disciplined and focused to enhance our powerful economic model; and number five, building a great culture that can innovate and execute across digital, access, menu and the restaurant experience.\nBefore we dive deeper into those 5 focus areas, let me first share with you what I've learned about Chipotle since joining 3 months ago, a state of the union, if you will. \nFirst, I found a number of positives. As I mentioned in April, I've seen that consumers really love our brand. We can build on that and continue to create more distance between us and others. We don't believe anyone else has the quality of ingredients that drives great taste like we have, and now our marketing will lean into that to increase awareness and remind customers why they fell in love with Chipotle. We also have an excellent value proposition that we can enhance across all dayparts. And our new restaurant economics today are very strong. We have built a solid foundation and made progress in digital that we expect to accelerate in the coming months. Our second make-line is a significant competitive advantage that enables throughput and efficiency that enhances our economic model going forward. And finally, I'm very proud of the passionate people we have working in or supporting our roughly 2,500 restaurants that are responding enthusiastically to our new strategy. \nHowever, I also found that we have some gaps that we are actively addressing. There's a lack of discipline around priorities, process and accountability, and we are not sufficiently results focused, which made us reactive and hampered execution. I found skills gaps in many areas and insufficient data for decision making that have held us back from reaching our potential. There's no validated menu innovation pipeline, a general lack of customer understanding and no real process for scaling and commercializing innovation. And as you've heard me say before, the brand had been silent and lost some of its cultural relevance. I found that our marketing dollars have been inefficiently allocated, and we are working quickly to correct that. And lastly, in our restaurants, our throughput remains below potential, and we need to move consumers through the line of more quickly and deploy technology to help us do that. \nI'm happy to report that all of this is changing. Organizationally, we are adding experienced, professional talent in many areas, including marketing, menu, digital, analytics and Human Resources. Our leaders will provide clear direction, and roles will have defined accountabilities. We will invest in areas core to our strategy and be scrappy in looking for efficiency opportunities to fund our investments. For example, we have flattened the organization with the removal of layers, which, when combined with clear roles and responsibilities, will speed up decision making and drive better results. We are putting in place a clear governance structure for the organization to enable efficient execution. Importantly, we will build muscle around innovation by establishing a stage gate process where we test, learn and iterate, so that when we roll out a new initiative, we are highly confident in the probabilities of success. Overall, we will transform into a learning organization that is decisive and one that constantly iterates to achieve our core objectives. \nTo give you a concrete example of what I'm talking about, I'd like to tell you about our new digital pickup shelves, which you can see on your screen. While the app experience that was rolled out late last year is best-in-class, in many of our restaurants, it is unclear to our customers where to pick up that order, which detracts from the experience. In our downtown Denver restaurant, we cut a window into our wall near the kitchen door not far from the register and put a digital pickup sign above it. That simple change caused a double-digit increase in our digital sales within the first few weeks, and it's sustained. Not only did it provide a significantly faster and more convenient mobile order and pickup experience, but it served as in-store marketing that raised awareness among our customers standing in line. There's a big opportunity across all of our restaurants because over half of our customers aren't even aware that you can order ahead for pickup at Chipotle. We looked into adding windows in all restaurants but quickly realized that with permitting and other issues, it'd just take too long to roll out. So we hypothesized that we could get the same benefit with self-serve shelves and a sign overhead and get them rolled out much faster and more cost effective. We have digital pickup shelf prototypes in a handful of restaurants as we speak and expect to expand into another test market this summer. These shelves unlock the power of our second make-line and accelerate our digital sales flywheel to drive more mobile and delivery orders and more group orders, in addition to increasing peak capacity in our restaurants by providing a relief valve for our very busy customer-facing service line.\nThis is just one great example. What else is changing at Chipotle? We will make the brand more engaging, more visible and more culturally relevant. In our restaurants, we will provide a great experience with great hospitality, food cooked to perfection with convenience enhancing fast throughput. Importantly, we will lean into the strengths we have, namely our 70,000 employees that are passionate, committed and working hard to make Chipotle better; our great-tasting classically cooked food made from real ingredients, our strong value proposition, our brand equity and our efficient and effective digitized second make-line.\nWe have a lot of work to do to win today and cultivate a better future. While I could not be more excited about the future of Chipotle, it's important to be patient and recognize that people and process changes don't happen overnight. We need to add talent, build and create muscle memory around processes and testing capabilities and upgrade our enabling tools and technology. While we're doing that, we're focusing on the singles and doubles that can create short-term sales and transaction momentum while we build capabilities behind larger opportunities. \nLooking at our team, we are fortunate that Curt Garner started building improved digital capabilities when he joined [ 2 ] years ago, and we are now enjoying some of the fruits of those efforts with digital sales at just under 9% in the first quarter. We have the ability to lean more heavily into our digital initiatives to drive further growth, as I'll describe later.\nWe are also fortunate that Scott Boatwright began restructuring the field organization last fall and is completing the final stages of this process. Additionally, we're investing in training to constantly deliver an outstanding guest experience, investing in our facilities to improve the appearance of our restaurants and in modernizing the tools our restaurants need to enable faster throughput, better efficiency and a better team experience in our restaurants. \nI'll turn it over to Marissa, our new Chief Human Resource Officer.\nExecutives: Thanks, Brian. I am personally delighted to be part of Chipotle and to support our over 70,000 employees. It's great to be here today with you on the call. \nWe're excited about this unique opportunity to build a dynamic culture and lead Chipotle on its next and what we truly believe will be its most rewarding chapter. It's no secret that we're successful because of our people. We will deliver our strategy through a people and culture transformation. We will modernize the structure, build organizational capability, elevate our talent and leverage technology to provide our restaurants with world-class service levels from our support centers in Newport Beach and Columbus.\nWe are starting the creation of an organizational structure that we believe will allow us to best execute our strategy. As announced, this includes a reorganization where we will leverage technology to improve processes and align our work within our Newport Beach and Columbus support centers, with a structure that will provide world-class service levels to our restaurants. And we'll streamline our structure to eliminate 2 layers to stay nimble and agile as we grow, allowing us to reinvest in new capabilities and skills. It's our firm belief that the way to grow a company and to bring around the life is to grow its people. \nWe're building and bringing in new capabilities across the organization, including in marketing, menu, digital, analytics and Human Resources. Key aspects of our strategy are attracting, developing and inspiring best-in-class talent and cultivating an environment that inspires mutual learning and development. We will grow Chipotle by growing people. \nAs part of our cultural DNA, we will quantify our values to inspire curiosity, creativity and innovation. Our employee experience will be the foundation for our customer experience. As a team, we will be committed to driving accountability for performance in people at Chipotle as this is critical to cultivating a better world. \nToday, our employees join and love working at Chipotle because they love our real food. In the future, we will create an environment where our employees will join Chipotle because they love our real food and that they belong in a company that unleashes their potential. I can't wait to embark upon the journey together. \nNow I'll turn it back to Brian.\nExecutives: Thanks, Marissa. We are happy to have you on the team. I'll take a moment to elaborate on the priorities that will be visible to our guests: running restaurants, modernizing and digital our restaurants and becoming a more relevant and  engaging brand. \nI've already discussed the roadmap that Scott Boatwright is executing to run our great restaurants. When we talk about modernizing and digitizing our restaurant, it means making it easier to access Chipotle. We want our guests to enjoy Chipotle whatever way is most convenient for them, whether it be through ordering and paying digitally ahead of time, through delivery or via group ordering options. Our digital sales are fast approaching $0.5 billion with very little marketing support. We believe that by increasing awareness of our mobile order ahead feature and improving the in-store experience, we can accelerate the rate of digital sales growth. And our digitized second make-line has the capacity to handle significant increases in volume. Over time, we think this can be a multi billion dollar opportunity. \nI mentioned earlier the digital pickup shelves that we are testing can help unlock the potential of our digitized second make-line. For those of you that are new to Chipotle, our second make-line is a second production line in the back of our restaurant that looks and functions just like our front service line. We are now in the process of digitizing those second make-lines, as you can see on your screen. What that means is that instead of reading small font on paper receipts to assemble our orders, our crew now has 2 flat screens above the line with pictures that mirror the placement of the food on the line and [indiscernible] required to assemble an order. This results in much better throughput, greater capacity to build digital sales and, even more importantly for our customers, much better accuracy.\nDelivery is a significant opportunity for us that also leverages the production capacity of our second make-line. In April, we added door dashes and new partner. And we continue to expand a number of restaurants that all of our partners can deliver from. Our delivery business previously has been built with virtually no marketing. We learned this quarter through joint efforts with both the door dash and post mates that we can accelerate delivery growth simply through greater awareness and best-in-class delivery times. Later this summer, we will add delivery capabilities to our app so that the fastest way to deliver Chipotle to your chair is only a few clicks away.\nWe will also continue to increase access by making group locations more convenient for small and large groups alike. \nNow let's talk more about our great Chipotle brand. Being a relevant brand starts with insightful consumer understanding. We are investing in foundational customer research right now, and this will help us refine our innovation strategies around marketing, digital, access, menu and restaurants. We'll have conclusions from that research this fall, but some of the early qualitative findings are encouraging, namely that our commitment to Food with Integrity is a key point of difference, and our customers feel good about our delicious food. \nWe will build on the customer understanding that we are gaining with CRM capabilities, and we will test the loyalty program that leverages those insights in the second half of this year, leading to a planned national launch in 2019. Our loyalty program will give us a currency with which to incent and reward trial and new behaviors. \nWe are also increasing our brand relevance by adding new occasions, which our loyalty currency can support. The good news is that we have no value issue with our burritos, bowls and tacos. We can build on that strengthen and get people excited about snacking dayparts. For example, we are exploring a happy hour offering that enhances our value proposition during nonpeak snacking hours, with $2 tacos with a drink between 2:00 p.m. and 5:00 p.m. We're also exploring a similar offer for increased late-night sales after 8:00 p.m. \nAnother way to be more relevant to our consumers is with excitement around our menu. We think about menu innovation in 4 key ways: number one, what our customers tell us they want like nachos and quesadillas we're experimenting with in the test kitchen; number two, items our customers tell us they want us to bring back like Chiptopia; number three, new items that can be unique to Chipotle like the frozen Mexican chocolate milkshake and the avocado tostado that are also in the test kitchen; and finally, number four, celebrating existing items that are already in our restaurants. For example, many people don't know we have [indiscernible] or what [indiscernible] is. It's a great-tasting organic tofu cooked with our adobo blend for delicious vegetarian choice. The goal is to thoughtfully add delicious menu items that drive incrementality, are operationally easy to execute and enhance our ability to drive great throughput. We need to build capabilities in this area and build a pipeline utilizing a stage gate process. You'll begin to see more tests in the second half of this year, and you can expect relevant menu news in the coming quarters.\nFinally, we are changing the cultural narrative around our brand. We know we can drive growth by putting more effective and relevant marketing behind our innovative initiatives and by reminding people why they love Chipotle. Being culturally relevant means being present in sports, fashion, technology and entertainment. \nI'll turn it over to Chris Brandt, our new Chief Marketing Officer, to elaborate on how he is positioning to Chipotle to be more engaging and more culturally relevant.\nExecutives: Thanks, Brian. Before I talk about some of the early progress we've made, I just want to say I'm thrilled to be a part of Chipotle. It's early days for me, but I've never seen a brand that has more purpose and more passionate than Chipotle. Cultivate a Better World isn't just a slogan on a wall. It lives in the hearts of our employees and their pride in serving people responsibly sourced, classically cooked, delicious food you feel good about eating. \nMany consumers feel that same passion as well. There is such a unique emotional component to this brand stemming from its authenticity and transparency about food that we need to reinforce and reignite. To that end, our ultimate marketing mission is to make Chipotle not just a food brand but a purpose-driven lifestyle brand. What do I mean by that? Chipotle will become a brand the people want to know about, want to be a part of and want to wear as a badge. I genuinely believe that Chipotle can transcend the food category, separate itself from everyone else and be a category of one  because there are now compromises with Chipotle. No one has such great-tasting food that you feel good about eating like we do.\nTo accomplish that mission of making Chipotle a lifestyle brand, we need to change our approach and evolve our marketing philosophy and our tactics. We need to strike a balance of traffic driving short-term wins and long-term growth that we call winning today and cultivating a better future. We need to celebrate our food and ingredients and expand our reach with consumers. We need to be culturally relevant and a part of the conversation. We need to show people we can have some fun because when a brand has a purpose, is visible and is doing fun things that are part of culture, people are more interested in it and want to be a part of it. That's how you become a lifestyle brand. \nWe've already taken some steps in that direction. Our latest advertising campaign was put together in my first couple of weeks and was a noticeable pivot from prior work. We celebrated the food, showed how [ cravable ] it is, and we also demonstrated a little bit of our personality and sense of humor. Let's watch.\n[Presentation]\nExecutives: The data we have from third-parties result in anecdotal evidence shows these as were very well received by consumers. Not only did we change our creative direction in a matter of weeks, we also changed the media plan to feature broader regions popular program. We advertise in signature, culturally relevant programs like the NBA playoffs and season finales of top shows across the variety of networks. We also linked to sponsorships with a top gaming team playing Fortnight, easily the hottest video game right now that is taking a nation by storm. These actions not only got us heightened awareness for the consumers, but our team members also saw them. One of my favorite quotes is from a team member who saw the ads on TV and said, \"I love them. It feels like we are back on the front foot again. That's awesome.\"  \nBut there is much, much more to come. We are shifting our marketing from a field-based, promotion-driven approach to a centralized strategy featuring broader reach with category users. Our goal is to make our marketing dollars more efficient and effective and, most importantly, help drive traffic. The foundational consumer research Brian mentioned will give us better insight in consumers. We're putting a stage gate process in place with dedicated resources to help validate new product and promotional ideas. We are working with our agency partners to develop innovative, creative that is focused on celebrating Food with Integrity and the real ingredients that make Chipotle great. We're rolling out a new tagline this fall that's a perfect fit for the brand. We're developing innovative media plans with key partners to reach consumers and unique ways across both traditional and digital channels. We're going to expand the awareness of mobile ordering and delivery or, as we call it, the easiest way to Chipotle. We're going to be more engaging in social media. Already, 2 of our recent Instagram posts are the most liked in Chipotle history. Overall, we're going to be a much more agile, innovative and visible brand that people will talk about. \nAgain, I'm thrilled to be part of Chipotle. We've made a ton of progress in the last few months, but the best is yet to come. Brian, back over to you.\nExecutives: Thanks, Chris. We expect that all of these initiatives across marketing, digital, consumer access, menu, analytics and operations combined will create a flywheel that can drive transactions to accelerate our growth. \nTo put it another way, we will amplify our unique positioning, real ingredients, real cooking, real opportunity and now through our new strategy, real performance. \nI'll turn over to Jack now to discuss the short-term financial implications of the restructuring we are undertaking to execute on and align behind the strategy that will unlock our brand's potential.\nExecutives: Thanks, Brian. Before I begin, I want to remind everyone that we're not providing a financial update on our current quarter, and we're not updating or reaffirming the guidance provided on our last earnings call. \nEverything you've heard today about our focus on running great restaurants, modernizing and digitizing our restaurants and becoming a more relevant and engaging brand is designed to drive transactions, improve our unit economics, accelerate our earnings growth and create significant shareholder value. While it's too early to predict the timing and process impact each of these strategies will have on results, I'm confident that the strategies will lead to higher average unit volumes and higher margins in the future. All of these opportunities are going through a new stage gate process designed to ensure a successful rollout. As we move through those stage gates over the coming year, we'll have a better understanding around the timing of when these new initiatives will translate to sales growth. In the meantime, we know that our combination of great operations, clever marketing and pushing further into our digital initiatives will drive near-term sales growth.\nExecuting these strategies at a high level will require changes to our organization and to our culture, and that will result in nonrecurring charges during the second quarter and over the next few quarters. We'll clearly call out these nonrecurring charges as they're incurred each quarter so that you'll have a clear perspective of the underlying progress we're making in our business results. These nonrecurring costs primarily relate to the moving of our offices, the restructuring of our organization some and the closing of underperforming restaurants. In aggregate, we expect these costs to be in the range of $115 million to $135 million. Of that amount, we expect about $50 million to $60 million will hit the second quarter. And while most of the remaining charges will hit in 2018, there will likely be some charges, particularly related to determinating restaurant and office leases that will spill into 2019. As a result of our review of underperforming restaurants, we expect to close between 55 and 65 restaurants, including the 5 restaurants located outside of Denver. The second quarter charge will include about $30 million related to restaurant asset write-offs, while the lease buyout costs of these restaurants will be charged over the next several quarters. About half of the restaurants will close within the next 30 days, and the remainder will close over the next several quarters as we negotiate lease buyouts for the landlords. The nonrecurring costs will primarily be reflected in 3 line items: G&A, the loss on disposal and impairment of assets and depreciation, and we'll clearly call these out -- these charges out each quarter.\nIn addition to the $115 million to $135 million estimated charges, we'll also write-off about $10 million in deferred tax assets over the next few quarters as fully vested but underwater stock options will expire as we complete the restructure of the organization. This deferred write-off will hit our tax rate and is in addition to the tax rate it back we discussed on our Q1 call. \nWe'll provide more color on the quarterly timing of all future nonrecurring costs when we have more certainty around that timing. In future earnings calls and releases, our quarterly disclosures will clearly break out onetime costs from normal recurring costs so you can file out the underlying trends. \nWe're confident that the following these strategies would lead to better customer experience, stronger customer loyalty, better unit economics and the creation of significant shareholder value.\nI'll now turn the call back over to Brian.\nExecutives: Thanks, Jack. When I first spoke to you on our Q1 call, I shared how excited I was about the opportunity to lead Chipotle in its next chapter of growth and to build on a strong foundation of a well-loved brand that has a ton of growth optionality and one of the best economic models in the industry. As Jack mentioned, driving transaction growth is the single biggest clever enhancing our economic model. But we will also be scrappy and find efficiencies to add a tailwind to our economic model. \nThe combination of top line growth and margin expansion will ultimately lead to increased store growth, and I could not be more excited about the future of Chipotle. \nCapitalizing on that opportunity requires us to build a new culture of creativity, action and accountability. The realignment of the organization we are undertaking this year is a significant effort. And while it is potentially disruptive in the short term, it is good for our customers and our shareholders and will result in a much stronger organization that is structured to innovate and execute successfully to win today and cultivate a better future and to capitalize on the wealth of opportunities for many years to come. I can easily see a future where Chipotle more than doubles revenue to over $10 billion. \nSo as I've outlined today, our 5 focus areas that will drive sales and transactions as part of our growth turnaround: number one, becoming a more culturally relevant and engaging brand that builds love and loyalty; number two, digitizing and modernizing our restaurant experience that creates a more convenient and enjoyable guest experience; number three, running great restaurants with great hospitality and throughput; number four, being disciplined and focused to enhance our powerful economic model; and number five, building a great culture that can innovate and execute across digital, access, menu and the restaurant experience.\nOkay. Before we open up the call to questions, I'd like to show you a quick video clip of the Chipotle of the future.\n[Presentation]\nExecutives: We have our executive leadership team here with us today available to answer your questions. As a reminder, we will discuss our second quarter results on our July 26 earnings call. And we'll now open up the line for questions regarding our strategic outlook. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] \nOur first question comes from the line of Nicole Miller from Piper Jaffray.\nAnalysts: I appreciate the update. I find it very fascinating how you talk about the brand previously being somewhat silent, and I want to understand if you've measured perhaps aided versus unaided awareness or some other measure. And how will you be measuring the relevancy going forward beside the obvious same-store sales performance?\nExecutives: Sure. So this is Brian. So what we've been tracking is we have a brand tracker that tracks both top-of-mind awareness while as kind of what people are saying about the brand. And what we have seen, now it's a fairly new study that started back in February, so we don't have that much historical data on it, is an opportunity to improve from where we are today. We also -- as I mentioned in the call, we've just placed a foundational study, which will give us some key metrics on the brand that we'll be tracking going forward. And we're going to use the combination, obviously, of sales performance, top-of-mind awareness and then some key brand metrics that we'll be defining once we finalize all of this foundational research that's coming back.\nAnalysts: And then you also mentioned you're not at peak transactions. And I think I was measuring it earlier today around just over 400 on about 1.9 million AUV in the $12 to $13 average check. And I think, historically, there were stores that, at peak, could do that maybe in an hour. So just a quick 2-part question. Do you get more transactions by extending hours? Or do you get more transactions at peak? And I was just curious to know, how does the system do at peak? What are the number of transactions currently?\nExecutives: Yes. I'll answer this, and I can have Scott chiming as well. But we believe there's more opportunity for transactions at peak. So moving people through the line faster, and that goes back to what Scott really has implemented around things people are clear on the roles and their accountabilities and being position so ready for the through that are capable of doing. So that's what we're focused on. Scott, do you want to add anything?\nExecutives: Thanks, Brian. Nicole, I think it's something that we have really only begun to put a shoulder against over the last couple of months and we feel have more work to do to really move our restaurants at the pace with which we moved prior. And so there's a lot of work going on from a training perspective to ensure we're focused on the right things as it relates to shift management overall at Chipotle, something we've got to do a better job of teaching, which is a key component of is faster throughput. So more on that to come, but it is a high priority for us and something we're working against as we speak.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Tarantino from Baird.\nAnalysts: Brian, my question is about your growth outlook for the next few years. And one thing you didn't mention is how you're thinking about unit growth over that horizon. And I guess, as you think about the opportunity to improve the economic model, what do you need to see to either accelerate the growth or continue the type of growth that you've outlined for this year? And then I have a follow-up question about the restaurant economic model. I think you mentioned that there are opportunities to drive some efficiencies to provide a tailwind to that model. So can you just elaborate on what you meant by that statement as well?\nExecutives: Sure. So your first question regarding new units and the pace of development. First of all, the new unit economics we're getting right now are, I think, best-in-class. They're still returning north of 30%. So we're very optimistic about the new stores that we're opening. I will tell you, we'll -- the pace will increase as the business continues to recover the top line sales. And I think that is something that we're going to be smart about on how we ratchet that up going forward because the good news is the returns are there. And I think as the core business really gets itself back to a place of where it was performing, we can also then, at the same time, start enhancing the new unit development. So that's going to be the approach we're going to take, David. On your second question around efficiencies and the economic model or adding additional tailwind, this is really to the point of our culture where we're going to get a little scrappier and how we approach things. And obviously, the number one way for us to see that margin expand is through the top line sales growth, but I think there's also some opportunities for us to get scrappy as we look at business on how we're spending our money and the areas where it's being spent on. So those are really the components that we are going to be looking at to make sure that we really maximize the economic model of the business.\nAnalysts: And then just a quick follow-up. Maybe it's for you or for Jack. Any way to size up the opportunity on the costs side, either at the unit level and then you also, I think, mentioned that you're cutting out a few layers in the G&A structure. Should we think about those as opportunities that flow through to the bottom line? Or is that sort of an area where you cut and then reinvest somewhere else? So at least any thoughts on that at this stage.\nExecutives: Yes, David, this is Jack. On the G&A, the savings are going to be reinvested. We'll have a leaner, more nimble organization. Brian talked about, we got skills gaps. We've already been filling a lot of those skills gap. So I would say it's going to be reinvestment. G&A, we think about that as being similar. Once we get through some of these onetime charges or similar to the percent of sales is what we had in the past, I would say that excluding stock comp, so it's going to be reinvestment. The reinvestment is going to really be reinvested in things that will drive our growth. In terms of economic model and what we can do for, it's really too early to tell, I think it's more of a culture and an attitude. We're going to focus on fewer things, and the fewer things will either drive growth or they will enhance the economic model. And I think by focusing on these fewer things, we're can expect we're going to get results. But as we identify the opportunity, David, in the coming quarters, we'll share more with you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore from Bernstein.\nAnalysts: I have one follow-up to an earlier question and then a question on technology. The follow-up was the goal of both improving throughput and menu innovation and maybe adding items. And I think, historically, there was some sense internally that maybe those were inconsistent. So just is the answer technology? Is it what you're talking about in terms of really defining people's roles and where they should be? Or I guess, how do we reconcile what has always been known as a very simple model where it felt like every time something was added, for example, case or something else has to come up with what we're hearing in terms of menu innovation? And then I have another question.\nExecutives: Sure. So obviously, one of the key criteria for us as we go through the stage gate process with any new menu item is going to be the impact on throughput, whether it improves throughput because we've added new capability with equipment or some technology advancement, meaning it moves to the second make-line, something on those lines. But one of the key criteria for anything to get to the national phase is going to be a throughput element. And what we've seen is there is some menu items that we believe have a high probability of having no impact on throughput. There are other menu items that are going to come with requirement, probably some equipment investment and real understanding of how do we tweak the process if we wanted to maintain the same level throughput that we have today. So obviously, the second one that I just talked about is going to take a little bit longer from a testing and validation standpoint than a menu item that has no impact on throughput or the process or equipment. So that's where the safe gate process becomes a  very important piece of the puzzle so that we really understand the impact on operations, the consumer and the team member and then obviously the financials. So we'll be leaning into that stage gate process to ensure we find the power of throughput and innovation.\nAnalysts: Understood. And then just on the technology piece. I thought I heard you say you're going to add delivery capabilities to your app, and I think that's something that no one else yet has done in terms of the companies partnering with third-party. It has been companies with in-house delivery that have been able to do that. So maybe talk about how you've leapfrogged some of what we've seen elsewhere and whether you think that is going to be a meaningful distinction between what we're seeing with other restaurants that are partnering with third-party aggregators.\nExecutives: Yes. So I'll hand it over to Curt, but let me answer your couple of questions there. Obviously, one of the things we're really excited about with delivery is our model results in food that is delivered with great speed. And one of the things that we're really excited about in our door dash partnership is we saw that the first-hand relative to all your other food alternatives on the door dash website. So we're very excited about the idea of being able to once you're in our app, stay in the app and get people to access opportunity to have Chipotle delivered to their home because I think people are going to be excited about the speed at which they can get Chipotle delivered to them. I don't know if we're the only ones with delivery in our app, but I'll hand over to Curt to see if he [indiscernible].\nExecutives: Yes, I'll just follow up by saying they are really excited, Sara, about this launch and the tests come later in the year. And as Brian said, we're a learning organization now. So it's early days, and we're excited to see how customers respond and how we can continue to make digital the easiest way to Chipotle.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Glass with Morgan Stanley.\nAnalysts: My first question is simply a timeline question. Brian, when should we expect to start to see the results some of these initiatives coming into play, specifically in the back half of this year? Is that an unreasonable expectation? Do you expect, for example, a product launch in the third quarter? And is there something on the marketing front? You talked a lot about pieces and a lot of need to rebuild some capabilities. So what's a reasonable expectation for the type -- 2 or 3 examples of things that should happen inside this year, let's say?\nExecutives: Yes. So what I can definitely share with you is you're going to start to see us testing programs in the back half of this year. So you'll see these tests happening in -- with some food ideas. You'll see some tests happening with digital, loyalty. And we're very excited about all those. Now depending on how things perform in that stage gate process, we'll dictate the time table for which we roll it out because one of the things that is important for the organization is we iterate, we listen, we learn before we then decide to go with a national launch. So we're in the early days of validating these propositions. And once we start moving through the stage gate process, we'll be sharing when they will actually be hitting the national programs going forward.\nAnalysts: Okay. So I guess, go slow to go fast, in other words, to make sure that you're getting them right when you launch them?\nExecutives: That's correct.\nAnalysts: Okay. And then remodels we discussed last call or maybe 2 calls ago was something that's a '19 effort maybe before you arrived. Do you look at the businesses needing a substantial remodel or light remodel? Or how do you view the physical assets? And how do you phase that into these other initiatives?\nExecutives: Yes. So we have an initiative called the Big [indiscernible], and that is happening. I'm happy to say we're on track to be finished by the end of this year. I think we're exactly 50% down right now. And this is really where we are bringing our -- all of our restaurants up to date.  It's fixing the lights, the painting. It brings them back to, I would say, a Class 1 restaurant experience. Separate from that, we also have an effort going on with the redesign, which is kind of the Chipotle restaurant of the future. And that is going to be coming -- you'll see that coming into testing in the back half of this year, probably right around the fall timeframe. You'll see us going into New York City.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia with William Blair.\nAnalysts: It's Sharon Zackfia, but that was a good try. I guess, a couple of questions. Now that digital is up to around [ 9% ] of sales, I'm just wondering if you've been able to harness that data at all and kind of incent consumer behavior in different ways. I don't know where you are on that fit. And then if you could give us some perspective, once you launch loyalty, kind of when you'll be able to use that data to then kind of create new customer behavior? And then lastly, I don't think you mentioned international at all. So if there's any thought on what to do with the international locations.\nExecutives: Sure. So your first question around digital and loyalty and, I guess, more importantly, the data approach to remarketing or incentivizing our customers. That's absolutely part of our approach going forward. One of the things I'm really excited about as we get this pilot going with our loyalty program, we're going to start to move to really the tailored data-specific marketing that you can use currency in the rewards program to drive certain behaviors, incent certain products, incent certain experiences. And yes, we think that's going to be a key unlock for the business going forward because as this business goes from 10% plus in digital sales, that presents an opportunity for us to have more customers in our business, engaging in different level than they have in the past. And then when you layer on top of that a loyalty program with a strong CRM engine, I think really exciting things will be unlocked as we roll out loyalty on a national basis into 2019. Your second question was on international. For now, international is something that we are managing. It's not an aggressive part of our plan for growth. We're focusing the aggressive growth in the U.S. business, and that's what we outlined right now.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Karen Holthouse from Goldman Sachs.\nAnalysts: Two questions that go back to some of the prepared remarks. There is a comment on opportunities to enhance the value proposition across dayparts. And then I think as it relates to value, the only specific thing mentioned was a happy hour test. Are there other things you're looking at in terms of your pricing or sizing in other daypart versus more real of a comment on the overall customer experience potentially layering in loyalty? And then second is it would seem like some of this sort of foundational consumer research is really going to feed back into some of these tests and other strategy. How long is it until you think you get sort of the base level of data in place for that?\nExecutives: Sure. So your first question on the value and how we see that playing out. You're exactly right. We see using our rewards program as a great way to present targeted value incentives for customers when they want it, where they want it and how they want it. Combine that with providing some value that matches with a daypart like the happy hour, which matches more like a snacking occasion, I think then we have to provide the right value equation for a snacking occasion between the hours of 3:00 to 5:00 p.m. So those are our lead-in ideas. And then obviously, a key piece of the puzzle is always understanding our price equation as well. And what will be important is we'll continue to make sure we understand how consumers are interacting with the menu and where we see opportunities to enhance our value proposition. We will do it in a smart fashion. Your second question on the timing of the consumer foundational research. Absolutely, this will inform pretty much the entire business. And we're really excited. We're going to start getting some of the preliminary results back here in the next month, and then we'll have the entire package back by the time we do the fall. So we're already starting to get some learnings back. And it's very exciting because it's new knowledge for the company, and it's new insight into our customers, which I think is going to be hugely valuable for us going forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe from JPMorgan.\nAnalysts: A couple of follow-ups. Firstly, when you make delivery available on your app, what percentage of stores will  that currently cover?\nExecutives: So you're talking about the in-app delivery experience? [indiscernible] 10%.\nAnalysts: Yes, exactly.\nExecutives: John, to start, we will be covering approximately 1,500 restaurants and expect to get to around 2,000 restaurants by the end of the year.\nAnalysts: Okay, perfect. That's a big number. Secondly, Jack, I think the question for you, I mean, you mentioned G&A being similar as a percentage of sales into the [ path ], excluding executive comp. The path has actually shown some variability in terms of G&A, and obviously, executive stock comp -- executive comp is actually a big percentage of that. So as we think about '19 and '20, post the move, some of the restructuring and some of the hires, I mean, can you help us just get closer to a number in terms of what G&A should be as a percentage of sales for a company of this size? [indiscernible], including stock comp?\nExecutives: Well, including the stock comp, it's tough only because when the stock moves, stock comp moves pretty dramatically as well. So the thing we can control is the underlying G&A that we spend on people, offices, things like that. I think as we get through a lot of these nonrecurring charges, our current underlying G&A is in the, call it, low 5% to mid-5% range. When you add in stock comp, you're in the mid- to high 6s or something like that. I think that as we get through, all of these adjustments with our offices and our structure will still be in that same kind of range. Now once we get to that range, as we build sales with the strategy that you've heard today, we've been able to lever G&A in the past, and I expect we'll be able to leverage G&A in the future. I think the important thing is our G&A will be in a similar pattern. What's really going to drive is we're going to drive top line sales that will drive our margins, that will drive economics. And that's where I think most of our shareholder value is going to come from.\nAnalysts: And then 2 quick ones. Brian, to your previous experience and especially on the operating side, how do you think about the right cost, food and paper plus labor for Chipotle? I mean, that's changed quite a lot over the course of the history of this company, but do you think about it at the 60% range? Do you think about it at 55%, somewhere in between I mean is there is something that you think about on the prime cost side in terms of what this business should be over the course of the cycle?\nExecutives: Yes, John, this is Jack. Right now, we're in kind of the 60% range. Our model works quite well in the 60% range, but you know very well that when that long ago, we were in the 55% range, and that's how you get margins in the mid- to high 20% range. We have the ability to get back to that, but it all depends on the top line. And so the strategies that you've heard today are very heavily weighted towards the driving the top line, bringing customers in, making the brand relevant again. If we get all that well, we have the ability to get those back into some of our historical ranges.\nAnalysts: And that's a very important point. And then finally, when you mentioned $10 billion of your sales for the Chipotle U.S. brand, how many stores does that contemplate in your current thinking in terms of optimizing that portfolio?\nExecutives: Yes. Look, the way we think about it is you could be easily around 5,000 stores at some point while we're [ exceeding ] $10 billion.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays.\nAnalysts: Two questions. First, just Brian, I know you [indiscernible] pleased with the underlying sales trends. Just wondering from our side of the seat, and that compares obviously difficult to read, the 1 to 2-year, what measures do you focus on perhaps daily or weekly or monthly, whether it's variability by geography or daypart or product line or how would you define success in your seat in terms of the comp growth? And then I had a follow-up on the supply chain.\nExecutives: Sure. So look, we are watching sales and transactions everyday, and we look at it by region and by daypart. And what we continue to see is good performance in all the dayparts. And we're optimistic that the continued improvement in throughput and operational execution will continue to support the sales trends that we've seen to date. And then obviously, going forward, the plan is to accelerate the sales and transactions with the initiatives that we put through the stage gate process that we have a high level of confidence that we'll grow business. So that's what we're looking at some of the scorecard will keep an eye on on the other basis. The other key thing we also look at it is obviously what percent of our business is growing through the [ 7, 8 ] because I guess it's an indicator of how we're doing on driving our digital and off-premise businesses.\nAnalysts: Got you. And just separately on the supply chain side of things. I mean, there was a mention of Food with Integrity and authenticity and transparency, which sounds like conference calls from years past. Just wondering, how much time have you spent focused on the supply chain? Maybe what changes do you think need to come? Obviously, there's big risk in the supply chain and as you enhance kind of new products and whatnot, I'm just wondering your thoughts on the supply chain that it's been put in place and what we should expect going forward.\nExecutives: Yes, sure. So a couple of things. One, I think I mentioned this in my prepared remarks. Maybe I didn't. But we've hired a new supply chain leader. And it's probably the first time in a long time that we've had, what I would call, a real expert in supply chain space leading our supply chain efforts. He's 2, maybe 3 weeks into the job now. Very excited about him getting into the role and helping us figure out our next chapter on how we work with our suppliers and partners on our supply chain. And then to answer our question, my ability to get [indiscernible], I've had the opportunity to meet with our to bigger partners, OSI and [indiscernible]. And the thing that I love about our partnerships is they're as equally excited about the food as we are. And to have that commitment to that quality is usually valuable. And then obviously, we'll figure out how we queue in the most sufficient fashion. But when you have that shared value of commitment to quality and excellence and Food with Integrity and really trying to move things to another level, it makes for a powerful partnership. So I'm very excited about Carlos joining the work, and I'm very excited about their conversations with some of our key suppliers.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Charles from Calvin and Cole.\nAnalysts: It's actually Brian on for Andrew. And I could just ask maybe 2 around digital. So in terms of the a pp, as we look out this kind of the adoption curve, what do you guys view as one of the biggest hurdles to break into the fray and sort of offering consumers compelling reason to download the app? The confidence is always -- is encouraging, but thus far, we've seen this as a challenge, not only for fast-casual, but sort of the broader restaurant industry. And then your answer to Sara, I believe, it sounded like maybe once customers download the app, delivery could drive sort of deeper engagement with the app. What are the bigger hurdles you see the breaking through the fray and driving that adoption in-house app? And then just secondly, from marketing perspective, in the spirit of moving away from promotions and more towards a centralized approach, from a delivery or mobile app perspective, does that mean marketing will center more so on media ads? Or could that have more of a promotional element?\nExecutives: Sure. So look, I think our biggest hurdle on the app, frankly, is just awareness. Right now, I think I was just looking at the numbers, but more than 50%, I think like 52% of people aren't even aware that we have an a pp. And I think this goes back to that question somebody asked me earlier, why we believe the brand isn't as visible as it should be. It's things like this that key growth engines for business that we spent really low awareness on. So job number one is to get people aware of the app as I think they're going to love the experience based on the users that are already in the app. And then job two is how do you get them to continue to use it. I think that continues to provide utility in that app, adding things like delivery, adding loyalty program. These are things that will continue to provide utility for them because then what we'll be able to do is get into this game of one-to-one communication and really changed the level of engagement with our customer through that app experience. So it's going to be a combination of things that, I think, ultimately, move the app forward. But I think the biggest challenge for us first and foremost is making people aware that they have the app then you don't need the experience, reason to keep using it, right? So it's the whole experience that is just superior to anything else they've seen where when they order, they pick it up, the order is accurate, the speed is like nothing they've seen. If it's getting delivered, it's at the level of speed that they haven't seen, with accuracy that they haven't seen and then obviously layer in the idea of loyalty. I think we started building the utility [indiscernible] usage over time. What was your second question?\nAnalysts: Great. Yes, just secondly, just from a marketing perspective, I know you guys have about sort of moving away from promotions and sort of more towards centralized marketing approach. But just from a delivery or mobile app adoption perspective, just wondering, does that mean the marketing, to get those sign-ups, will center more so on media ads? Or could that have a more of a promotional element of maybe a coupon or something to that effect?\nExecutives: What we're going to be moving towards is programs that, I think, are going to engage and connect at a different level than we have in the past. And how we choose to connect will be driven by the users that we're trying to persuade with the experience that we provide. So you're going to see us be very present in digital, mobile, all the nontraditional mediums. And you're also going to see us show up in the traditional mediums because, I think, at the end of the day, Chris, feel free to chime in here, we want to be relevant and engaged with all category users like medium and heavy. And to do that, that means our marketing program has to be comprehensive and find people at the right times when they're interested in engaging with Chipotle. Chris, I don't know if you want to add anything.\nExecutives: Yes. I think you got to use all the tools at your disposal. There will certainly be some promotional things will continue [indiscernible] that we've done in the past. But overall, you'll see a pullback in promotional activity in favor of the more centralized marketing project awareness and hopefully transactions and traffic that will follow that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Matt McGinley from Evercore ISI.\nAnalysts: On the growth in the CapEx, Brian, I appreciate that the economic model of the restaurant and the top line is what supports future unit growth. But the development pipeline for units is not a short one typically. And as you guys [indiscernible] unit growth, but you've ramped up the investment in existing stores, remodels and investment in digital and things like that. But it doesn't sound like you want to put out a specific growth number or you would have done so. But does the present new unit run rate seem like that's the right pace of growth? Or -- and then I guess, secondly, is the investment you made in CapEx in those new stores, is that unique to 2018? Or is it something that we should expect more spending on, on existing units in the future?\nExecutives: Yes. Look, I think when we got to fall, we'll be in a better position to talk through exactly how we're seeing the new unit growth. But I think like what we said in the last earnings call, we see at or better in 2019. And to your point, the development pipeline is an 18-month pipeline. So what is good news is we're seeing great economic results in the new restaurants we're opening, and we're liking the economic model that we have in our current restaurants as we continue to see additional sales strength. And then your question on that CapEx as it was allocated in the big fix. The big fix is just add it's a big fix where we're coming in to probably make up for some time that we should be doing over time that we didn't. And so as a result, we are coming in and doing it. But I do think, going forward, what I think that's good to be important as we'll find ourselves following behind on our restaurants. That's something we don't want to repeat, but we'll be able to share more details on that probably around the fall.\nAnalysts: On the store closures, other than being unprofitable, is there a common theme on the age of the store location or the geography that amongst these 60 or so that you want to be closing?'\nExecutives: Not really. There's no common theme. [indiscernible]\nExecutives: No, they're all over the place. There are various ages. Some are a couple of years old. Some are 15 years old. We literally just called the list, found all the restaurants that were cash flow bleeders, went through to look at every single site, looked at probably the real estate quality of the team, the sales trend and we made a decision. And frankly, we don't close stores very often. So we didn't like closing, but these are ones that we just didn't see getting to or above breakeven for some period of time, but they're all relevant. There's not a thing that's broken with our approach to our real estate pipeline. It's just were random misses.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bittner from Oppenheimer and company.\nAnalysts: Chris, you made all the commentary today, but [indiscernible] give us a more detailed look into how you expect although these to impact the financials, whether that be through the established financial targets or goals or for something else? And then I have a follow-up.\nExecutives: The -- so look, we have not changed any of our expectations for the year. And then, I think, as we get through the state gate process with these various initiatives, we'll have high level of confidence but that performance looks like, which then obviously, as these things unfold, be will share with you the progress that we're making in the business. The point of today's conversation was to share with you the strategy for how we see the growth unfolding. And as we start to validate that growth, we will share with you how that's impacting all the financial targets and the subsequent pieces of the puzzle that come with it.\nAnalysts: Okay. And just as you set out to drive this top line strategy, I mean, should we expect all the incremental sales growth from this strategy to be highly incremental to profits and margins and just drive significant operating leverage? Or are we -- should we be expecting some type of in-store operating expense step-up to drive this strategy or capital expense step-up or whatnot just on the investment side?\nExecutives: Look, what we're looking for, obviously, incremental profitable growth. That's what we are, first and foremost, after. With that said, various initiatives are going to have varying degrees of incrementality. And what I'm excited about is -- the preliminary look is we've got a lot of exciting things that we're going to start putting through our stage gate process that are going to start validating increment of these programs are and then how that flows through the economic model. So yes, of course, the goal is incremental profitable sales growth. That's why we're betting these ideas.\nAnalysts: Understood. And then just final question for me. Just Brian, can you comment on moving the headquarters from Denver to Southern California? What are the primary benefits you expect to harness from this move?\nExecutives: Sure. I think, as we mentioned in here, we're going to be building more marketing, more digital, more menu, data analytics, varying areas of expertise. And we think we have the ability to really transform the organization in a faster fashion by relocating the company. So that's something we're doing it. And there's lots of talent on the West Coast and across the entire country that, frankly, wants to be a part of the Chipotle journey. So we're very excited about the restructuring, the relocation and the new culture and talent that we'll be building.\nOperator: Our next question comes from of the line of Chris O'Cull from Stiefel.\nAnalysts: It's actually Mitch on for Chris. A question about catering and the opportunity around that. You recently announced options for smaller groups in different pricing tiers. Curious, are you pleased with those effects of those actions? And are you pulling other initiatives to grow that business more marketing dollars behind it?\nExecutives: Go ahead, Chris.\nExecutives: We do catering as a big opportunity and highly increment opportunity. I think that the [indiscernible] package size and a price point is a little bit more accessible should open that even further and gives us more flexibility. It certainly is on our radar screen from a digital ordering standpoint. So we're racking and stacking that with all of the mobile and digital and delivery initiatives that we have. We will be putting dedicated resources against digital going forward because it's a good opportunity. So we think that with the rest of the suite, mobile and digital ordering and delivery and everything that catering is a key asset for us. And we'll see how this new rollout of the smaller one goes. And we'll [indiscernible] that deliver the most incremental profit for us. And we'll continue to evaluate others to help optimize those. So we love catering. We think we'll be awesome. We think it's a huge opportunity, and we'll just take the sequencing with everything else.\nAnalysts: Okay. And then just a follow-up question on loyalty. I'm curious whether you've done any studies to gauge consumer demand for this. And if so, what have they showed?\nExecutives: Yes, we have. And actually, this is one of the top consumer requests for Chipotle to provide. It's -- this is going to be one that's going to be a customer pleaser.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Gregory Francfort from Bank of America.\nAnalysts: I got 2 questions. The first is just after you do the tax write-off, I think part of the tax rate was staying the next couple of years is because the stock was down. Could you give us sort of write-off? What do you think's on racks and more from a bigger picture, Brian, how do you envision the operational flow of the line? And as you go out and test in these new store prototypes, are you going to be putting a new equipment for new products? And if so, where do you think that goes? And just any changes to the structure of flow of the line as you see it today or opportunities to kind of change that to improve the labor efficiency or anything along that line?\nExecutives: What don't I answer the second question, and I'll hand it over for Jack for the tax. To answer your question, any new item that we bring in, one of the things that I'm very focused on is today, the reason why we had $2 million AUV is because we sell burritos, bowls and tacos at a tremendous throughput. And that model has to be protected. So as I mentioned earlier, one of the key criteria is anything we bring in cannot cause us to go backwards from a throughput standpoint, okay? Now with that said, there's going to be products that we may introduce new equipment that, I think, will improve the experience for the customer when they order something that maybe doesn't go down the line the way it always has. We may have to put a piece of equipment in a different place so that you move from a customer-facing line where things are flowing to where it moves off, uses a piece of equipment then it gets back to that register an expediter in the right timing so that the flow is uninterrupted. And you see this happening a lot of other restaurants. And the key is, though, you have to take the time to make sure you understand the timing and motion involved with the new equipment and the new menu item. And so we're going to take that time. We're not going to rush it when you got something that is going to be a difference to the current line optimization that we have today. And an issue that utilizes the current line optimization [indiscernible] probably moved to the stage gate process a lot faster. So  yes, that is going to be the approach. But I just want to clarify. I mean, one of the things that is -- and I think I've said this in my remarks. One of the things that is exciting for me that I have discovered is just understanding how powerful this operating model is. The economics and the food and the team member experience that all happens with this line is a real gem, and we have to protect it. Unfortunately, one of the other gems we have is that second make-line, which allows us then to do a lot of this digital business, on-premise business without impacting that customer-facing line at all. If anything, it creates a lot more capacity in the restaurant, and it creates an even more attractive economic model when you start ramping up on that digital make-line or second make-line. So I'm really excited about how we can use technology, loyalty, access and some menu innovation to really, I think, drive incremental growth that helps us protect our throughput and hopefully improve on it. Jack, I don't know if you want to hit the tax.\nExecutives: Yes, Greg. Yes, our underlying tax rate is 28.8%, and I went through that in quite a bit of detail on the first quarter call. You might want to go back to the transcript on that. Our rate is going to be higher, in the high 30s. It was in high 30s in the first quarter. Will be about that rate in the fourth quarter. These are related to they're not economic, they're not cash. The thing I mentioned to do about a $10 million write-off, these are deferred tax assets that are put on the books within our stock with a much higher level. We're expecting with the restructuring that stock options are going to be -- they're going to be forfeited. They're vested, they're going to be forfeited as we restructure. So there's no tax deduction available. But there's also no expense available either of those options are not going to be exercised at all. It's just imperfection in the way accounting leaves expense on the books. Tax will never allow deduction when there is not an actual cost involved but these are noneconomic. They don't take out any cash of our balance sheet. And they're very difficult to predict. In a normal environment where the stock continues to increase, you won't see this type of stuff. As we see this upcoming, I warned you about it, we'll tell you about each quarter, about these unusual write-off of deferred tax assets.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Peter Saleh from BTIG.\nAnalysts: Brian, I think you touched on this in your last comment. But can you talk about the margin profile or maybe the throughput capability of that digital enhanced second make-line?\nExecutives: Well, I probably won't get into the specifics of the margin associated with it. But what I could tell you is it obviously runs with less labor.  It's in the 3 people needed in order to execute the second make-line versus 6 or 7 people on the customer-facing line at peak. So that obviously is a nice tailwind for the second make-line. And then the other piece that we love about it is the accuracy and the speed associated with using that second make-line is also another really powerful tool because now, with our second make-line, we can literally tell everybody, \"You know what, you can skip the line when you order online.\" That is going to be I think a powerful message in the Chipotle business going forward.\nAnalysts: And then just my last question. On the loyalty program, are you envisioning this to be a digital-only loyalty program? Or will this be some of the similar that you had in the past was with like a physical presence in the store?\nExecutives: I'm going to let Curt answer that one. He's the master of all things loyalty.\nExecutives: Peter, the loyalty program will be available in restaurant as well as online, but there will not be a physical card. So a customer will create an account, a loyalty account, digitally, and they can use their phone to present that account either on the register or, as Brian has said, the fastest way to order is to order digitally where that number will just be placed as part of that ordering process.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nick Setyan from Wedbush.\nAnalysts: Just on pricing as -- mincing digit labor inflation is ongoing, and food costs may not remain on [indiscernible] as they've been this year, how are you thinking about the pricing strategy going forward? And then just specifically, how are you thinking about pricing in 2019?\nExecutives: Yes, so we found [indiscernible] in our pricing for 2019. But our approach to pricing will be obviously looking at the metrics you just talked about, and then you obviously have to put the customer into that equation as well. So that's the approach we're going to be taking, understanding what's going on with our food costs and paper costs, combined with our labor costs and then managing that relative to what our customers' expectation is on a great value proposition and then also how much growth we foresee the business to also overcome some of the inflation. So we're going to take a comprehensive view, and we will approach it that way every year.\nAnalysts: And I guess, as a follow-up, maybe for Jack. As you kind of think about transaction growth, assuming there's no pricing in 2019, what kind of transaction growth do you think is necessary for us to delever at the unit level?\nExecutives: Yes. I mean, if you have some negative inflation, but if you have inflation like labor inflation, for example, of somewhere in the mid-single digits, which is what we've been running, you need to get like a mid-single-digit transaction-driven comp just to stay even on the restaurant cash flow line. You'll still delever on labor. But you'll make it up in some of the other line items and you'll hear about breakeven. So I think of this kind of environment, you have to be considering a combination of transaction growth and well-thought-out, as Brian mentioned, price increase to try to offset both so that as you're going transaction [indiscernible] macro margins.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Tower with Wells Fargo.\nAnalysts: I know it's getting late, so I'll try to be quick with these. Just first one for Jack. If you can quantify what the drag was or will be from those 55 to 65 stores that you're planning on closing. What sort of drag that was on store-level margins? Second, I guess, this is for Brian or Chris, in terms of making the brand more visible over time, is that going to require a higher spend going forward from a marketing standpoint? I think that's run roughly about 3% of sales historically. And then lastly, now that you're doing all this brand research in the early learnings, have you better determined where some of that lost traffic has gone since the food crisis? Meaning are there fast-casual brands or fast food?\nExecutives: Yes, I guess we'll take in the order, this is Jack, in the restaurant-level margin. Those restaurants were well under $1 million. They're all cash flow losers. When they're all fully closed, we should expect the margin improvement of 30 basis points or more. Now keep in mind, we're closing about half or so in the first month, and then the others will be -- happen over time as we negotiate with the leases. So this won't be -- this won't hit all at one time, but eventually, when they're all closed, we should pick up 30 basis points or perhaps a little more.\nAnalysts: Yes, it's Chris. I'll take the conversation about the overall marketing budget. I think that, you're right, we have about a 3% marketing budget. I think our opportunity certainly to short term is to be more efficient and effective to see the dollars that we have. But one of the beauties of having innovation pipeline is stage gate process [indiscernible] protocol is a contest varying levels. And so you have a much better certainty about what you're doing and as you go national once you've tested in a test market. So we'll simulate different levels of spending, and then we can decide as we go forward whether those delivered on what we wanted to or not. And so over time, you might be able to lean into some products and some products you may not. So I think that's part of the beauty of having a defined process and an innovation process and an innovation pipeline so that you can pick and choose what works the best. In terms of the question about where they went and who we source from, I think that's a big part of the financial research. I think one of the beauties of Chipotle, though, is that we have a great balance of getting consumers not only from just QSR and other fast-casual but even from casual dine, and also we have a great mix of both lemon. We have our reading the widely appealing brand, and I think that's a big opportunity for us to appeal to category users from a more centralized marketing standpoint than just a more decentralized promotional base marketing plan that we have in the past.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I now would like to turn the call back to management for closing remarks.\nExecutives: All right. Well, thank you, everybody. And hopefully, you have clarity on our strategy for how we're going to cultivate a better world and win today. And thank you for everybody's time and your interest in Chipotle. Have a good night.\nOperator: This concludes tonight's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.\nOperator: Greetings, and welcome to Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. Special Investor Call. [Operator Instructions] Today's presentation contains 2 videos. Audio during these videos will only be heard over the webcast and not over the telephone. Those listening via the phone will only experience silence during this time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. \nI would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Coralie Witter from Chipotle.\nExecutives: Hello, everyone, and welcome to our call today. Before we begin our presentation, I will remind everyone that part of our discussion today will include forward-looking statements as defined in the securities laws. These forward-looking statements will include statements regarding our strategy and initiatives to build sales and the expected sales opportunity represented by digital channels, statements about our unit economics, information relating to the anticipated restaurant closures, information relating to anticipated onetime costs and restructuring charges and statements regarding our future sales potential as well as other statements of our expectations and plans. These statements are based on information available to us today and we are not assuming any obligation to update them. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. We refer you to the risk factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K as updated in our subsequent Form 10-Qs for a discussion of these risks. \nI'd also like to remind everyone that we will not be providing any updates to our Q2 results to date or to our guidance. We have adopted a self-imposed quiet period that is in place following this call, restricting communications with investors until our Q2 earnings release scheduled for July 26. We will start today's call with some prepared remarks from Brian Niccol, Chief Executive Officer; Marissa Andrada, Chief HR Officer; Chris Brandt, Chief Marketing Officer; and Jack Hartung, Chief Financial Officer. We will allow plenty of time at the end of those remarks for questions. In the room and also available during the Q&A period are Scott Boatwright, Chief Restaurant Officer; Curt Garner, Chief Digital and Information Officer; and Laurie Schalow, Chief Communications Officer. \nBefore I turn the call over to Brian, I want to mention that the slides that will be shown during the webcast are also available on our website at chipotle.com in the Investor Relations section. And as a usability note, if you are accessing the webcast via a Chrome browser, you will need to hit the Play button when the slides appear on the webcast as the videos will not autoload. \nWith that, I'll turn it over to Brian.\nExecutives: Thanks, Coralie, and thanks to all of you joining us this afternoon and for your interest in Chipotle. As Coralie mentioned, we will not be talking about Q2 results today. Instead, we'll focus on our near-term and long-term strategy. But I will tell you that we are pleased with the underlying sales trends we are seeing as the sales trends from Q1 have continued into Q2. We're confident that the strategy we'll talk about today can accelerate our future growth. Our vision at Chipotle is to win today and cultivate a better future, and we will achieve that vision with a clear strategy, strong supporting structure and a new culture. \nSpecifically, today, we will talk about 5 focus areas that will drive sales and transactions as part of our growth turnaround: number one, becoming a more culturally relevant, engaging brand that builds love and loyalty; number two, digitizing and modernizing our restaurant experience that creates a more convenient and enjoyable guest experience; number three, running great restaurants with great hospitality and throughput; number four, being disciplined and focused to enhance our powerful economic model; and number five, building a great culture that can innovate and execute across digital, access, menu and the restaurant experience.\nBefore we dive deeper into those 5 focus areas, let me first share with you what I've learned about Chipotle since joining 3 months ago, a state of the union, if you will. First, I found a number of positives. As I mentioned in April, I've seen that consumers really love our brand. We can build on that and continue to create more distance between us and others. We don't believe anyone else has the quality of ingredients that drives great taste like we have, and now our marketing will lean into that to increase awareness and remind customers why they fell in love with Chipotle. \nWe also have an excellent value proposition that we can enhance across all dayparts and our new restaurant economics today are very strong. We have built a solid foundation and made progress in digital that we expect to accelerate in the coming months. Our second make-line is a significant competitive advantage that enables throughput and efficiency that enhances our economic model going forward. And finally, I'm very proud of the passionate people we have working in or supporting our roughly 2,500 restaurants that are responding enthusiastically to our new strategy. \nHowever, I also found that we have some gaps that we are actively addressing. There is a lack of discipline around priorities, process and accountability, and we are not sufficiently results focused, which made us reactive and hampered execution. I found skills gaps in many areas and insufficient data for decision making that have held us back from reaching our potential. There is no validated menu innovation pipeline, a general lack of customer understanding and no real process for scaling and commercializing innovation. \nAnd as you've heard me say before, the brand had been silent and lost some of its cultural relevance. I found that our marketing dollars had been inefficiently allocated, and we are working quickly to correct that. And lastly, in our restaurants, our throughput remains below potential, and we need to move consumers through the line of more quickly and deploy technology to help us do that.  \nI'm happy to report that all of this is changing. Organizationally, we are adding experienced, professional talent in many areas, including marketing, menu, digital, analytics and human resources. Our leaders will provide clear direction and roles will have defined accountabilities. We will invest in areas core to our strategy and be scrappy in looking for efficiency opportunities to fund our investments. \nFor example, we have flattened the organization with the removal of layers which, when combined with clear roles and responsibilities, will speed up decision making and drive better results. We are putting in place a clear governance structure for the organization to enable efficient execution. Importantly, we will build muscle around innovation by establishing a stage-gate process where we test, learn and iterate, so that when we roll out a new initiative, we are highly confident in the probabilities of success. Overall, we will transform into a learning organization that is decisive and one that constantly iterates to achieve our core objectives. \nTo give you a concrete example of what I'm talking about, I'd like to tell you about our new digital pickup shelves, which you can see on your screen. While the app experience that was rolled out late last year is best-in-class, in many of our restaurants, it is unclear to our customers where to pick up that order, which detracts from the experience. In our downtown Denver restaurant, we cut a window into our wall near the kitchen door not far from the register and put a digital pickup sign above it. That simple change caused a double-digit increase in our digital sales within the first few weeks, and it sustained. \nNot only did it provide a significantly faster and more convenient mobile order and pickup experience, but it served as in-store marketing that raised awareness among our customers standing in line. There's a big opportunity across all of our restaurants because over half of our customers aren't even aware that you can order ahead for pickup at Chipotle. We looked into adding windows in all restaurants, but quickly realized that with permitting and other issues it'd just take too long to roll out. So we hypothesized that we could get the same benefit with self-serve shelves and a sign overhead and get them rolled out much faster and more cost effective. \nWe have digital pickup shelf prototypes in a handful of restaurants as we speak and expect to expand into another test market this summer. These shelves unlock the power of our second make-line and accelerate our digital sales flywheel to drive more mobile and delivery orders and more group orders, in addition to increasing peak capacity in our restaurants by providing a relief valve for our very busy customer-facing service line.\nThis is just one great example. What else is changing at Chipotle? We will make the brand more engaging, more visible and more culturally relevant. In our restaurants, we will provide a great experience with great hospitality, food cooked to perfection with convenience enhancing fast throughput. Importantly, we will lean into the strengths we have, namely our 70,000 employees that are passionate, committed and working hard to make Chipotle better; our great-tasting classically cooked food made from real ingredients; our strong value proposition; our brand equity and our efficient and effective digitized second make-line.\nWe have a lot of work to do to win today and cultivate a better future. While I could not be more excited about the future of Chipotle, it's important to be patient and recognize that people and process changes don't happen overnight. We need to add talent, build and create muscle memory around processes and testing capabilities, and upgrade our enabling tools and technology. While we're doing that, we're focusing on the singles and doubles that can create short-term sales and transaction momentum, while we build capabilities behind larger opportunities. \nLooking at our team, we are fortunate that Curt Garner started building improved digital capabilities when he joined 2 years ago, and we are now enjoying some of the fruits of those efforts with digital sales at just under 9% in the first quarter. We have the ability to lean more heavily into our digital initiatives to drive further growth, as I'll describe later.\nWe are also fortunate that Scott Boatwright began restructuring the field organization last fall and is completing the final stages of this process. Additionally, we're investing in training to consistently deliver an outstanding guest experience, investing in our facilities to improve the appearance of our restaurants and in modernizing the tools our restaurants need to enable faster throughput, better efficiency and a better team experience in our restaurants. \nI'll turn it over to Marissa, our new Chief Human Resource Officer.\nExecutives: Thanks, Brian. I am personally delighted to be part of Chipotle and to support our over 70,000 employees. It's great to be here today with you on the call. We're excited about this unique opportunity to build a dynamic culture and lead Chipotle on its next and what we truly believe will be its most rewarding chapter. It's no secret that we're successful because of our people. We will deliver our strategy through a people and culture transformation. We will modernize the structure, build organizational capability, elevate our talent and leverage technology to provide our restaurants with world-class service levels from our support centers in Newport Beach and Columbus.\nWe are starting the creation of an organizational structure that we believe will allow us to best execute our strategy. As announced, this includes a reorganization where we will leverage technology to improve processes and align our work within our Newport Beach and Columbus support centers with a structure that will provide world-class service levels to our restaurants, and we'll streamline our structure to eliminate 2 layers to stay nimble and agile as we grow allowing us to reinvest in new capabilities and skills. It's our firm belief that the way to grow a company and to bring around the life is to grow its people. \nWe're building and bringing in new capabilities across the organization, including in marketing, menu, digital, analytics and human resources. Key aspects of our strategy are attracting, developing and inspiring best-in-class talent and cultivating an environment that inspires mutual learning and development. We will grow Chipotle by growing people. As part of our cultural DNA, we will codify our values to inspire curiosity, creativity and innovation. Our employee experience will be the foundation for our customer experience. As a team, we will be committed to driving accountability for performance in people at Chipotle, as this is critical to cultivating a better world. \nToday, our employees join and love working at Chipotle because they love our real food. In the future, we will create an environment where our employees will join Chipotle because they love our real food and that they belong in a company that unleashes their potential. I can't wait to embark upon the journey together. \nNow I'll turn it back to Brian.\nExecutives: Thanks, Marissa. We are happy to have you on the team. I'll take a moment to elaborate on the priorities that will be visible to our guests: running great restaurants, modernizing and digitizing our restaurants and becoming a more relevant and engaging brand. \nI've already discussed the roadmap that Scott Boatwright is executing to run our great restaurants. When we talk about modernizing and digitizing our restaurant, it means making it easier to access Chipotle. We want our guests to enjoy Chipotle whatever way is most convenient for them, whether it be through ordering and paying digitally ahead of time, through delivery or via group ordering options. \nOur digital sales are fast approaching $0.5 billion with very little marketing support. We believe that by increasing awareness of our mobile order-ahead feature and improving the in-store experience, we can accelerate the rate of digital sales growth, and our digitized second make-line has the capacity to handle significant increases in volume. Over time, we think this can be a multibillion dollar opportunity. \nI mentioned earlier the digital pickup shelves that we are testing can help unlock the potential of our digitized second make-line. For those of you that are new to Chipotle, our second make-line is a second production line in the back of our restaurant that looks and functions just like our front service line. We are now in the process of digitizing those second make-lines, as you can see on your screen. \nWhat that means is that instead of reading small font on paper receipts to assemble our orders, our crew now has 2 flat screens above the line with pictures that mirror the placement of the food on the line and lights up just the bins required to assemble an order. This results in much better throughput, greater capacity to build digital sales and even more importantly for our customers, much better accuracy.\nDelivery is a significant opportunity for us that also leverages the production capacity of our second make-line. In April, we added DoorDash as a new partner and we continue to expand a number of restaurants that all of our partners can deliver from. Our delivery business previously has been built with virtually no marketing. We learned this quarter, through joint efforts with both DoorDash and Postmates, that we can accelerate delivery growth simply through greater awareness and best-in-class delivery times. Later this summer, we will add delivery capabilities to our app so that the fastest way to deliver Chipotle to your chair is only a few clicks away. We will also continue to increase access by making group occasions more convenient for small and large groups alike. \nNow let's talk more about our great Chipotle brand. Being a relevant brand starts with insightful consumer understanding. We are investing in foundational customer research right now and this will help us refine our innovation strategies around marketing, digital, access, menu and restaurants. We'll have conclusions from that research this fall, but some of the early qualitative findings are encouraging, namely that our commitment to Food with Integrity is a key point of difference and our customers feel good about our delicious food. \nWe will build on the customer understanding that we are gaining with CRM capabilities and we will test the loyalty program that leverages those insights in the second half of this year, leading to a planned national launch in 2019. Our loyalty program will give us a currency with which to incent and reward trial and new behaviors. \nWe are also increasing our brand relevance by adding new occasions which our loyalty currency can support. The good news is that we have no value issue with our burritos, bowls and tacos. We can build on that strength and get people excited about snacking dayparts. For example, we are exploring a happy hour offering that enhances our value proposition during nonpeak snacking hours, with $2 tacos with a drink between 2:00 p.m. and 5:00 p.m. We're also exploring a similar offer for increased late-night sales after 8:00 p.m. \nAnother way to be more relevant to our consumers is with excitement around our menu. We think about menu innovation in 4 key ways: number one, what our customers tell us they want, like nachos and quesadillas we're experimenting with in a test kitchen; number two, items our customers tell us they want us to bring back like chorizo; number three, new items that can be unique to Chipotle like the frozen Mexican chocolate milkshake and the avocado tostada that are also in the test kitchen; and finally, number four, celebrating existing items that are already in our restaurants. \nFor example, many people don't know we have sofritas or what sofritas is. It's a great-tasting organic tofu cooked with our adobo blend for delicious vegetarian choice. The goal is to thoughtfully add delicious menu items that drive incrementality, are operationally easy to execute and enhance our ability to drive great throughput. We need to build capabilities in this area and build a pipeline utilizing a stage-gate process. You'll begin to see more tests in the second half of this year and you can expect relevant menu news in the coming quarters.\nFinally, we are changing the cultural narrative around our brand. We know we can drive growth by putting more effective and relevant marketing behind our innovative initiatives and by reminding people why they love Chipotle, being culturally relevant means being present in sports, fashion, technology and entertainment. \nI'll turn it over to Chris Brandt, our new Chief Marketing Officer, to elaborate on how he is positioning to Chipotle to be more engaging and more culturally relevant.\nExecutives: Thanks, Brian. Before I talk about some of the early progress we've made, I just want to say I'm thrilled to be a part of Chipotle. It's early days for me, but I've never seen a brand that has more purpose and more passionate than Chipotle. Cultivate a Better World isn't just a slogan on a wall, it lives in the hearts of our employees and their pride in serving people responsibly sourced, classically cooked, delicious food you feel good about eating. Many consumers feel that same passion as well. There is such a unique emotional component to this brand stemming from its authenticity and transparency about food that we need to reinforce and reignite. \nTo that end, our ultimate marketing mission is to make Chipotle not just a food brand but a purpose-driven lifestyle brand. What do I mean by that? Chipotle will become a brand that people want to know about, want to be a part of and want to wear as a badge. I genuinely believe that Chipotle can transcend the food category, separate itself from everyone else and be a category of one because there are now compromises with Chipotle. No one has such great-tasting food that you feel good about eating like we do.\nTo accomplish that mission of making Chipotle a lifestyle brand, we need to change our approach and evolve our marketing philosophy and our tactics. We need to strike a balance of traffic driving, short-term wins and long-term growth that we call winning today and cultivating a better future. We need to celebrate our food and ingredients and expand our reach with consumers. We need to be culturally relevant and a part of the conversation. We need to show people we can have some fun because when a brand has a purpose, is visible and is doing fun things that are part of culture, people are more interested in it and want to be a part of it. That's how you become a lifestyle brand. \nWe've already taken some steps in that direction. Our latest advertising campaign was put together in my first couple of weeks and was a noticeable pivot from prior work. We celebrated the food, showed how craveable it is and we also demonstrated a little bit of our personality and sense of humor. Let's watch.\n[Presentation]\nExecutives: The data we have from third-parties result in anecdotal evidence that shows these ads were very well received by consumers. Not only did we change our creative direction in a matter of weeks, we also changed the media plan to feature broader reach in popular programs. We advertise in signature, culturally relevant programs like the NBA playoffs and season finales of top shows across a variety of networks. We also linked to sponsorship with a top gaming team playing Fortnite, easily the hottest video game right now that is taking the nation by storm. These actions not only got us heightened awareness with consumers, but our team members also saw them. One of my favorite quotes was from a team member who saw the ads on TV and said, \"I love them. It feels like we are back on the front foot again. That's awesome.\"  \nBut there is much, much more to come. We are shifting our marketing from a field-based, promotion-driven approach to a centralized strategy featuring broader reach with category users. Our goal is to make our marketing dollars more efficient and effective and most importantly, help drive traffic. The foundational consumer research Brian mentioned will give us better insight in consumers. We're putting a stage-gate process in place with dedicated resources to help validate new product and promotional ideas. We're working with our agency partners to develop innovative creative that is focused on celebrating Food with Integrity and the real ingredients that make Chipotle great. \nWe're rolling out a new tagline this fall that's a perfect fit for the brand. We're developing innovative media plans with key partners to reach consumers in unique ways across both traditional and digital channels. We're going to expand the awareness of mobile ordering and delivery or, as we call it, the easiest way to Chipotle. We're going to be more engaging in social media. Already, 2 of our recent Instagram posts are the most liked in Chipotle history. Overall, we're going to be a much more agile, innovative and visible brand that people will talk about. \nAgain, I'm thrilled to be part of Chipotle. We've made a ton of progress in the last few months, but the best is yet to come. Brian, back over to you.\nExecutives: Thanks, Chris. We expect that all of these initiatives across marketing, digital, consumer access, menu, analytics and operations combined will create a flywheel that can drive transactions to accelerate our growth. To put it another way, we will amplify our unique positioning, real ingredients, real cooking, real opportunity and now through our new strategy, real performance. \nI'll turn over to Jack now to discuss the short-term financial implications of the restructuring we are undertaking to execute on and align behind the strategy that will unlock our brand's potential.\nExecutives: Thanks, Brian. Before I begin, I want to remind everyone that we're not providing a financial update on our current quarter and we're not updating or reaffirming the guidance provided on our last earnings call. \nEverything you've heard today about our focus on running great restaurants, modernizing and digitizing our restaurants and becoming a more relevant and engaging brand is designed to drive transactions, improve our unit economics, accelerate our earnings growth and create significant shareholder value. While it's too early to predict the timing and precise impact each of these strategies will have on result, I'm confident that the strategies will lead to higher average unit volumes and higher margins in the future. \nAll of these opportunities are going through a new stage-gate process designed to ensure successful rollouts. As we move through those stage gates over the coming year, we'll have a better understanding around the timing of when these new initiatives will translate to sales growth. In the meantime, we know that a combination of great operations, clever marketing and pushing further into our digital initiatives will drive near-term sales growth.\nExecuting these strategies at a high level will require changes to our organization and to our culture, and that will result in nonrecurring charges during the second quarter and over the next few quarters. We'll clearly call out these nonrecurring charges as they're incurred each quarter so that you will have a clear perspective of the underlying progress we're making in our business results. These nonrecurring costs primarily relate to the moving of our offices, the restructuring of our organization and the closing of underperforming restaurants. \nIn aggregate, we expect these costs to be in the range of $115 million to $135 million. Of that amount, we expect about $50 million to $60 million will hit the second quarter. And while most of the remaining charges will hit in 2018, there will likely be some charges, particularly related to terminating restaurant and office leases that will spill into 2019. As a result of our review of underperforming restaurants, we expect to close between 55 and 65 restaurants, including the 5 Pizzeria Locale restaurants located outside of Denver. \nThe second quarter charge will include about $30 million related to restaurant asset write-offs, while the lease buyout costs for these restaurants will be charged over the next several quarters. About half of the restaurants will close within the next 30 days, and the remainder will close over the next several quarters as we negotiate lease buyouts with our landlords. The nonrecurring costs will primarily be reflected in 3 line items: G&A, the loss on disposal and impairment of assets and depreciation and we'll clearly call these out -- these charges out each quarter.\nIn addition to the $115 million to $135 million estimated charges, we'll also write-off about $10 million in deferred tax assets over the next few quarters as fully vested, but underwater stock options will expire as we complete the restructure of the organization. This deferred tax write-off will hit our tax rate and is in addition to the tax rate impact we discussed on our Q1 call. \nWe'll provide more color on the quarterly timing of all future nonrecurring costs when we have more certainty around that timing. In future earnings calls and releases, our quarterly disclosures will clearly breakout onetime costs from normal recurring costs so you can follow the underlying trends. We're confident that following these strategies would lead to better customer experience, stronger customer loyalty, better unit economics and the creation of significant shareholder value.\nI'll now turn the call back over to Brian.\nExecutives: Thanks, Jack. When I first spoke to you on our Q1 call, I shared how excited I was about the opportunity to lead Chipotle in its next chapter of growth and to build on a strong foundation of a well-loved brand that has a ton of growth optionality and one of the best economic models in the industry. As Jack mentioned, driving transaction growth is the single biggest lever enhancing our economic model, but we will also be scrappy and find efficiencies to add a tailwind to our economic model. \nThe combination of top line growth and margin expansion will ultimately lead to increased store growth, and I could not be more excited about the future of Chipotle. Capitalizing on that opportunity requires us to build a new culture of creativity, action and accountability. The realignment of the organization we are undertaking this year is a significant effort. And while it is potentially disruptive in the short term, it is good for our customers and our shareholders and will result in a much stronger organization that is structured to innovate and execute successfully to win today and cultivate a better future, and to capitalize on the wealth of opportunities for many years to come. I can easily see a future where Chipotle more than doubles revenue to over $10 billion. \nSo as I've outlined today, our 5 focus areas that will drive sales and transactions as part of our growth turnaround: number one, becoming a more culturally relevant and engaging brand that builds love and loyalty; number two, digitizing and modernizing our restaurant experience that creates a more convenient and enjoyable guest experience; number three, running great restaurants with great hospitality and throughput; number four, being disciplined and focused to enhance our powerful economic model; and number five, building a great culture that can innovate and execute across digital, access, menu and the restaurant experience.\nOkay. Before we open up the call to questions, I'd like to show you a quick video clip of the Chipotle of the future.\n[Presentation]\nExecutives: We have our executive leadership team here with us today available to answer your questions. As a reminder, we will discuss our second quarter results on our July 26 earnings call. And we'll now open up the line for questions regarding our strategic outlook. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Nicole Miller from Piper Jaffray.\nAnalysts: Appreciate the update. I find it very fascinating how you talk about the brand previously being somewhat silent, and I want to understand if you've measured perhaps aided versus unaided awareness or some other measure, and how will you be measuring the relevancy going forward beside the obvious same-store sales performance?\nExecutives: Sure. So this is Brian. So what we've been tracking is we have a brand tracker that tracks both top-of-mind awareness as well as kind of what people are saying about the brand. And what we have seen, now it's a fairly new study that started back in February, so we don't have that much historical data on it, is an opportunity to improve from where we are today. We also, as I mentioned in the call, we've just placed a foundational study which is going to give us some key metrics on the brand that we'll be tracking going forward. And we're going to use the combination, obviously, of sales performance, top-of-mind awareness and then some key brand metrics that we'll be defining once we've finalized all this foundational research that's coming back.\nAnalysts: And then you also mentioned you're not at peak transactions and I think I was measuring it earlier today around just over 400 on about 1.9 million AUV in the $12 to $13 average check. And I think, historically, there were stores that, at peak, could do that maybe in an hour, so just a quick 2-part question. Do you get more transactions by extending hours? Or do you get more transactions at peak? And I was just curious to know how does the system do at peak? What are the number of transactions currently?\nExecutives: Yes. I'll answer this and then I can have Scott chime in as well. But we believe there's more opportunity for transactions at peak, so moving people through the line faster, and that goes back to what Scott really has implemented around things where people are clear on the roles and their accountabilities in being positioned so they're ready for the throughput that they're capable of doing. So that's what we're focused on. Scott, do you want to add anything?\nExecutives: Thanks, Brian. Nicole, I think it's something that we have really only begun to put a shoulder against over the last couple of months and we still have much work to do to really move our restaurants in the pace with which we moved prior. And so there's a lot of work going on from a training perspective to ensure we're focused on the right things as it relates to shift management overall at Chipotle, something we've got to do a better job of teaching, which a key component of is faster throughput. So more on that to come, but it is a high priority for us and something we're working against as we speak.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Tarantino from Baird.\nAnalysts: Brian, my question is about your growth outlook for the next few years, and one thing you didn't mention is how you're thinking about unit growth over that horizon. And I guess, as you think about the opportunity to improve the economic model, what do you need to see to either accelerate the growth or continue the type of growth that you've outlined for this year? And then I have a follow-up question about the restaurant economic model. I think you mentioned that there are opportunities to drive some efficiency to provide a tailwind to that model, so could you just elaborate on what you meant by that statement as well.\nExecutives: Sure. So your first question regarding new units and the pace of development. First of all, the new unit economics we're getting right now are, I think, best-in-class. They're still returning north of 30%, so we're very optimistic about the new stores that we're opening. I will tell you, we'll -- the pace will increase as the business continues to recover the top line sales, and I think that is something that we're going to be smart about on how we ratchet that up going forward because the good news is the returns are there. And I think as the core business really gets itself back to a place of where it was performing, we can also then, at the same time, start enhancing the new unit development. So that's going to be the approach we're going to take, David. On your second question around efficiencies and the economic model for adding additional tailwind, this is really to the point of our culture where we're going to get a little scrappier on how we approach things. And obviously, the number one way for us to see that margin expand is through the top line sales growth, but I think there are also some opportunities for us to get scrappy as we look at business on how we're spending our money and the areas where they're being spent on. So those are really the components that we're going to be looking at to make sure that we really maximize the economic model of the business.\nAnalysts: And then just a quick follow-up, maybe it's for you or for Jack. Any way to size up the opportunity on the costs side, either at the unit level and then you also, I think, mentioned that you're cutting out a few layers in the G&A structure. Should we think about those as opportunities that flow through to the bottom line or is that sort of an area where you cut and then reinvest somewhere else? So at least any thoughts on that at this stage.\nExecutives: Yes. David, this is Jack. On the G&A, the savings are going to be reinvested. We'll have a leaner, more nimble organization. You heard Brian talked about we got skills gaps. We've already been filling a lot of those skills gaps, so I would say it's going to be reinvestment. G&A, we think about that as being similar. Once we get through some of these onetime charges, it'll similar to percent of sales to what we've had in the past, I would say that excluding stock comp, so it's going to be reinvestment. The reinvestment is going to really be reinvested in things that will drive our growth. In terms of economic model and what we can do for efficiency, it's too early to tell. I think it's more of a culture and an attitude. We're going to focus on fewer things, and the fewer things will either drive growth or they will enhance the economic model. And I think by focusing on these fewer things, we're going to expect we're going to get results. But as we identify the opportunities, David, in the coming quarters, we'll share more with you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore from Bernstein.\nAnalysts: I have one follow-up to an earlier question and then a question on technology. The follow-up was the goal of both improving throughput and then menu innovation and maybe adding items. And I think, historically, there was some sense internally that maybe those were inconsistent. So just is the answer technology? Is it what you're talking about in terms of really defining people's roles and where they should be? Or I guess, how do we reconcile what has always been known as a very simple model where it felt like every time something was added, for example, queso, something else had to come out with what we're hearing in terms of menu innovation? And then I have another question.\nExecutives: Sure. So obviously, one of the key criteria for us as we go through the stage-gate process with any new menu item is going to be the impact on throughput, whether it improves throughput because we've added new capability with equipment or some technology advancement, meaning it moves to the second make-line, something along those lines. But one of the key criteria for anything to get to the national phase is going to be a throughput element. And what we've seen is there are some menu items that we believe have a high probability of having no impact on throughput. There are other menu items that are going to come with the requirement of probably some equipment investment and a real understanding of how do we tweak the process if we wanted to be able maintain the same level throughput that we have today. So obviously, the second one that I just talked about is going to take a little bit longer from a testing and a validation standpoint than a menu item that has no impact on throughput or the process or equipment. So that's where the stage-gate process becomes a very important piece of the puzzle, so that we really understand the impact on our operations, the consumer and the team member and then, obviously, the financials. So we'll be leaning into that stage-gate process to ensure we find the power of throughput and innovation.\nAnalysts: Understood. And then just on the technology piece. I thought I heard you say you're going to add delivery capabilities to your app, and I think that's something that no one else yet has done in terms of the companies partnering with third party. It has been companies with in-house delivery that have been able to do that. So I mean, maybe talk about how you've leapfrogged some of what we've seen elsewhere or whether you think that is going to be a meaningful distinction between what we're seeing with other restaurants that are partnering with third-party aggregators.\nExecutives: Yes. So I'll hand it over to Curt, but let me answer your couple of questions there. Obviously, one of the things we're really excited about with delivery is our model results in food that gets delivered with great speed. And one of the things that we're really excited about in our DoorDash partnership is we saw that speed first-hand relative to all your other food alternatives on the DoorDash website. So we're very excited about the idea of being able to once you're in our app, stay in the app and get people the access opportunity to have Chipotle delivered to their home because I think people are going to be excited about the speed at which they can get Chipotle delivered to them. I don't know if we're the only ones with delivery in our app, but I'll hand it over to Curt to see if he wants to add anything.\nExecutives: Yes, I'll just -- I'll follow up by saying we're really excited, Sara, about this launch and those tests coming in later in the year. And as Brian has said, we're a learning organization now. So it's early days, and we're excited to see how customers respond and how we can continue to make digital the easiest way to Chipotle.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Glass from Morgan Stanley.\nAnalysts: My first question is just simply a time line question. Brian, when should we expect to start to see the results of some of these initiatives coming into play, specifically in the back half of this year? Is that an unreasonable expectation? Do you expect, for example, a product launch in the third quarter? And is there something on the marketing front? You talked about a lot about pieces and a lot of need to rebuild some capabilities. So what's a reasonable expectation of the type -- 2 or 3 examples of things that should happen inside of this year, let's say?\nExecutives: Yes. So what I can definitely share with you is you're going to start to see us testing programs in the back half of this year. So you'll see these tests happening in -- with some food ideas. You'll see some tests happening with digital, loyalty. And we're very excited about all those. Now depending on how things perform in that stage-gate process, we'll dictate the time table for which we roll it out because one of the things that I think is important for the organization is we iterate, we listen, we learn before we then decide to go with a national launch. So we're in the early days of validating these propositions. And once we start moving them through the stage-gate process, we'll be sharing when they will actually be hitting the national programs going forward.\nAnalysts: Okay. So I guess, go slow to go fast, in other words, to make sure that you're getting them right when you launch them.\nExecutives: That's correct.\nAnalysts: Okay. And then remodels was discussed last call or maybe 2 calls ago as something that's a '19 effort. Maybe that was before you arrived. Do you look at the businesses needing a substantial remodel or light remodel? Or how do you view the physical assets? And how do you phase that into these other initiatives?\nExecutives: Yes. So we have an initiative called the big fix, and that is happening. I'm happy to say we're on track to be finished by the end of this year. I think we're exactly 50% of the way done right now. And this is really where we are bringing our -- all of our restaurants up to date. It's fixing the lights, the painting. It brings them back to, I would say, a Class 1 restaurant experience. Separate from that, we also have an effort going on with a redesign, which is kind of the Chipotle restaurant of the future. And that is going to be -- you'll see that coming into some testing in the back half of this year. Probably right around the fall time frame, you'll see us going into New York City.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia from William Blair.\nAnalysts: It's Sharon Zackfia, but that was a good try. I guess, a couple of questions. Now that digital is up to around 9% of sales, I'm just wondering if you've been able to harness that data at all and kind of incent consumer behavior in different ways. I don't know where you are on that. And then if you could give us some perspective, once you launch loyalty, kind of when you'll be able to use that data to then kind of create new customer behavior. And then lastly, I don't think you mentioned international at all. So if there's any thought on what to do with the international locations.\nExecutives: Sure. So your first question around digital and loyalty and, I guess, more importantly, the data approach to remarketing or incentivizing our customers. That's absolutely part of our approach going forward. One of the things I'm really excited about as we get this pilot going with our loyalty program, we're going to start to move to, really, the tailored data-specific marketing that then can use the currency in the rewards program to drive certain behaviors, incent certain products, incent certain experiences. And we think that's going to be a key unlock for the business going forward because as this business goes from 10% plus in digital sales, that presents an opportunity for us to have more customers in our business, engaging at a different level than they have in the past. And then when you layer on top of that a loyalty program with a strong CRM engine, I think really exciting things will be unlocked as we roll out loyalty on a national basis in 2019. Your second question was on international. For now, international is something that we are managing. It's not an aggressive part of our plan for growth. We're focusing the aggressive growth in the U.S. business, and that's why we outlined this right now.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Karen Holthouse from Goldman Sachs.\nAnalysts: Two questions that go back to some of the prepared remarks. There is a comment on opportunities to enhance the value proposition across dayparts. And then I think as it relates to value, the only specific thing mentioned was a happy hour test. Are there other things you're looking at in terms of pricing or sizing in other dayparts versus that -- really, more of a comment on the overall customer experience potentially layering in loyalty? And then second, it would seem like some of this sort of foundational consumer research is really going to feed back into some of these tests and other strategy. How long is it until you think you get sort of the base level of data in place for that?\nExecutives: Sure. So your first question on the value and how we see that playing out. You're exactly right. We see using our rewards program as a great way to present targeted value and incentives for customers when they want it, where they want it and how they want it. Combine that with then providing some value that matches up with a daypart like the happy hour, which matches more of like a snacking occasion, I think, then we have to provide the right value equation for a snacking occasion between the hours of 3:00 to 5:00 p.m. So those are our lead-in ideas. And then, obviously, a key piece of the puzzle is always understanding our price equation as well. And what will be important is we'll continue to make sure we understand how consumers are interacting with the menu and where we see opportunities to enhance our value proposition. We will do it in a smart fashion. Your second question on the timing of the consumer foundational research. Yes, absolutely, this will inform pretty much the entire business. And we're really excited. We're going to start getting some of the preliminary results back here in the next month, and then we'll have the entire package back by the time we did the fall. So we're already starting to get some learnings back. And it's very exciting because it's new knowledge for the company, and it's new insight into our customers, which I think is going to be hugely valuable for us going forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe from JPMorgan.\nAnalysts: A couple of follow-ups. Firstly, when you make delivery available on your app, what percentage of stores will that currently cover?\nExecutives: Oh, right. So are -- you're talking about the in-app delivery experience? What is that percentage, Curt?\nAnalysts: Yes, exactly.\nExecutives: John, to start, we will be covering approximately 1,500 restaurants and expect to get to around 2,000 restaurants by the end of the year.\nAnalysts: Okay, perfect. That's a big number. Secondly, Jack, I think, a question for you. I mean, you mentioned G&A being similar as a percentage of sales into the path, excluding executive comp. The path has actually shown some variability in terms of G&A, and obviously, executive stock comp -- executive comp is actually a big percentage of that. So as we think about '19 and '20, post the move, some of the restructurings and some of the hires, I mean, can you help us just get closer to a number in terms of what G&A should be as a percentage of sales for a company of this size? And that excludes -- and including stock comp.\nExecutives: Well, including the stock comp, it's tough only because when the stock moves, stock comp moves pretty dramatically as well. So the thing we can control is the underlying G&A that we spend on people, offices, things like that. I think, as we get through a lot of these nonrecurring charges, our current underlying G&A is in the, call it, low 5% to mid-5% range. When you add in stock comp, you're in the mid- to high 6s or something like that. I think that, as we get through, all of these adjustments with our offices and our structure will still be in that same kind of range. Now once we get to that range, as we build sales with the strategies that you've heard today, we've been able to lever G&A in the past, and I expect we'll be able to leverage G&A in the future. I think the important thing is that our G&A will be in a similar pattern. What's really going to drive is we're going to drive top line sales that will drive our margins, that will drive unit economics. And that's where I think most of our shareholder value is going to come from.\nAnalysts: And then 2 quick ones. Brian, to your previous experience and that especially on the operating side, how do you think about the right prime cost, food and paper plus labor for Chipotle? I mean, that's a line that's actually changed quite a lot over the course of the history of this company, but do you think about it at the 60% range? Do you think about it at 55%, somewhere in between? I mean, is there is something that you think about on the prime cost side in terms of what this business should be over the course of the cycle?\nExecutives: Yes, John, this is Jack. Right now, we're in kind of the 60% range. Our model works quite well. We're in the 60% range, but you know very well that it wasn't not long ago we were in the 55% range. And that's how you get margins in the mid- to high 20% range. We have the ability to get back to that, but it all depends on the top line. And so the strategies that you've heard today are very heavily weighted towards the driving the top line, bringing customers in, making the brand relevant again. If we do all that well, we have the ability to get those prime costs back into some of our historical ranges.\nAnalysts: And that's a very important point. And then finally, when you mentioned $10 billion of your sales for the Chipotle U.S. brand, how many stores does that contemplate in your current thinking in terms of optimizing that portfolio?\nExecutives: Yes. Look, the way we think about it is you could easily be around 5,000 stores at some point while we're exceeding $10 billion.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays.\nAnalysts: Two questions. First, just Brian, I know you talked about being pleased with the underlying sales trends. Just wondering from our side of the seat, and the compares obviously difficult to read, the 1, the 2 year. Just wondering, what measures do you focus on perhaps daily or weekly or monthly, whether it's variability by geography or daypart or product line? We're just trying to figure out how you define success in your seat in terms of the comp growth. And then I had a follow-up on the supply chain.\nExecutives: Sure. So look, we are watching sales and transactions every day, and we look at it by region and by daypart. And what we continue to see is good performance in all the dayparts. And we're optimistic that the continued improvement in throughput and operational execution will continue to support the sales trends that we've seen to date. And then obviously, going forward, the plan is to accelerate the sales and transactions with the initiatives that we put through the stage-gate process that then we have a high level of confidence that we'll grow business. So that's what we're looking at. That's the scorecard we keep an eye on, on a daily basis. The other key thing we also look at it is obviously what percent of our business is growing through the [ second and eight month ] because, I guess, it's an indicator of how we're doing on driving our digital and off-premise business.\nAnalysts: Got you. And just separately on the supply chain side of things. I mean, there was a mention of Food with Integrity and that you talked about authenticity and transparency, which sounds like conference calls from years past. Just wondering, how much time have you spent focused on the supply chain? Maybe what changes do you think need to come? Obviously, there's big risk in the supply chain, and as you enhance kind of new products and whatnot, I'm just wondering your thoughts on the supply, [ saying changes ] that have been put in place and what we should expect going forward.\nExecutives: Yes, sure. So a couple of things. One, I think I mentioned this in my prepared remarks. Maybe I didn't. But we've hired a new supply chain leader. And it's probably the first time in a long time that we've had, what I would call, a real expert in supply chain space leading our supply chain efforts. He's 2, maybe 3 weeks into the job now. Very excited about him getting into the role and helping us figure out our next chapter on how we work with our suppliers and partners on our supply chain. And then to answer our question, my ability to get out and meet some folks. I've had the opportunity to meet with our 2 of our bigger partners, OSI and Miniat. And the thing that I love about our partnerships is they're as equally excited about the food as we are. And to have that commitment to that quality is usually valuable. And then obviously, we'll figure out how we queue it in the most sufficient fashion. But when you have that shared value of commitment to quality and excellence and Food with Integrity and really trying to move things to another level, it makes for a powerful partnership. So I'm very excited about Carlos joining the work, and I'm very excited about my early conversations with some of our key suppliers.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Charles from Cowen and Co.\nAnalysts: It's actually Brian Vieten on for Andrew. And if I could just ask maybe 2 around digital. So in terms of the app, as we look out kind of the adoption curve, what do you guys view as sort of the biggest hurdles to break into the fray in sort of offering consumers a compelling reason to download the app? The confidence is always -- is encouraging, but thus far, we've kind of seen this as a challenge, not only for fast-casual, but sort of the broader restaurant industry. And then in your answer to Sara, I believe, it sounded like maybe once customers download the app, delivery could drive sort of deeper engagement with the app. But what are the bigger hurdles you see to breaking through the fray and driving that adoption on an in-house app? And just secondly, from a marketing perspective, in the spirit of moving away from promotions and more towards a centralized approach, from a delivery or mobile app perspective, does that mean marketing will center more so on media ads? Or could that have more of a promotional element?\nExecutives: Sure. So look, I think our biggest hurdle on the app, frankly, is just awareness. Right now, I think, I was just looking at the numbers, but more than 50%, I think it's like 52% of people aren't even aware that we have an a pp. And I think this goes back to the question somebody asked me earlier, why do you believe the brand isn't as visible as it should be? It's things like this that are, I think, key growth engines for the business that we just have really low awareness on. So job number one is to get people aware of the app because I think they're going to love the experience, based on the users that are already in the app. And then job two is how do you get them to continue to use it. Well, I think that a key is to continue to provide utility in that app, adding things like delivery, adding a loyalty program. These are things that will continue to provide utility for them because then what we'll be able to do is get into this game of one-to-one communication and really change the level of engagement with our customer through that app experience. So it's going to be a combination of things that, I think, ultimately, move the app forward. But I think the biggest challenge for us first and foremost is making people aware that they have the app. Then you know that it's the experience that gives them a reason to keep using it, right? So the whole experience then is just superior to anything else they've seen where when they order, they pick it up, the order is accurate, the speed is like nothing they've seen. If it's getting delivered, it's at a level of speed that they haven't seen, with accuracy that they haven't seen and then, obviously, layer in the idea of loyalty. I think you start building utility for why people are going to adopt the usage over time. What was your second question?\nAnalysts: Great. Yes, just secondly, just from a marketing perspective, I know you guys have talked about sort of moving away from promotions and sort of more towards a centralized marketing approach. But just from a delivery or mobile app adoption perspective, just wondering, does that mean the marketing, to get those sign-ups, will center more so on sort of media ads? Or could that have a more of a promotional element of maybe a coupon or something to that effect?\nExecutives: What we're going to be moving towards is programs that, I think, are going to engage and connect at a different level than we have in the past. And how we choose to connect will be driven by the users that we're trying to persuade with the experience that we provide. So you're going to see us be very present in digital, mobile, all the nontraditional mediums. And you're also going to see us show up in the traditional mediums because, I think, at the end of the day, and Chris, feel free to chime in here, we want to be relevant and engaged with all category users like medium and heavy. And to do that, that means our marketing program has to be comprehensive and find people at the right times when they're interested in engaging with Chipotle. Chris, I don't know if you want to add anything.\nExecutives: Yes. I think, look, we'll. You got to use all the tools at your disposal. And there will certainly be some promotional things. We'll continue some of the promotional things that we've done in the past. But overall, you'll see a pullback in promotional activity in favor of the more centralized marketing and barraging awareness and, hopefully, transactions and traffic that will follow that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Matt McGinley from Evercore ISI.\nAnalysts: On the unit growth and the CapEx, and Brian, I appreciate that the economic model of the restaurant and the top line is what supports future unit growth. But the development pipeline for units is not a short one, typically. And this year, you guys had slowed the unit growth, but you ramped up the investment in existing stores, remodels and just investment in digital and things like that. But it doesn't sound like you want to put out a specific growth number or you would have done so. But does the present new unit run rate seem like that's the right pace of growth? Or -- and then I guess, secondly, is the investment that you made in CapEx in those new stores, is that unique to 2018, or is it something that we should expect more spending on, on existing units in the future?\nExecutives: Yes. Look, I think when we get to the fall, we'll be in a better position to talk through exactly how we're seeing the new unit growth. But I think, like we said in the last earnings call, we see at or better in 2019. And to your point, the development pipeline is an 18-month pipeline. So what is good news is we're seeing great economic results in the new restaurants we're opening, and we're liking the economic model that we have in our current restaurants as we continue to see additional sales strength. And then your question on the CapEx as it was allocated in the big fix. The big fix is just that, it's a big fix, where we're coming in to probably make up for some time that we should have been doing it over time that we didn't. And so as a result, we are coming in and doing it. But I do think, going forward, one of the things that's going to be important is we don't find ourselves falling behind on our restaurants. That's something we don't want to repeat, but we'll be able to share more details on that front probably around the fall.\nAnalysts: And on the store closures, other than being unprofitable, is there a common theme on the age of the store, the location or the geography that -- amongst these 60 or so that you're going to wind up closing?\nExecutives: Not really. There's no common theme. I don't -- Jack, I don't know if you want to add anything to that.\nExecutives: Yes. No, they're all over the place. They're of various ages. Some are a couple of years old. Some are 15 years old. We literally just called the list, found all the restaurants that were cash flow bleeders, went through to look at every single site, looked at quality of the real estate, quality of the team, the sales trend, and we made a decision. And frankly, we don't close stores very often, so we didn't like closing these, but these are ones that we just didn't see getting to or above breakeven for some period of time. But they were all over the place. There's nothing that's broken with our approach to our real estate pipeline. These just were random misses.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bittner from Oppenheimer and Company.\nAnalysts: But do you plan, at any point, to give us a more detailed look into how you expect all of this to impact the financials, whether that be through the establishment of financial targets or goals or for something else? And then I have a follow-up.\nExecutives: The -- so look, we have not changed any of our expectations for the year. And then, I think, as we get through the stage-gate process for these various initiatives, we'll have a high level of confidence with what that performance looks like, which then obviously, as these things unfold, we will share with you the progress that we're making in the business. The point of today's conversation was to share with you the strategy for how we see the growth unfolding. And as we start to validate that growth, we will share with you how that's impacting all the financial targets and the subsequent pieces of the puzzle that come with it.\nAnalysts: Okay. And just as you set out to drive this top line strategy, I mean, should we expect all the incremental sales growth from this strategy to be highly incremental to profits and margins and just drive significant operating leverage? Or are we -- should we be expecting some type of in-store operating expense step-up to drive this strategy or capital expense step-up or whatnot just on the investment side?\nExecutives: Look, what we're looking for, obviously, is incremental profitable growth, right? That's what we are first and foremost after. With that said, various initiatives are going to have varying degrees of incrementality. And what I'm excited about is -- the preliminary look is we've got a lot of exciting things that we're going to start putting through our stage-gate process that it's going to start validating how incremental these programs are and then how that flows through the economic model. So -- but yes, of course, the goal is incremental, profitable sales growth. That's why we're vetting these ideas.\nAnalysts: Understood. And just final question for me. Just, Brian, can you comment on moving the headquarters from Denver to Southern California? What are the primary benefits you expect to harness from this move?\nExecutives: Sure. I think, as we mentioned in here, we're going to be building more marketing, more digital, more menu, data analytics, varying areas of expertise. And we think we have the ability to really transform the organization in a faster fashion by relocating the company. So that's the [ precipitous ] for doing it. And there's lots of talent on the West Coast and across the entire country that, frankly, wants to be a part of the Chipotle journey. So we're very excited about the restructuring, the relocation and the new culture and talent that we'll be building.\nOperator: Our next question comes from of the line of Chris O'Cull from Stifel.\nAnalysts: It's actually Mitch on for Chris. A question about catering and the opportunity around that. You recently announced options for smaller groups in different pricing tiers. Curious, are you pleased with those effects of those actions? And are you pulling other initiatives to grow that business, perhaps putting more marketing dollars behind it?\nExecutives: Go ahead, Chris.\nExecutives: We view catering as a big opportunity and a highly increment opportunity. I think that they -- drilling down to a package size and a price point that's a little bit more accessible should open up that market even further and give us some more flexibility. It certainly is on our radar screen from a digital ordering standpoint. So we're just racking and stacking that with all of the mobile and digital and delivery initiatives that we have. We will be putting dedicated resources against digital going forward because we do think it's a good opportunity. So we think that in -- with the rest of the suite, mobile and digital ordering and delivery and everything, that catering is a key aspect for us. And we'll see how this new rollout of this smaller one goes. And we'll pour the gas to tanks that deliver the most incremental profit for us. And we'll continue to evaluate others to help optimize those. So we love catering. We think it will be awesome. We think it's a huge opportunity, and we'll just take and sequence it with everything else.\nAnalysts: Okay. And then just a follow-up question on loyalty. I'm curious whether you have done any studies to gauge consumer demand for this. And if so, what have they showed?\nExecutives: Yes, we have. And actually, this is one of the top consumer requests for Chipotle to provide. It's a -- this is going to be [ a realm ] that's going to be a customer pleaser.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Gregory Francfort from Bank of America.\nAnalysts: I got 2 questions. The first is, just after you do the tax write-off, I think part of the reason the tax rate was staying the next couple of years is because the stock was down. What -- if you sort of write that off, what do you think this ongoing tax rate's going to be? And then more from a bigger picture, Brian, how do you envision the operational flow of the line? And as you go out and test in these new store prototypes, are you going to be putting in new equipment for new products? And if so, where do you think that goes? And just any changes to the structure of flow of the line as you see it today or opportunities to kind of change that to improve the labor efficiency or anything along that line.\nExecutives: Well, why don't I answer the second question, and I'll hand it over to Jack on the tax. So to answer your question, any new item that we bring in, one of the things that I'm very cognizant of is today, the reason why we have $2 million AUVs is because we're selling burritos, bowls and tacos at a tremendous throughput. And that model has to be protected. So as I mentioned earlier, one of the key criteria is anything we bring in cannot cause us to go backwards from a throughput standpoint, okay? Now with that said, there's going to be products that we may introduce new equipment that, I think, will improve the experience for the customer when they order something that maybe doesn't go down the line the way it always has. We may have to put a piece of equipment in a different place so that you move from a customer-facing line where things are flowing to where it moves off, uses a piece of equipment but then gets back to that register and expediter in the right timing so that the flow is uninterrupted. And you see this happen in a lot of other restaurants. And the key is, though, you have to take the time to make sure you understand the time and motion involved with the new equipment and the new menu item. And so we're going to take that time. We're not going to rush it when you got something that is going to be a difference to the current line optimization that we have today. And the initiative that utilizes the current line optimization probably will be able to move through the stage-gate process a lot faster. So yes, that is going to be the approach. But I just want to clarify. I mean, one of the things that is -- and I think I've said this in my remarks. One of the things that is exciting for me that I discovered is just better understanding how powerful this operating model is. The economics and the food and the team member experience that all happens with this line is a real gem, and we have to protect it. Unfortunately, one of the other gems we have is that second make-line, which allows us then to do a lot of this digital business, off-premise business, without impacting that customer-facing line at all. If anything, it creates a lot more capacity in the restaurant, and it creates an even more attractive economic model when you start ramping up on that digital make-line, or second make-line. So I'm really excited about how we can use technology, loyalty, access and some menu innovation to really, I think, drive incremental growth that helps us protect our throughput and, hopefully, improve on it. Jack, I don't know if you want to get the tax.\nExecutives: Yes, Greg. Chris was volunteering, but I'll take it, Chris. Yes, Greg, our underlying tax rate is 28.8%, and I went through that in quite a bit of detail on the first quarter call. So you might want to go back to the transcript on that. Our rate is going to be higher, in the high 30s. It was in high 30s the first quarter. It will be about that rate in the fourth quarter. These are related to -- they're not economic. They're not cash. The thing I mentioned today about a $10 million write-off, these are deferred tax assets that were put on the books when our stock was in a much higher level. We're expecting with the restructuring that stock options are going to be -- they're going to be forfeited. They're vested, they're going to be forfeited as we restructure. So there's no tax deduction available. But there's also no expense available either. Those options are not going to be exercised at all. It's just an imperfection in the way accounting leaves the expense on the books. Tax will never allow a deduction when there is not an actual cost involved and so -- but these are noneconomic. They don't take out any cash out of our balance sheet. And they're very difficult to predict. In a normal environment where the stock continues to increase, you won't see this type of stuff. As we see this stuff upcoming, I'll warn you about it, and we'll tell you about it each quarter, about these unusual write-off of deferred tax assets.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Peter Saleh from BTIG.\nAnalysts: Brian, I think you touched on this in your last comment. But can you talk about the margin profile or maybe the throughput capability of that digitally enhanced second make-line?\nExecutives: Well, I probably won't get into the specifics of the margin associated with it. But what I can tell you is it obviously runs with less labor. It's in the 3 people needed in order to execute the second make-line versus 6 or 7 people on the customer-facing line at peak. So that obviously is a nice tailwind for the second make-line. And then the other piece that we love about it is the accuracy and the speed associated with using that second make-line is also another really powerful tool because now, with our second make-line, we can literally tell everybody, \"You know what, you can skip the line when you order online.\" And that's going to be, I think, a powerful message in the Chipotle business going forward.\nAnalysts: And then just my last question. On the loyalty program, are you envisioning this to be a digital-only loyalty program? Or will this be something similar to what you had in the past with like a physical presence in the store?\nExecutives: I'm going to let Curt answer that one. He's the master of all things loyalty.\nExecutives: Peter, the loyalty program will be available in restaurant as well as online, but there will not be a physical card. So a customer will create an account, a loyalty account, digitally, and they can use their phone to present that account either on the register or, as Brian has said, the fastest way to order is to order digitally where that number will just be placed as part of that ordering process.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nick Setyan from Wedbush.\nAnalysts: Just on pricing, as mid-single-digit labor inflation is ongoing, and food costs may not remain as benign as they've been this year. How are you thinking about your pricing strategy going forward? And then just specifically, how are you thinking about pricing in 2019?\nExecutives: Yes, so we don't have any decisions on our pricing for 2019. But our approach to pricing will be, obviously, looking at the metrics you just talked about, and then you obviously have to put the customer into that equation as well. So that's the approach we're going to be taking: understanding what's going on with our food costs and paper costs, combined with our labor costs and then managing that relative to what our customers' expectation is on a great value proposition and then also how much growth we foresee the business to also overcome some of the inflation. So we're going to take a comprehensive view, and we will approach it that way every year.\nAnalysts: And I guess, just a follow-up maybe for Jack. As you kind of think about transaction growth, assuming there's no pricing in 2019, what kind of transaction growth do you think is necessary for us to be able to delever at the unit level?\nExecutives: Yes. I mean, if you have -- it depends on the inflation. But if you have inflation of like labor inflation, for example, of somewhere in the mid-single digits, which is what we've been running, you need to get like a mid-single-digit, transaction-driven comp just to stay even on the restaurant cash flow line. You'll still -- you'll delever on labor, but you'll make it up in some of the other line items, and you'll about break even. So I think, in this kind of environment, you have to be considering a combination of transaction growth and a well-thought-out, as Brian mentioned, price increase to try to offset both so that as you're growing transactions, you'll at least hold at macro margins.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Tower with Wells Fargo.\nAnalysts: I know it's getting late, so I'll try to be quick with these. Just first one for Jack. If you can quantify what the drag was or will be from those 55 to 65 stores that you're planning on closing, what sort of drag that was on store-level margins. Second, I guess, this is for Brian or Chris. In terms of making the brand more visible over time, is that going to require a higher spend going forward from a marketing standpoint? I think that's run roughly about 3% of sales, historically. And then lastly, now that you're doing all this brand research in the early learnings, have you better determined where some of that lost traffic has gone since the food crisis, meaning are there fast-casual brands or fast food? That's it.\nExecutives: Yes, I guess, we'll take in order. This is Jack. In the restaurant-level margin, those restaurants were well under $1 million. They were all cash flow losers. When they're all fully closed, we should expect a margin improvement of 30 basis points or more. Now keep in mind, we're closing about half or so in the first month, and then the others will be -- happen over time as we negotiate with the leases. So this won't be -- this won't hit all at one time, but eventually, when they're all closed, we should pick up 30 basis points or perhaps a little more.\nExecutives: Yes, it's Chris. I'll take the conversation about the overall marketing budget. I think that, you're right, we have about a 3% marketing budget. I think our opportunity, certainly in the short term, is to be more efficient and effective with the existing dollars that we have. But one of the beauties of having an innovation pipeline in the stage-gate process and a testing protocol is that you can test varying levels and so you have a much better certainty about what you're doing and as you go national once you've tested it in a test market. So we'll simulate different levels of spending, and then we can decide as we go forward whether those delivered on what we wanted to or not. And so over time, you might be able to lean into some products, and some products, you may not. So I think that's part of the beauty of having a defined process and an innovation process and an innovation pipeline, so that you can pick and choose what works the best. In terms of the question about where they went and who we source from, I think that's a big part of the foundation of research. I think one of the beauties of Chipotle, though, is that we have a great balance of getting consumers not only from just QSR and other fast-casual but even from casual dine, and also, we have a great mix of both men and women. So it's a really widely appealing brand, and I think that's a big opportunity for us to appeal to category users from a more centralized marketing standpoint than just a more decentralized promotional base marketing plan that we've had in the past.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I now would like to turn the call back to management for closing remarks.\nExecutives: All right. Well, thank you, everybody. And hopefully, you have clarity on our strategy for how we're going to cultivate a better world and win today. And thank you for everybody's time and your interest in Chipotle. Have a good night.\nOperator: This concludes tonight's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.\nOperator: Greetings, and welcome to Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. Special Investor Call. [Operator Instructions] Today's presentation contains 2 videos. Audio during these videos will only be heard over the webcast and not over the telephone. Those listening via the phone will only experience silence during this time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. \nI would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Coralie Witter from Chipotle.\nExecutives: Hello, everyone, and welcome to our call today. Before we begin our presentation, I will remind everyone that parts of our discussion today will include forward-looking statements as defined in the securities laws. These forward-looking statements will include statements regarding our strategy and initiatives to build sales and the expected sales opportunity represented by digital channels, statements about our unit economics, information relating to the anticipated restaurant closures, information relating to anticipated onetime costs and restructuring charges and statements regarding our future sales potential as well as other statements of our expectations and plans. These statements are based on information available to us today and we are not assuming any obligation to update them. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. We refer you to the risk factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K as updated in our subsequent Form 10-Qs for a discussion of these risks. \nI'd also like to remind everyone that we will not be providing any updates to our Q2 results to date or to our guidance. We have adopted a self-imposed quiet period that is in place following this call, restricting communications with investors until our Q2 earnings release scheduled for July 26. We will start today's call with some prepared remarks from Brian Niccol, Chief Executive Officer; Marissa Andrada, Chief HR Officer; Chris Brandt, Chief Marketing Officer; and Jack Hartung, Chief Financial Officer. We will allow plenty of time at the end of those remarks for questions. In the room and also available during the Q&A period are Scott Boatwright, Chief Restaurant Officer; Curt Garner, Chief Digital and Information Officer; and Laurie Schalow, Chief Communications Officer. \nBefore I turn the call over to Brian, I want to mention that the slides that will be shown during the webcast are also available on our website at chipotle.com in the Investor Relations section. And as a usability note, if you are accessing the webcast via a Chrome browser, you will need to hit the Play button when the slides appear on the webcast as the videos will not autoload. \nWith that, I'll turn it over to Brian.\nExecutives: Thanks, Coralie, and thanks to all of you joining us this afternoon and for your interest in Chipotle. As Coralie mentioned, we will not be talking about Q2 results today. Instead, we'll focus on our near-term and long-term strategy. But I will tell you that we are pleased with the underlying sales trends we are seeing as the sales trends from Q1 have continued into Q2. We're confident that the strategy we'll talk about today can accelerate our future growth. Our vision at Chipotle is to win today and cultivate a better future, and we will achieve that vision with a clear strategy, strong supporting structure and a new culture. \nSpecifically, today, we will talk about 5 focus areas that will drive sales and transactions as part of our growth turnaround: #1, becoming a more culturally relevant, engaging brand that builds love and loyalty; #2, digitizing and modernizing our restaurant experience that creates a more convenient and enjoyable guest experience; #3, running great restaurants with great hospitality and throughput; #4, being disciplined and focused to enhance our powerful economic model; and #5, building a great culture that can innovate and execute across digital, access, menu and the restaurant experience.\nBefore we dive deeper into those 5 focus areas, let me first share with you what I've learned about Chipotle since joining 3 months ago, a state of the union, if you will. First, I found a number of positives. As I mentioned in April, I've seen that consumers really love our brand. We can build on that and continue to create more distance between us and others. We don't believe anyone else has the quality of ingredients that drives great taste like we have, and now our marketing will lean into that to increase awareness and remind customers why they fell in love with Chipotle. \nWe also have an excellent value proposition that we can enhance across all dayparts and our new restaurant economics today are very strong. We have built a solid foundation and made progress in digital that we expect to accelerate in the coming months. Our second make-line is a significant competitive advantage that enables throughput and efficiency that enhances our economic model going forward. And finally, I'm very proud of the passionate people we have working in or supporting our roughly 2,500 restaurants that are responding enthusiastically to our new strategy. \nHowever, I also found that we have some gaps that we are actively addressing. There is a lack of discipline around priorities, process and accountability, and we were not sufficiently results focused, which made us reactive and hampered execution. I found skills gaps in many areas and insufficient data for decision making that have held us back from reaching our potential. There is no validated menu innovation pipeline, a general lack of customer understanding and no real process for scaling and commercializing innovation. \nAnd as you've heard me say before, the brand had been silent and lost some of its cultural relevance. I found that our marketing dollars had been inefficiently allocated, and we are working quickly to correct that. And lastly, in our restaurants, our throughput remains below potential, and we need to move consumers through the line more quickly and deploy technology to help us do that. \nI'm happy to report that all of this is changing. Organizationally, we are adding experienced, professional talent in many areas, including marketing, menu, digital, analytics and human resources. Our leaders will provide clear direction and roles will have defined accountabilities. We will invest in areas core to our strategy and be scrappy in looking for efficiency opportunities to fund our investments. \nFor example, we have flattened the organization with the removal of layers which, when combined with clear roles and responsibilities, will speed up decision making and drive better results. We are putting in place a clear governance structure for the organization to enable efficient execution. Importantly, we will build muscle around innovation by establishing a stage-gate process where we test, learn and iterate, so that when we roll out a new initiative, we are highly confident in the probabilities of success. Overall, we will transform into a learning organization that is decisive and one that constantly iterates to achieve our core objectives. \nTo give you a concrete example of what I'm talking about, I'd like to tell you about our new digital pickup shelves, which you can see on your screen. While the app experience that was rolled out late last year is best-in-class, in many of our restaurants, it is unclear to our customers where to pick up that order, which detracts from the experience. In our downtown Denver restaurant, we cut a window into our wall near the kitchen door not far from the register and put a digital pickup sign above it. That simple change caused a double-digit increase in our digital sales within the first few weeks, and it sustained. \nNot only did it provide a significantly faster and more convenient mobile order and pickup experience, but it served as in-store marketing that raised awareness among our customers standing in line. There's a big opportunity across all of our restaurants because over half of our customers aren't even aware that you can order ahead for pickup at Chipotle. We looked into adding windows in all restaurants, but quickly realized that with permitting and other issues, it'd just take too long to roll out. So we hypothesized that we could get the same benefit with self-serve shelves and a sign overhead and get them rolled out much faster and more cost effective. \nWe had digital pickup shelf prototypes in a handful of restaurants as we speak and expect to expand into another test market this summer. These shelves unlock the power of our second make-line and accelerate our digital sales flywheel to drive more mobile and delivery orders and more group orders, in addition to increasing peak capacity in our restaurants by providing a relief valve for our very busy customer-facing service line.\nThis is just 1 great example. What else is changing at Chipotle? We will make the brand more engaging, more visible and more culturally relevant. In our restaurants, we will provide a great experience with great hospitality, food cooked to perfection with convenience enhancing fast throughput. Importantly, we will lean into the strengths we have, namely our 70,000 employees that are passionate, committed and working hard to make Chipotle better; our great-tasting classically cooked food made from real ingredients; our strong value proposition; our brand equity and our efficient and effective digitized second make-line.\nWe have a lot of work to do to win today and cultivate a better future. While I could not be more excited about the future of Chipotle, it's important to be patient and recognize that people and process changes don't happen overnight. We need to add talent, build and create muscle memory around processes and testing capabilities, and upgrade our enabling tools and technology. While we're doing that, we're focusing on the singles and doubles that can create short-term sales and transaction momentum, while we build capabilities behind larger opportunities. \nLooking at our team, we are fortunate that Curt Garner started building improved digital capabilities when he joined 2 years ago, and we are now enjoying some of the fruits of those efforts with digital sales at just under 9% in the first quarter. We have the ability to lean more heavily into our digital initiatives to drive further growth, as I'll describe later.\nWe are also fortunate that Scott Boatwright began restructuring the field organization last fall and is completing the final stages of this process. Additionally, we're investing in training to consistently deliver an outstanding guest experience, investing in our facilities to improve the appearance of our restaurants and in modernizing the tools our restaurants need to enable faster throughput, better efficiency and a better team experience in our restaurants. \nI'll turn it over to Marissa, our new Chief Human Resource Officer.\nExecutives: Thanks, Brian. I am personally delighted to be part of Chipotle and to support our over 70,000 employees. It's great to be here today with you on the call. \nWe're excited about this unique opportunity to build a dynamic culture and lead Chipotle on its next and what we truly believe will be its most rewarding chapter. It's no secret that we're successful because of our people. We will deliver our strategy through a people and culture transformation. We will modernize the structure, build organizational capability, elevate our talent and leverage technology to provide our restaurants with world-class service levels from our support centers in Newport Beach and Columbus.\nWe are starting the creation of an organizational structure that we believe will allow us to best execute our strategy. As announced, this includes a reorganization where we will leverage technology to improve processes and align our work within our Newport Beach and Columbus support centers with a structure that will provide world-class service levels to our restaurants, and we'll streamline our structure to eliminate 2 layers to stay nimble and agile as we grow, allowing us to reinvest in new capabilities and skills. It's our firm belief that the way to grow a company and to bring around a life is to grow its people. \nWe're building and bringing in new capabilities across the organization, including in marketing, menu, digital, analytics and human resources. Key aspects of our strategy are attracting, developing and inspiring best-in-class talent and cultivating an environment that inspires mutual learning and development. We will grow Chipotle by growing people. As part of our cultural DNA, we will codify our values to inspire curiosity, creativity and innovation. Our employee experience will be the foundation for our customer experience. As a team, we will be committed to driving accountability for performance in people at Chipotle, as this is critical to cultivating a better world. \nToday, our employees join and love working at Chipotle because they love our real food. In the future, we will create an environment where employees will join Chipotle because they love our real food and that they belong in a company that unleashes their potential. I can't wait to embark upon the journey together. \nNow I'll turn it back to Brian.\nExecutives: Thanks, Marissa. We are happy to have you on the team. I'll take a moment to elaborate on the priorities that will be visible to our guests: running great restaurants, modernizing and digitizing our restaurants and becoming a more relevant and engaging brand. \nI've already discussed the roadmap that Scott Boatwright is executing to run our great restaurants. When we talk about modernizing and digitizing our restaurant, it means making it easier to access Chipotle. We want our guests to enjoy Chipotle whatever way is most convenient for them, whether it be through ordering and paying digitally ahead of time, through delivery or via group ordering options. \nOur digital sales are fast approaching $0.5 billion with very little marketing support. We believe that by increasing awareness of our mobile order-ahead feature and improving the in-store experience, we can accelerate the rate of digital sales growth, and our digitized second make-line has the capacity to handle significant increases in volume. Over time, we think this can be a multibillion-dollar opportunity. \nI mentioned earlier the digital pickup shelves that we are testing can help unlock the potential of our digitized second make-line. For those of you that are new to Chipotle, our second make-line is a second production line in the back of our restaurant that looks and functions just like our front service line. We are now in the process of digitizing those second make-lines, as you can see on your screen. \nWhat that means is that instead of reading small font on paper receipts to assemble our orders, our crew now has 2 flat screens above the line with pictures that mirror the placement of the food on the line and lights up just the bins required to assemble an order. This results in much better throughput, greater capacity to build digital sales and even more importantly for our customers, much better accuracy.\nDelivery is a significant opportunity for us that also leverages the production capacity of our second make-line. In April, we added DoorDash as a new partner and we continue to expand a number of restaurants that all of our partners can deliver from. Our delivery business previously has been built with virtually no marketing. We learned this quarter, through joint efforts with both DoorDash and Postmates, that we can accelerate delivery growth simply through greater awareness and best-in-class delivery times. Later this summer, we will add delivery capabilities to our app so that the fastest way to deliver Chipotle to your chair is only a few clicks away. We will also continue to increase access by making group occasions more convenient for small and large groups alike. \nNow let's talk more about our great Chipotle brand. Being a relevant brand starts with insightful consumer understanding. We are investing in foundational customer research right now and this will help us refine our innovation strategies around marketing, digital, access, menu and restaurants. We'll have conclusions from that research this fall, but some of the early qualitative findings are encouraging, namely that our commitment to Food with Integrity is a key point of difference and our customers feel good about our delicious food. \nWe will build on the customer understanding that we are gaining with CRM capabilities and we will test the loyalty program that leverages those insights in the second half of this year, leading to a planned national launch in 2019. Our loyalty program will give us a currency with which to incent and reward trial and new behaviors. \nWe are also increasing our brand relevance by adding new occasions which our loyalty currency can support. The good news is that we had no value issue with our burritos, bowls and tacos. We can build on that strength and get people excited about snacking dayparts. For example, we are exploring a happy hour offering that enhances our value proposition during nonpeak snacking hours, with $2 tacos with a drink between 2 p.m. and 5 p.m. We're also exploring a similar offer for increased late-night sales after 8 p.m. \nAnother way to be more relevant to our consumers is with excitement around our menu. We think about menu innovation in 4 key ways: #1, what our customers tell us they want, like nachos and quesadillas we're experimenting with in a test kitchen; #2, items our customers tell us they want us to bring back like chorizo; #3, new items that can be unique to Chipotle like the frozen Mexican chocolate milkshake and the avocado tostada that are also in the test kitchen; and finally, #4, celebrating existing items that are already in our restaurants. \nFor example, many people don't know we have sofritas or what sofritas is. It's a great-tasting organic tofu cooked with our adobo blend for a delicious vegetarian choice. The goal is to thoughtfully add delicious menu items that drive incrementality, are operationally easy to execute and enhance our ability to drive great throughput. We need to build capabilities in this area and build a pipeline utilizing a stage-gate process. You'll begin to see more tests in the second half of this year and you can expect relevant menu news in the coming quarters.\nFinally, we are changing the cultural narrative around our brand. We know we can drive growth by putting more effective and relevant marketing behind our innovative initiatives and by reminding people why they love Chipotle. Being culturally relevant means being present in sports, fashion, technology and entertainment. \nI'll turn it over to Chris Brandt, our new Chief Marketing Officer, to elaborate on how he is positioning Chipotle to be more engaging and more culturally relevant.\nExecutives: Thanks, Brian. Before I talk about some of the early progress we've made, I just want to say I'm thrilled to be a part of Chipotle. It's early days for me, but I've never seen a brand that has more purpose and more passion than Chipotle. Cultivate a Better World isn't just a slogan on a wall; it lives in the hearts of our employees and their pride in serving people responsibly sourced, classically cooked, delicious food you feel good about eating. Many consumers feel that same passion as well. There is such a unique emotional component to this brand stemming from its authenticity and transparency about food that we need to reinforce and reignite. \nTo that end, our ultimate marketing mission is to make Chipotle not just a food brand but a purpose-driven lifestyle brand. What do I mean by that? Chipotle will become a brand that people want to know about, want to be a part of and want to wear as a badge. I genuinely believe that Chipotle can transcend the food category, separate itself from everyone else and be a category of one because there are no compromises with Chipotle. No one has such great-tasting food that you feel good about eating like we do.\nTo accomplish that mission of making Chipotle a lifestyle brand, we need to change our approach and evolve our marketing philosophy and our tactics. We need to strike a balance of traffic driving, short-term wins and long-term growth that we call winning today and cultivating a better future. We need to celebrate our food and ingredients and expand our reach with consumers. We need to be culturally relevant and a part of the conversation. We need to show people we can have some fun because when a brand has a purpose, is visible and is doing fun things that are part of culture, people are more interested in it and want to be a part of it. That's how you become a lifestyle brand. \nWe've already taken some steps in that direction. Our latest advertising campaign was put together in my first couple of weeks and was a noticeable pivot from prior work. We celebrated the food, showed how crave-able it is and we also demonstrated a little bit of our personality and sense of humor. Let's watch.\n[Presentation]\nExecutives: The data we had from third-parties result in anecdotal evidence that shows these ads were very well received by consumers. Not only did we change our creative direction in a matter of weeks, we also changed the media plan to feature broader reach in popular programs. We advertise in signature, culturally relevant programs like the NBA playoffs and season finales of top shows across a variety of networks. We also linked to sponsorship with a top gaming team playing Fortnite, easily the hottest video game right now that has taken the nation by storm. These actions not only got us heightened awareness with consumers, but our team members also saw them. One of my favorite quotes was from a team member who saw the ads on TV and said, \"I love them. It feels like we are back on the front foot again. That's awesome.\" \nBut there is much, much more to come. We are shifting our marketing from a field-based, promotion-driven approach to a centralized strategy featuring broader reach with category users. Our goal is to make our marketing dollars more efficient and effective and most importantly, help drive traffic. The foundational consumer research Brian mentioned will give us better insight in consumers. We're putting a stage-gate process in place with dedicated resources to help validate new product and promotional ideas. We're working with our agency partners to develop innovative creative that is focused on celebrating Food with Integrity and the real ingredients that make Chipotle great. \nWe're rolling out a new tagline this fall that's a perfect fit for the brand. We're developing innovative media plans with key partners to reach consumers in unique ways across both traditional and digital channels. We're going to expand the awareness of mobile ordering and delivery or, as we call it, the easiest way to Chipotle. We're going to be more engaging in social media. Already, 2 of our recent Instagram posts are the most liked in Chipotle history. Overall, we're going to be a much more agile, innovative and visible brand that people will talk about. \nAgain, I'm thrilled to be part of Chipotle. We've made a ton of progress in the last few months, but the best is yet to come. \nBrian, back over to you.\nExecutives: Thanks, Chris. We expect that all of these initiatives across marketing, digital, consumer access, menu, analytics and operations combined will create a flywheel that can drive transactions to accelerate our growth. To put it another way, we will amplify our unique positioning, real ingredients, real cooking, real opportunity and now through our new strategy, real performance. \nI'll turn over to Jack now to discuss the short-term financial implications of the restructuring we are undertaking to execute on and align behind the strategy that will unlock our brand's potential.\nExecutives: Thanks, Brian. Before I begin, I want to remind everyone that we're not providing a financial update on our current quarter and we're not updating or reaffirming the guidance provided on our last earnings call. \nEverything you've heard today about our focus on running great restaurants, modernizing and digitizing our restaurants and becoming a more relevant and engaging brand is designed to drive transactions, improve our unit economics, accelerate our earnings growth and create significant shareholder value. While it's too early to predict the timing and precise impact each of these strategies will have on result, I'm confident that the strategies will lead to higher average unit volumes and higher margins in the future. \nAll of these opportunities are going through a new stage-gate process designed to ensure successful rollouts. As we move through those stage gates over the coming year, we'll have a better understanding around the timing of when these new initiatives will translate to sales growth. In the meantime, we know that a combination of great operations, clever marketing and pushing further into our digital initiatives will drive near-term sales growth.\nExecuting these strategies at a high level will require changes to our organization and to our culture, and that will result in nonrecurring charges during the second quarter and over the next few quarters. We'll clearly call out these nonrecurring charges as they're incurred each quarter so that you will have a clear perspective of the underlying progress we're making in our business results. These nonrecurring costs primarily relate to the moving of our offices, the restructuring of our organization and the closing of underperforming restaurants. \nIn aggregate, we expect these costs to be in the range of $115 million to $135 million. Of that amount, we expect about $50 million to $60 million will hit the second quarter. And while most of the remaining charges will hit in 2018, there will likely be some charges, particularly related to terminating restaurant and office leases, that will spill into 2019. As a result of our review of underperforming restaurants, we expect to close between 55 and 65 restaurants, including the 5 Pizzeria Locale restaurants located outside of Denver. \nThe second quarter charge will include about $30 million related to restaurant asset write-offs, while the lease buyout costs for these restaurants will be charged over the next several quarters. About half of the restaurants will close within the next 30 days, and the remainder will close over the next several quarters as we negotiate lease buyouts with our landlords. The nonrecurring costs will primarily be reflected in 3 line items: G&A, the loss on disposal and impairment of assets, and depreciation, and we'll clearly call these out -- these charges out each quarter.\nIn addition to the $115 million to $135 million estimated charges, we'll also write off about $10 million in deferred tax assets over the next few quarters as fully vested, but underwater stock options will expire as we complete the restructure of the organization. This deferred tax write-off will hit our tax rate and is in addition to the tax rate impact we discussed on our Q1 call. \nWe'll provide more color on the quarterly timing of all future nonrecurring costs when we have more certainty around that timing. In future earnings calls and releases, our quarterly disclosures will clearly break out onetime costs from normal recurring costs so you can follow the underlying trends. We're confident that following these strategies would lead to better customer experience, stronger customer loyalty, better unit economics and the creation of significant shareholder value.\nI'll now turn the call back over to Brian.\nExecutives: Thanks, Jack. When I first spoke to you on our Q1 call, I shared how excited I was about the opportunity to lead Chipotle in its next chapter of growth and to build on a strong foundation of a well-loved brand that has a ton of growth optionality and one of the best economic models in the industry. As Jack mentioned, driving transaction growth is the single biggest lever enhancing our economic model, but we will also be scrappy and find efficiencies to add a tailwind to our economic model. \nThe combination of top line growth and margin expansion will ultimately lead to increased store growth, and I could not be more excited about the future of Chipotle. Capitalizing on that opportunity requires us to build a new culture of creativity, action and accountability. The realignment of the organization we are undertaking this year is a significant effort. And while it is potentially disruptive in the short term, it is good for our customers and our shareholders and will result in a much stronger organization that is structured to innovate and execute successfully to win today and cultivate a better future, and to capitalize on the wealth of opportunities for many years to come. I can easily see a future where Chipotle more than doubles revenue to over $10 billion. \nSo as I've outlined today, our 5 focus areas that will drive sales and transactions as part of our growth turnaround: #1, becoming a more culturally relevant and engaging brand that builds love and loyalty; #2, digitizing and modernizing our restaurant experience that creates a more convenient and enjoyable guest experience; #3, running great restaurants with great hospitality and throughput; #4, being disciplined and focused to enhance our powerful economic model; and #5, building a great culture that can innovate and execute across digital, access, menu and the restaurant experience.\nOkay. Before we open up the call to questions, I'd like to show you a quick video clip of the Chipotle of the future.\n[Presentation]\nExecutives: We have our executive leadership team here with us today available to answer your questions. As a reminder, we will discuss our second quarter results on our July 26 earnings call. And we'll now open up the line for questions regarding our strategic outlook. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Nicole Miller from Piper Jaffray.\nAnalysts: Appreciate the update. I find it very fascinating how you talk about the brand previously being somewhat silent, and I want to understand if you've measured perhaps aided versus unaided awareness or some other measure, and how will you be measuring the relevancy going forward beside the obvious same-store sales performance?\nExecutives: Sure. So this is Brian. So what we've been tracking is we have a brand tracker that tracks both top-of-mind awareness as well as kind of what people are saying about the brand. And what we have seen, now it's a fairly new study that started back in February, so we don't have that much historical data on it, is an opportunity to improve from where we are today. We also, as I mentioned in the call, we've just placed a foundational study which is going to give us some key metrics on the brand that we'll be tracking going forward. And we're going to use the combination, obviously, of sales performance, top-of-mind awareness and then some key brand metrics that we'll be defining once we've finalized all this foundational research that's coming back.\nAnalysts: And then you also mentioned you're not at peak transactions and I think I was measuring it earlier today around just over 400 on about 1.9 million AUV in a $12 to $13 average check. And I think, historically, there were stores that, at peak, could do that maybe in an hour, so just a quick 2-part question. Do you get more transactions by extending hours? Or do you get more transactions at peak? And I was just curious to know how does the system do at peak? What are the number of transactions currently?\nExecutives: Yes. I'll answer this and then I can have Scott chime in as well. But we believe there's more opportunity for transactions at peak, so moving people through the line faster, and that goes back to what Scott really has implemented around things where people are clear on their roles and their accountabilities in being positioned so they're ready for the throughput that they're capable of doing. So that's what we're focused on. Scott, do you want to add anything?\nExecutives: Thanks, Brian. Nicole, I think it's something that we have really only begun to put a shoulder against over the last couple of months and we still have much work to do to really move our restaurants at the pace with which we moved prior. And so there's a lot of work going on from a training perspective to ensure we're focused on the right things as it relates to shift management overall at Chipotle, something we've got to do a better job of teaching, which a key component of is faster throughput. So more on that to come, but it is a high priority for us and something we're working against as we speak.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Tarantino from Baird.\nAnalysts: Brian, my question is about your growth outlook for the next few years, and 1 thing you didn't mention is how you're thinking about unit growth over that horizon. And I guess, as you think about the opportunity to improve the economic model, what do you need to see to either accelerate the growth or continue the type of growth that you've outlined for this year? And then I have a follow-up question about the restaurant economic model. I think you mentioned that there are opportunities to drive some efficiencies to provide a tailwind to that model, so could you just elaborate on what you meant by that statement as well.\nExecutives: Sure. So your first question regarding new units and the pace of development. First of all, the new unit economics we're getting right now are, I think, best-in-class. They're still returning north of 30%, so we're very optimistic about the new stores that we're opening. I will tell you, we'll -- the pace will increase as the business continues to recover the top line sales, and I think that is something that we're going to be smart about on how we ratchet that up going forward because the good news is the returns are there. And I think as the core business really gets itself back to a place of where it was performing, we can also then, at the same time, start enhancing the new unit development. So that's going to be the approach we're going to take, David. On your second question around efficiencies and the economic model for adding additional tailwind, this is really to the point of our culture where we're going to get a little scrappier on how we approach things. And obviously, the #1 way for us to see that margin expand is through the top line sales growth, but I think there's also some opportunities for us to get scrappy as we look at business on how we're spending our money and the areas where they're being spent on. So those are really the components that we're going to be looking at to make sure that we really maximize the economic model of the business.\nAnalysts: And then just a quick follow-up; maybe it's for you or for Jack. Any way to size up the opportunity on the costs side, either at the unit level and then you also, I think, mentioned that you're cutting out a few layers in the G&A structure. Should we think about those as opportunities that flow through to the bottom line or is that sort of an area where you cut and then reinvest somewhere else? So at least any thoughts on that at this stage.\nExecutives: Yes. David, this is Jack. On the G&A, the savings are going to be reinvested. We'll have a leaner, more nimble organization. You heard Brian talked about we've got skills gaps. We've already been filling a lot of those skills gaps, so I would say it's going to be reinvestment. G&A, we think about that as being similar. Once we get through some of these onetime charges, it'll be similar to percent of sales to what we've had in the past, I would say that excluding stock comp, so it's going to be reinvestment. The reinvestment is going to really be reinvested in things that will drive our growth. In terms of the economic model and what we can do for efficiency, it's too early to tell. I think it's more of a culture and an attitude. We're going to focus on fewer things, and the fewer things will either drive growth or they will enhance the economic model. And I think by focusing on these fewer things, we're going to expect we're going to get results. But as we identify the opportunities, David, in the coming quarters, we'll share more with you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore from Bernstein.\nAnalysts: I have 1 follow-up to an earlier question and then a question on technology. The follow-up was the goal of both improving throughput and then menu innovation and maybe adding items. And I think, historically, there was some sense internally that maybe those were inconsistent. So just is the answer technology? Is it what you're talking about in terms of really defining people's roles and where they should be? Or I guess, how do we reconcile what has always been known as a very simple model where it felt like every time something was added, for example, queso, something else had to come out with what we're hearing in terms of menu innovation? And then I have another question.\nExecutives: Sure. So obviously, one of the key criteria for us as we go through the stage-gate process with any new menu item is going to be the impact on throughput, whether it improves throughput because we've added new capability with equipment or some technology advancement, meaning it moves to the second make-line, something along those lines. But one of the key criteria for anything to get to the national phase is going to be a throughput element. And what we've seen is there are some menu items that we believe have a high probability of having no impact on throughput. There are other menu items that are going to come with the requirement of probably some equipment investment and a real understanding of how do we tweak the process if we wanted to be able to maintain the same level throughput that we have today. So obviously, the second one that I just talked about is going to take a little bit longer from a testing and a validation standpoint than a menu item that has no impact on throughput or the process or equipment. So that's where the stage-gate process becomes a very important piece of the puzzle, so that we really understand the impact on our operations, the consumer and the team member and then, obviously, the financials. So we'll be leaning into that stage-gate process to ensure we find the power of throughput and innovation.\nAnalysts: Understood. And then just on the technology piece. I thought I heard you say you're going to add delivery capabilities to your app, and I think that's something that no one else yet has done in terms of the companies partnering with third party. It has been companies with in-house delivery that have been able to do that. So I mean, maybe talk about how you've leapfrogged some of what we've seen elsewhere or whether you think that is going to be a meaningful distinction between what we're seeing with other restaurants that are partnering with third-party aggregators.\nExecutives: Yes. So I'll hand it over to Curt, but let me answer your couple of questions there. Obviously, one of the things we're really excited about with delivery is our model results in food that gets delivered with great speed. And one of the things that we're really excited about in our DoorDash partnership is we saw that speed first-hand relative to all your other food alternatives on the DoorDash website. So we're very excited about the idea of being able to once you're in our app, stay in the app and get people the access opportunity to have Chipotle delivered to their home because I think people are going to be excited about the speed at which they can get Chipotle delivered to them. I don't know if we're the only ones with delivery in our app, but I'll hand it over to Curt to see if he wants to add anything.\nExecutives: Yes, I'll just -- I'll follow up by saying we're really excited, Sara, about this launch and those tests coming in later in the year. And as Brian has said, we're a learning organization now. So it's early days, and we're excited to see how customers respond and how we can continue to make digital the easiest way to Chipotle.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Glass from Morgan Stanley.\nAnalysts: My first question is just simply a time line question. Brian, when should we expect to start to see the results of some of these initiatives coming into play, specifically in the back half of this year? Is that an unreasonable expectation? Do you expect, for example, a product launch in the third quarter? And is there something on the marketing front? You talked about a lot of pieces and a lot of need to rebuild some capabilities. So what's a reasonable expectation of the type -- 2 or 3 examples of things that should happen inside of this year, let's say?\nExecutives: Yes. So what I can definitely share with you is you're going to start to see us testing programs in the back half of this year. So you'll see these tests happening in -- with some food ideas. You'll see some tests happening with digital, loyalty. And we're very excited about all those. Now depending on how things perform in that stage-gate process, we'll dictate the timetable for which we roll it out because one of the things that I think is important for the organization is we iterate, we listen, we learn before we then decide to go with a national launch. So we're in the early days of validating these propositions. And once we start moving them through the stage-gate process, we'll be sharing when they will actually be hitting the national programs going forward.\nAnalysts: Okay. So I guess, go slow to go fast, in other words, to make sure that you're getting them right when you do launch them.\nExecutives: That's correct.\nAnalysts: Okay. And then remodels was discussed last call or maybe 2 calls ago as something a 2019 effort. Maybe that was before you arrived. Do you look at the businesses needing a substantial remodel, a light remodel, or how do you view the physical assets? And how do you phase that into these other initiatives?\nExecutives: Yes. So we have an initiative called the big fix, and that is happening. I'm happy to say we're on track to be finished by the end of this year. I think we're exactly 50% of the way done right now. And this is really where we are bringing our -- all of our restaurants up to date. It's fixing the lights, the painting. It brings them back to a, I would say, a Class 1 restaurant experience. Separate from that, we also have an effort going on with a redesign, which is kind of the Chipotle restaurant of the future. And that is going to be -- you'll see that going into some testing in the back half of this year. Probably right around the fall time frame, you'll see us going into New York City.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia from William Blair.\nAnalysts: It's Sharon Zackfia, but that was a good try. I guess, a couple of questions. Now that digital is up to around 9% of sales, I'm just wondering if you've been able to harness that data at all and kind of incent to consumer behavior in different ways. I don't know where you are on that. And then if you could give us some perspective, once you launch loyalty, kind of when you'll be able to use that data to then kind of create new customer behavior. And then lastly, I don't think you mentioned international at all. So just if there's any thought on what to do with the international locations.\nExecutives: Sure. So your first question around digital and loyalty and, I guess, more importantly, the data approach to remarketing or incentivizing our customers. That's absolutely part of our approach going forward. One of the things I'm really excited about as we get this pilot going with our loyalty program, we're going to start to move to, really, the tailored data-specific marketing that then can use the currency in the rewards program to drive certain behaviors, incent certain products, incent certain experiences. And we think that's going to be a key unlock for the business going forward because as this business goes from 10% plus in digital sales, that presents an opportunity for us to have more customers in our business, engaging at a different level than they have in the past. And then when you layer on top of that a loyalty program with a strong CRM engine, I think really exciting things will be unlocked as we roll out loyalty on a national basis in 2019. Your second question was on international. For now, international is something that we are managing. It's not an aggressive part of our plan for growth. We're focusing the aggressive growth in the U.S. business, and that's why we outlined this right now.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Karen Holthouse from Goldman Sachs.\nAnalysts: Two questions that go back to some of the prepared remarks. There is a comment on opportunities to enhance the value proposition across dayparts. And then I think as it relates to value, the only specific thing mentioned was a happy hour test. Are there other things you're looking at in terms of pricing or sizing in other dayparts or is that really more of a comment on the overall customer experience potentially layering in loyalty? And then second, it would seem like some of this sort of foundational consumer research is really going to feed back into some of these tests and other strategy. How long is it until you think you get sort of the base level of data in place for that?\nExecutives: Sure. So your first question on the value and how we see that playing out. You're exactly right. We see using our rewards program as a great way to present targeted value and incentives for customers when they want it, where they want it and how they want it. Combine that with then providing some value that matches up with a daypart like the happy hour, which matches more of like a snacking occasion, I think, then we have to provide the right value equation for a snacking occasion between the hours of 3 to 5 p.m. So those are our lead-in ideas. And then, obviously, the key piece of the puzzle is always understanding our price equation as well. And what will be important is we'll continue to make sure we understand how consumers are interacting with the menu and where we see opportunities to enhance our value proposition. We will do it in a smart fashion. Your second question on the timing of the consumer foundation research. Yes, absolutely, this will inform pretty much the entire business. And we're really excited. We're going to start getting some of the preliminary results back here in the next month, and then we'll have the entire package back by the time we did the fall. So we're already starting to get some learnings back. And it's very exciting because it's new knowledge for the company, and it's new insight into our customers, which I think is going to be hugely valuable for us going forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe from JPMorgan.\nAnalysts: A couple follow-ups. Firstly, when you make delivery available on your app, what percentage of stores will that currently cover?\nExecutives: Oh, good. So are -- you're talking about the in-app delivery experience? What is that percentage, Curt?\nAnalysts: Yes, exactly.\nExecutives: John, to start, we will be covering approximately 1,500 restaurants and expect to get to around 2,000 restaurants by the end of the year.\nAnalysts: Okay, perfect. That's a big number. Secondly, Jack, I think, the question for you. I mean, you mention G&A being similar as a percentage of sales into the path, excluding executive comp. The path has actually shown some variability in terms of G&A, and obviously, executive stock comp -- executive comp is actually a big percentage of that. So as we think about '19 and '20, post the move, some of the restructurings and some of the hires, I mean, can you help us just get closer to a number in terms of what G&A should be as a percentage of sales for a company of this size? And that includes -- including stock comp.\nExecutives: Well, including the stock comp, it's tough only because when the stock moves, stock comp moves pretty dramatically as well. So the thing we can control is the underlying G&A that we spend on people, offices, things like that. I think, as we get through a lot of these nonrecurring charges, our current underlying G&A is in the, call it, low 5% to mid-5% range. When you add in stock comp, you're in the mid- to high 6s or something like that. I think that, as we get through, all of these adjustments with our offices and our structure will still be in that same kind of range. Now once we get to that range, as we build sales with the strategies that you've heard today, we've been able to lever G&A in the past, and I expect we'll be able to lever G&A in the future. I think the important thing is that our G&A will be in a similar pattern. What's really going to drive is we're going to drive top line sales that will drive our margins, that will drive unit economics. And that's where I think most of our shareholder value is going to come from.\nAnalysts: And then 2 quick ones. Brian, to your previous experience and especially on the operating side, how do you think about the right prime cost, food and paper plus labor for Chipotle? I mean, that's a line that's actually changed quite a lot over the course of the history of this company, but do you think about it at the 60% range? Do you think about it at 55%, somewhere in between? I mean, is there is something that you think about on the prime cost side in terms of what this business should be over the course of the cycle?\nExecutives: Yes, John, this is Jack. Right now, we're in kind of the 60% range. Our model works quite well. We're in the 60% range, but you know very well that it wasn't that long ago we were in the 55% range. And that's how you get margins in the mid- to high 20% range. We have the ability to get back to that, but it all depends on the top line. And so the strategies that you've heard today are very heavily weighted towards driving the top line, bringing customers in, making the brand relevant again. If we do all that well, we have the ability to get those prime costs back into some of our historical ranges.\nAnalysts: And that's a very important point. And then finally, when you mentioned $10 billion of your sales for the Chipotle U.S. brand, how many stores does that contemplate in your current thinking in terms of optimizing that portfolio?\nExecutives: Yes. Look, the way we think about it is you could easily be around 5,000 stores at some point while we're exceeding $10 billion.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays.\nAnalysts: Two questions. First, just Brian, I know you talked about being pleased with the underlying sales trends. Just wondering from our side of the seat, and the compares are obviously difficult to read, though, on the 2 year. Just wondering, what measures do you focus on perhaps daily or weekly or monthly, whether it's variability by geography or daypart or product line? We're just trying to figure out how you define success in your seat in terms of the comp growth. And then I had a follow-up on the supply chain.\nExecutives: Sure. So look, we are watching sales and transactions every day, and we look at it by region and by daypart. And what we continue to see is good performance in all the dayparts. And we're optimistic that the continued improvement in throughput and operational execution will continue to support the sales trends that we've seen to date. And then obviously, going forward, the plan is to accelerate the sales and transactions with the initiatives that we put through the stage-gate process that then we have a high level of confidence that we'll grow the business. So that's what we're looking at. That's the scorecard we keep an eye on, on a daily basis. The other key thing we also look at is obviously what percent of our business is growing through the [ second and eight month ] because this is an indicator of how we're doing on driving our digital and off-premise business.\nAnalysts: Got you. And just separately on the supply chain side of things. I mean, there was mention of Food with Integrity and that you talked about authenticity and transparency, which sounds like conference calls from years past. Just wondering, how much time have you spent focused on the supply chain? Maybe what changes do you think need to come? Obviously, there's big risk in the supply chain, and as you enhance kind of new products and whatnot, I'm just wondering your thoughts on the supply[-side ] changes that have been put in place and what we should expect going forward.\nExecutives: Yes, sure. So a couple of things. One, I think I mentioned this in my prepared remarks. Maybe I didn't. But we've hired a new supply chain leader. And it's probably the first time in a long time that we've had, what I would call, a real expert in the supply chain space leading our supply chain efforts. He's 2, maybe 3 weeks into the job now. Very excited about him getting into the role and helping us figure out our next chapter on how we work with our suppliers and partners on our supply chain. And then to answer your question, my ability to get out and meet some folks. I've had the opportunity to meet with our 2 of our bigger partners, OSI and Miniat. And the thing that I love about our partnerships is they're as equally excited about the food as we are. And to have that commitment to that quality is usually valuable. And then obviously, we'll figure out how we view it in the most efficient fashion. But when you have that shared value of commitment to quality and excellence and Food with Integrity and really trying to move things to another level, it makes for a powerful partnership. So I'm very excited about Carlos joining the work, and I'm very excited about my early conversations with some of our key suppliers.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Charles from Cowen and Co.\nAnalysts: It's actually Brian Vieten on for Andrew. And if I could just ask maybe 2 around digital. So in terms of the app, as we look out kind of the adoption curve, what do you guys view as sort of the biggest hurdles to break into the fray in sort of offering consumers a compelling reason to download the app? The confidence is always -- is encouraging, but thus far, we've kind of seen this as a challenge, not only for fast-casual, but sort of the broader restaurant industry. And then in your answer to Sara, I believe, it sounded like maybe once customers download the app, delivery can drive sort of deeper engagement with the app. But what are the bigger hurdles you see to breaking through the fray and driving that adoption on an in-house app? And just secondly, from a marketing perspective, in the spirit of moving away from promotions and more towards a centralized approach, from a delivery or mobile app perspective, does that mean marketing will center more so on media ads? Or could that have more of a promotional element?\nExecutives: Sure. So look, I think our biggest hurdle on the app, frankly, is just awareness. Right now, I think, I was just looking at some numbers, but more than 50%, I think it's like 52% of people aren't even aware that we have an app. And I think this goes back to the question somebody asked me earlier, why do you believe the brand isn't as visible as it should be? It's things like this that are, I think, key growth engines for the business that we just have really low awareness on. So job #1 is to get people aware of the app because I think they're going to love the experience, based on the users that are already in the app. And then job 2 is how do you get them to continue to use it. Well, I think we have a key -- continue to provide utility in that app, adding things like delivery, adding a loyalty program. These are things that will continue to provide utility for them because then what we'll be able to do is get into this game of one-to-one communication and really change the level of engagement with our customer through that app experience. So it's going to be a combination of things that, I think, ultimately move the app forward. But I think the biggest challenge for us first and foremost is making people aware that they have the app. Then you don't need experience that gives them a reason to keep using it, right? So the whole experience then is just superior to anything else they've seen where when they order, they pick it up, the order is accurate, the speed is like nothing they've seen. If it's getting delivered, it's at a level of speed that they haven't seen, with accuracy that they haven't seen and then, obviously, layer in the idea of loyalty. I think you start building utility for why people are going to adopt the usage over time. What was your second question?\nAnalysts: Great. Yes, just secondly, just from a marketing perspective, I know you guys have talked about sort of moving away from promotions and sort of more towards a centralized marketing approach. But just from a delivery or mobile app adoption perspective, just wondering, does that mean the marketing to get those sign-ups will center more so on sort of media ads? Or could that have more of a promotional element of maybe a coupon or something to that effect?\nExecutives: Look, what we're going to be moving towards is programs that, I think, are going to engage and connect at a different level than we have in the past. And how we choose to connect will be driven by the users that we're trying to persuade with the experience that we provide. So you're going to see us be very present in digital, mobile, all the nontraditional mediums. And you're also going to see us show up in the traditional mediums because, I think, at the end of the day, and Chris, feel free to chime in here, we want to be relevant and engaged with all category users like medium and heavy. And to do that, that means our marketing program has to be comprehensive and find people at the right times when they're interested in engaging with Chipotle. Chris, I don't know if you want to add anything.\nExecutives: Yes. I think, look, we'll -- you got to use all the tools at your disposal. And there will certainly be some promotional things. We'll continue some of the promotional things that we've done in the past. But overall, you'll see a pullback in promotional activity in favor of the more centralized marketing and driving awareness and, hopefully, transactions and traffic that will follow that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Matt McGinley from Evercore ISI.\nAnalysts: On the unit growth and the CapEx, and Brian, I appreciate that the economic model of the restaurant and the top line is what supports future unit growth. But the development pipeline for units is not a short one, typically. And this year, you guys had slowed the unit growth, but you ramped up the investment in existing stores, remodels and just investment in digital and things like that. But it doesn't sound like you want to put out a specific growth number or you would have done so. But does the present new unit run rate seem like that's the right pace of growth? Or -- and then I guess, secondly, is the investment that you made in CapEx in those new stores, is that unique to 2018, or is it something that we should expect more spending on, on existing units in the future?\nExecutives: Yes. Look, I think when we get to the fall, we'll be in a better position to talk through exactly how we're seeing the new unit growth. But I think, like we said in the last earnings call, we see at or better in 2019. And to your point, the development pipeline is an 18-month pipeline. So what is good news is we're seeing great economic results in the new restaurants we're opening, and we're liking the economic model that we have in our current restaurants as we continue to see additional sales strength. And then your question on the CapEx as it was allocated in the big fix. The big fix is just that, it's a big fix, where we're coming in to probably make up for some time that we should have been doing it over time that we didn't. And so as a result, we are coming in and doing it. But I do think, going forward, one of the things that's going to be important is we don't find ourselves falling behind on our restaurants. That's something we don't want to repeat, but we'll be able to share more details on that front probably around the fall.\nAnalysts: And on the store closures, other than being unprofitable, is there a common theme on the age of the store, the location or the geography that -- amongst these 60 or so that you're going to wind up closing?\nExecutives: Not really. There's no common theme. I don't -- Jack, I don't know if you want to add anything to that.\nExecutives: Yes. No, they're all over the place. They're of various ages. Some are a couple years old. Some are 15 years old. We literally just culled the list, found all the restaurants that were cash flow bleeders, went through to look at every single site, looked at quality of the real estate, quality of the team, the sales trend, and we made a decision. And frankly, we don't close stores very often, so we didn't like closing these, but these are ones that we just didn't see getting to or above breakeven for some period of time. But they were all over the place. There's nothing that's broken with our approach to our real estate pipeline. These just were random misses.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bittner from Oppenheimer and Company.\nAnalysts: But do you plan, at any point, to give us a more detailed look into how you expect all of this to impact the financials, whether that be through the establishment of financial targets or goals or for something else? And then I have a follow-up.\nExecutives: The -- so look, we have not changed any of our expectations for the year. And then, I think, as we get through the stage-gate process for these various initiatives, we'll have a high level of confidence with what that performance looks like, which then obviously, as these things unfold, we will share with you the progress that we're making in the business. The point of today's conversation was to share with you the strategy for how we see the growth unfolding. And as we start to validate that growth, we will share with you how that's impacting all the financial targets and the subsequent pieces of the puzzle that come with it.\nAnalysts: Okay. And just as you set out to drive this top line strategy, I mean, should we expect all the incremental sales growth from this strategy to be highly incremental to profits and margins and just drive significant operating leverage? Or are we -- should we be expecting some type of in-store operating expense step-up to drive this strategy or capital expense step-up or whatnot just on the investment side?\nExecutives: Look, what we're looking for, obviously, is incremental profitable growth, right? That's what we are first and foremost after. With that said, various initiatives are going to have varying degrees of incrementality. And what I'm excited about is -- the preliminary look is we've got a lot of exciting things that we're going to start putting through our stage-gate process that it's going to start validating how incremental these programs are and then how that flows through the economic model. So -- but yes, of course, the goal is incremental, profitable sales growth. That's why we're vetting these ideas.\nAnalysts: Understood. And just final question for me. Just, Brian, can you comment on moving the headquarters from Denver to Southern California? What are the primary benefits you expect to harness from this move?\nExecutives: Sure. I think, as we mentioned in here, we're going to be building more marketing, more digital, more menu, data analytics, varying areas of expertise. And we think we have the ability to really transform the organization in a faster fashion by relocating the company. So that's the [ precipitous ] for doing it. And there's lots of talent on the West Coast and across the entire country that, frankly, wants to be a part of the Chipotle journey. So we're very excited about the restructuring, the relocation and the new culture and talent that we'll be building.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris O'Cull from Stifel.\nAnalysts: It's actually Mitch on for Chris. A question about catering and the opportunity around that. You recently announced options for smaller groups in different pricing tiers. Curious, are you pleased with those effects of those actions? And are you employing other initiatives to grow that business, perhaps putting more marketing dollars behind it?\nExecutives: Go ahead, Chris.\nExecutives: We view catering as a big opportunity and highly incremental opportunity. I think that they -- drilling down to a package size and a price point that's a little bit more accessible should open up that market even further and give us some more flexibility. It certainly is on our radar screen from a digital ordering standpoint. So we're just racking and stacking that with all of the other mobile and digital and delivery initiatives that we have. We will be putting dedicated resources against it going forward because we do think it's a good opportunity. So we think that in -- with the rest of the suite, mobile and digital ordering and delivery and everything, that catering is a key aspect for us. And we'll see how this new rollout of this smaller one goes. And we'll pour the gas to the tanks that deliver the most incremental profit for us. And we'll continue to evaluate others to help optimize those. So we love catering. We think it will be awesome. We think it's a huge opportunity, and we'll just take and sequence it with everything else.\nAnalysts: Okay. And then just a follow-up question on loyalty. I'm curious whether you have done any studies to gauge consumer demand for this. And if so, what have they showed?\nExecutives: Yes, we have. And actually, this is one of the top consumer requests for Chipotle to provide. It's a -- this is going to be one that's going to be a customer pleaser.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Gregory Francfort from Bank of America.\nAnalysts: I got 2 questions. The first is, just after you do the tax write-off, I think part of the reason the tax rate was staying high the next couple of years is because the stock was down. What -- if you sort of write that off, what do you think this ongoing tax rate's going to be? And then more from a bigger picture, Brian, how do you envision the operational flow of the line? And as you go out and test in these new store prototypes, are you going to be putting in new equipment for new products? And if so, where do you think that goes? And just any changes to the structure of flow of the line as you see it today or opportunities to kind of change that to improve the labor efficiency or anything along that line.\nExecutives: Well, why don't I answer the second question, and I'll hand it over to Jack on the tax. So to answer your question, any new item that we bring in, one of the things that I'm very cognizant of is today, the reason why we have $2 million AUVs is because we're selling burritos, bowls and tacos at a tremendous throughput. And that model has to be protected. So as I mentioned earlier, one of the key criteria is anything we bring in cannot cause us to go backwards from a throughput standpoint, okay? Now with that said, there's going to be products that we may introduce new equipment that, I think, will improve the experience for the customer when they order something that maybe doesn't go down the line the way it always has. We may have to put a piece of equipment in a different place so that you move from a customer-facing line where things are flowing to where it moves off, uses a piece of equipment but then gets back to that register and expediter in the right timing so that the flow is uninterrupted. And you see this happen in a lot of other restaurants. The key is, though, you have to take the time to make sure you understand the time and motion involved with the new equipment and the new menu item. And so we're going to take that time. We're not going to rush it when you got something that is going to be a difference to the current line optimization that we have today. And the initiative that utilizes the current line optimization probably will be able to move through the stage-gate process a lot faster. So yes, that is going to be the approach. But I just want to clarify. I mean, one of the things that is -- and I think I've said this in my remarks. One of the things that is exciting for me that I discovered is just better understanding how powerful this operating model is. The economics and the food and the team member experience that all happens with this line is a real gem, and we have to protect it. And fortunately, one of the other gems we have is that second make-line, which allows us then to do a lot of this digital business, off-premise business, without impacting that customer-facing line at all. If anything, it creates a lot more capacity in the restaurant, and it creates an even more attractive economic model when you start ramping up on that digital make-line, or second make-line. So I'm really excited about how we can use technology, loyalty, access and some menu innovation to really, I think, drive incremental growth that helps us protect our throughput and, hopefully, improve on it. Jack, I don't know if you want to get the tax.\nExecutives: Yes, Greg. Chris was volunteering, but I'll take it, Chris. Yes, Greg, our underlying tax rate is 28.8%, and I went through that in quite a bit of detail on the first quarter call. So you might want to go back to the transcript on that. Our rate is going to be higher, in the high 30s. It was in high 30s the first quarter. It will be about that rate in the fourth quarter. These are related to -- they're not economic. They're not cash. The thing I mentioned today about a $10 million write-off, these are deferred tax assets that were put on the books when our stock was at a much higher level. We're expecting with the restructuring that stock options are going to be -- they're going to be forfeited. They're vested, they're going to be forfeited as we restructure. So there's no tax deduction available. But there's also no expense available either. Those options are not going to be exercised at all. It's just an imperfection in the way accounting leaves the expense on the books. Tax will never allow a deduction when there is not an actual cost involved and so -- but these are noneconomic. They don't take out any cash out of our balance sheet. And they're very difficult to predict. In a normal environment where the stock continues to increase, you won't see this type of stuff. As we see this stuff coming, I'll warn you about it, and we'll tell you about it each quarter, about these unusual write-off of deferred tax assets.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Peter Saleh from BTIG.\nAnalysts: Brian, I think you touched on this in your last comment. But can you talk about the margin profile or maybe the throughput capability of that digitally enhanced second make-line?\nExecutives: Well, I probably won't get into the specifics of the margin associated with it. But what I can tell you is it obviously runs with less labor. It's in the 3 people needed in order to execute the second make-line versus 6 or 7 people on the customer-facing line at peak. So that obviously is a nice tailwind for the second make-line. And then the other piece that we love about it is the accuracy and the speed associated with using that second make-line is also another really powerful tool because now, with our second make-line, we can literally tell everybody, \"You can skip the line when you order online.\" And that's going to be, I think, a powerful message in the Chipotle business going forward.\nAnalysts: And then just my last question. On the loyalty program, are you envisioning this to be a digital-only loyalty program? Or will this be something similar to what you had in the past with like a physical presence in the store?\nExecutives: I'm going to let Curt answer that one. He's the master of all things loyalty.\nExecutives: Peter, the loyalty program will be available in restaurant as well as online, but there will not be a physical card. So a customer will create an account, a loyalty account, digitally, and they can use their phone to present that account either on the register or, as Brian has said, the fastest way to order is to order digitally where that number will just be placed as part of that ordering process.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nick Setyan from Wedbush.\nAnalysts: Just on pricing, as mid-single-digit labor inflation is ongoing, and food costs may not remain as benign as they've been this year. How are you thinking about your pricing strategy going forward? And then just specifically, how are you thinking about pricing in 2019?\nExecutives: Yes, so we've not made any decisions on our pricing for 2019. But our approach to pricing will be, obviously, looking at the metrics you just talked about, and then you obviously have to put the customer into that equation as well. So that's the approach we're going to be taking: understanding what's going on with our food cost and paper cost, combined with our labor cost and then managing that relative to what our customers' expectation is on a great value proposition and then also how much growth we foresee the business to also overcome some of the inflation. So we're going to take a comprehensive view, and we will approach it that way every year.\nAnalysts: And I guess, just a follow-up maybe for Jack. As we kind of think about transaction growth, assuming there's no pricing in 2019, what kind of transaction growth do you think is necessary for us to be able to lever at the unit level?\nExecutives: Yes. I mean, if you have -- it depends on the inflation. But if you have inflation of like labor inflation, for example, of somewhere in the mid-single digits, which is what we've been running, you need to get like a mid-single-digit, transaction-driven comp just to stay even on the restaurant cash flow line. You'll still -- you'll delever on labor, but you'll make it up in some of the other line items, and you'll about break even. So I think, in this kind of environment, you have to be considering a combination of transaction growth and a well-thought-out, as Brian mentioned, price increase to try to offset both so that as you're growing transactions, you'll at least hold at macro margins.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jon Tower from Wells Fargo.\nAnalysts: I know it's getting late, so I'll try to be quick with these. Just first one for Jack. If you can quantify what the drag was or will be from those 55 to 65 stores that you're planning on closing, what sort of drag that was on store-level margins. Second, I guess, this is for Brian or Chris. In terms of making the brand more visible over time, is that going to require a higher spend going forward from a marketing standpoint? I think that's run roughly about 3% of sales, historically. And then lastly, now that you're doing all this brand research in the early learnings, have you better determined where some of that lost traffic has gone since the food crisis, meaning other fast-casual brands or fast food? That's it.\nExecutives: Yes, I guess, we'll take in order. This is Jack. In the restaurant-level margin, those restaurants were well under $1 million. They were all cash flow losers. When they're all fully closed, we should expect a margin improvement of 30 basis points or more. Now keep in mind, we're closing about half or so in the first month, and then the others will be -- happen over time as we negotiate with the leases. So this won't be -- this won't hit all at one time, but eventually, when they're all closed, we should pick up 30 basis points or perhaps a little more.\nExecutives: Yes, it's Chris. I'll take the conversation about the overall marketing budget. I think that, you're right, we have about a 3% marketing budget. I think our opportunity, certainly in the short term, is to be more efficient and effective with the existing dollars that we have. But one of the beauties of having an innovation pipeline in the stage-gate process and a testing protocol is that you can test varying levels and so you have a much better certainty about what you're doing and as you go national once you've tested it in a test market. So we'll simulate different levels of spending, and then we can decide as we go forward whether those delivered on what we wanted to or not. And so over time, you might be able to lean into some products, and some products, you may not. So I think that's part of the beauty of having a defined process and an innovation process and an innovation pipeline, so that you can pick and choose what works the best. In terms of the question about where they went and who we source from, I think that's a big part of the foundation of research. I think one of the beauties of Chipotle, though, is that we have a great balance of getting consumers not only from just QSR and other fast-casual but even from casual dine, and also, we have a great mix of both men and women. So it's a really widely appealing brand, and I think that's a big opportunity for us to appeal to category users from a more centralized marketing standpoint than just a more decentralized promotional base marketing plan that we've had in the past.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I now would like to turn the call back to management for closing remarks.\nExecutives: All right. Well, thank you, everybody. And hopefully, you have clarity on our strategy for how we're going to cultivate a better world and win today. And thank you for everybody's time and your interest in Chipotle. Have a good night.\nOperator: This concludes tonight's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.\nOperator: Greetings, and welcome to Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. Special Investor Call. [Operator Instructions] Today's presentation contains 2 videos. Audio during these videos will only be heard over the webcast and not over the telephone. Those listening via the phone will only experience silence during this time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. \nI would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Coralie Witter from Chipotle.\nExecutives: Hello, everyone, and welcome to our call today. Before we begin our presentation, I will remind everyone that parts of our discussion today will include forward-looking statements as defined in the securities laws. These forward-looking statements will include statements regarding our strategy and initiatives to build sales and the expected sales opportunity represented by digital channels, statements about our unit economics, information relating to the anticipated restaurant closures, information relating to anticipated onetime costs and restructuring charges and statements regarding our future sales potential as well as other statements of our expectations and plans. These statements are based on information available to us today and we are not assuming any obligation to update them. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. We refer you to the risk factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K as updated in our subsequent Form 10-Qs for a discussion of these risks. \nI'd also like to remind everyone that we will not be providing any updates to our Q2 results to date or to our guidance. We have adopted a self-imposed quiet period that is in place following this call, restricting communications with investors until our Q2 earnings release scheduled for July 26. We will start today's call with some prepared remarks from Brian Niccol, Chief Executive Officer; Marissa Andrada, Chief HR Officer; Chris Brandt, Chief Marketing Officer; and Jack Hartung, Chief Financial Officer. We will allow plenty of time at the end of those remarks for questions. In the room and also available during the Q&A period are Scott Boatwright, Chief Restaurant Officer; Curt Garner, Chief Digital and Information Officer; and Laurie Schalow, Chief Communications Officer. \nBefore I turn the call over to Brian, I want to mention that the slides that will be shown during the webcast are also available on our website at chipotle.com in the Investor Relations section. And as a usability note, if you are accessing the webcast via a Chrome browser, you will need to hit the Play button when the slides appear on the webcast as the videos will not autoload. \nWith that, I'll turn it over to Brian.\nExecutives: Thanks, Coralie, and thanks to all of you joining us this afternoon and for your interest in Chipotle. As Coralie mentioned, we will not be talking about Q2 results today. Instead, we'll focus on our near-term and long-term strategy. But I will tell you that we are pleased with the underlying sales trends we are seeing as the sales trends from Q1 have continued into Q2. We're confident that the strategy we'll talk about today can accelerate our future growth. Our vision at Chipotle is to win today and cultivate a better future, and we will achieve that vision with a clear strategy, strong supporting structure and a new culture. \nSpecifically, today, we will talk about 5 focus areas that will drive sales and transactions as part of our growth turnaround: #1, becoming a more culturally relevant, engaging brand that builds love and loyalty; #2, digitizing and modernizing our restaurant experience that creates a more convenient and enjoyable guest experience; #3, running great restaurants with great hospitality and throughput; #4, being disciplined and focused to enhance our powerful economic model; and #5, building a great culture that can innovate and execute across digital, access, menu and the restaurant experience.\nBefore we dive deeper into those 5 focus areas, let me first share with you what I've learned about Chipotle since joining 3 months ago, a state of the union, if you will. First, I found a number of positives. As I mentioned in April, I've seen that consumers really love our brand. We can build on that and continue to create more distance between us and others. We don't believe anyone else has the quality of ingredients that drives great taste like we have, and now our marketing will lean into that to increase awareness and remind customers why they fell in love with Chipotle. \nWe also have an excellent value proposition that we can enhance across all dayparts and our new restaurant economics today are very strong. We have built a solid foundation and made progress in digital that we expect to accelerate in the coming months. Our second make-line is a significant competitive advantage that enables throughput and efficiency that enhances our economic model going forward. And finally, I'm very proud of the passionate people we have working in or supporting our roughly 2,500 restaurants that are responding enthusiastically to our new strategy. \nHowever, I also found that we have some gaps that we are actively addressing. There is a lack of discipline around priorities, process and accountability, and we were not sufficiently results focused, which made us reactive and hampered execution. I found skills gaps in many areas and insufficient data for decision making that have held us back from reaching our potential. There is no validated menu innovation pipeline, a general lack of customer understanding and no real process for scaling and commercializing innovation. \nAnd as you've heard me say before, the brand had been silent and lost some of its cultural relevance. I found that our marketing dollars had been inefficiently allocated, and we are working quickly to correct that. And lastly, in our restaurants, our throughput remains below potential, and we need to move consumers through the line more quickly and deploy technology to help us do that. \nI'm happy to report that all of this is changing. Organizationally, we are adding experienced, professional talent in many areas, including marketing, menu, digital, analytics and human resources. Our leaders will provide clear direction and roles will have defined accountabilities. We will invest in areas core to our strategy and be scrappy in looking for efficiency opportunities to fund our investments. \nFor example, we have flattened the organization with the removal of layers which, when combined with clear roles and responsibilities, will speed up decision making and drive better results. We are putting in place a clear governance structure for the organization to enable efficient execution. Importantly, we will build muscle around innovation by establishing a stage-gate process where we test, learn and iterate, so that when we roll out a new initiative, we are highly confident in the probabilities of success. Overall, we will transform into a learning organization that is decisive and one that constantly iterates to achieve our core objectives. \nTo give you a concrete example of what I'm talking about, I'd like to tell you about our new digital pickup shelves, which you can see on your screen. While the app experience that was rolled out late last year is best-in-class, in many of our restaurants, it is unclear to our customers where to pick up that order, which detracts from the experience. In our downtown Denver restaurant, we cut a window into our wall near the kitchen door not far from the register and put a digital pickup sign above it. That simple change caused a double-digit increase in our digital sales within the first few weeks, and it sustained. \nNot only did it provide a significantly faster and more convenient mobile order and pickup experience, but it served as in-store marketing that raised awareness among our customers standing in line. There's a big opportunity across all of our restaurants because over half of our customers aren't even aware that you can order ahead for pickup at Chipotle. We looked into adding windows in all restaurants, but quickly realized that with permitting and other issues, it'd just take too long to roll out. So we hypothesized that we could get the same benefit with self-serve shelves and a sign overhead and get them rolled out much faster and more cost effective. \nWe had digital pickup shelf prototypes in a handful of restaurants as we speak and expect to expand into another test market this summer. These shelves unlock the power of our second make-line and accelerate our digital sales flywheel to drive more mobile and delivery orders and more group orders, in addition to increasing peak capacity in our restaurants by providing a relief valve for our very busy customer-facing service line.\nThis is just 1 great example. What else is changing at Chipotle? We will make the brand more engaging, more visible and more culturally relevant. In our restaurants, we will provide a great experience with great hospitality, food cooked to perfection with convenience enhancing fast throughput. Importantly, we will lean into the strengths we have, namely our 70,000 employees that are passionate, committed and working hard to make Chipotle better; our great-tasting classically cooked food made from real ingredients; our strong value proposition; our brand equity and our efficient and effective digitized second make-line.\nWe have a lot of work to do to win today and cultivate a better future. While I could not be more excited about the future of Chipotle, it's important to be patient and recognize that people and process changes don't happen overnight. We need to add talent, build and create muscle memory around processes and testing capabilities, and upgrade our enabling tools and technology. While we're doing that, we're focusing on the singles and doubles that can create short-term sales and transaction momentum, while we build capabilities behind larger opportunities. \nLooking at our team, we are fortunate that Curt Garner started building improved digital capabilities when he joined 2 years ago, and we are now enjoying some of the fruits of those efforts with digital sales at just under 9% in the first quarter. We have the ability to lean more heavily into our digital initiatives to drive further growth, as I'll describe later.\nWe are also fortunate that Scott Boatwright began restructuring the field organization last fall and is completing the final stages of this process. Additionally, we're investing in training to consistently deliver an outstanding guest experience, investing in our facilities to improve the appearance of our restaurants and in modernizing the tools our restaurants need to enable faster throughput, better efficiency and a better team experience in our restaurants. \nI'll turn it over to Marissa, our new Chief Human Resource Officer.\nExecutives: Thanks, Brian. I am personally delighted to be part of Chipotle and to support our over 70,000 employees. It's great to be here today with you on the call. \nWe're excited about this unique opportunity to build a dynamic culture and lead Chipotle on its next and what we truly believe will be its most rewarding chapter. It's no secret that we're successful because of our people. We will deliver our strategy through a people and culture transformation. We will modernize the structure, build organizational capability, elevate our talent and leverage technology to provide our restaurants with world-class service levels from our support centers in Newport Beach and Columbus.\nWe are starting the creation of an organizational structure that we believe will allow us to best execute our strategy. As announced, this includes a reorganization where we will leverage technology to improve processes and align our work within our Newport Beach and Columbus support centers with a structure that will provide world-class service levels to our restaurants, and we'll streamline our structure to eliminate 2 layers to stay nimble and agile as we grow, allowing us to reinvest in new capabilities and skills. It's our firm belief that the way to grow a company and to bring around a life is to grow its people. \nWe're building and bringing in new capabilities across the organization, including in marketing, menu, digital, analytics and human resources. Key aspects of our strategy are attracting, developing and inspiring best-in-class talent and cultivating an environment that inspires mutual learning and development. We will grow Chipotle by growing people. As part of our cultural DNA, we will codify our values to inspire curiosity, creativity and innovation. Our employee experience will be the foundation for our customer experience. As a team, we will be committed to driving accountability for performance in people at Chipotle, as this is critical to cultivating a better world. \nToday, our employees join and love working at Chipotle because they love our real food. In the future, we will create an environment where employees will join Chipotle because they love our real food and that they belong in a company that unleashes their potential. I can't wait to embark upon the journey together. \nNow I'll turn it back to Brian.\nExecutives: Thanks, Marissa. We are happy to have you on the team. I'll take a moment to elaborate on the priorities that will be visible to our guests: running great restaurants, modernizing and digitizing our restaurants and becoming a more relevant and engaging brand. \nI've already discussed the roadmap that Scott Boatwright is executing to run our great restaurants. When we talk about modernizing and digitizing our restaurant, it means making it easier to access Chipotle. We want our guests to enjoy Chipotle whatever way is most convenient for them, whether it be through ordering and paying digitally ahead of time, through delivery or via group ordering options. \nOur digital sales are fast approaching $0.5 billion with very little marketing support. We believe that by increasing awareness of our mobile order-ahead feature and improving the in-store experience, we can accelerate the rate of digital sales growth, and our digitized second make-line has the capacity to handle significant increases in volume. Over time, we think this can be a multibillion-dollar opportunity. \nI mentioned earlier the digital pickup shelves that we are testing can help unlock the potential of our digitized second make-line. For those of you that are new to Chipotle, our second make-line is a second production line in the back of our restaurant that looks and functions just like our front service line. We are now in the process of digitizing those second make-lines, as you can see on your screen. \nWhat that means is that instead of reading small font on paper receipts to assemble our orders, our crew now has 2 flat screens above the line with pictures that mirror the placement of the food on the line and lights up just the bins required to assemble an order. This results in much better throughput, greater capacity to build digital sales and even more importantly for our customers, much better accuracy.\nDelivery is a significant opportunity for us that also leverages the production capacity of our second make-line. In April, we added DoorDash as a new partner and we continue to expand a number of restaurants that all of our partners can deliver from. Our delivery business previously has been built with virtually no marketing. We learned this quarter, through joint efforts with both DoorDash and Postmates, that we can accelerate delivery growth simply through greater awareness and best-in-class delivery times. Later this summer, we will add delivery capabilities to our app so that the fastest way to deliver Chipotle to your chair is only a few clicks away. We will also continue to increase access by making group occasions more convenient for small and large groups alike. \nNow let's talk more about our great Chipotle brand. Being a relevant brand starts with insightful consumer understanding. We are investing in foundational customer research right now and this will help us refine our innovation strategies around marketing, digital, access, menu and restaurants. We'll have conclusions from that research this fall, but some of the early qualitative findings are encouraging, namely that our commitment to Food with Integrity is a key point of difference and our customers feel good about our delicious food. \nWe will build on the customer understanding that we are gaining with CRM capabilities and we will test the loyalty program that leverages those insights in the second half of this year, leading to a planned national launch in 2019. Our loyalty program will give us a currency with which to incent and reward trial and new behaviors. \nWe are also increasing our brand relevance by adding new occasions which our loyalty currency can support. The good news is that we had no value issue with our burritos, bowls and tacos. We can build on that strength and get people excited about snacking dayparts. For example, we are exploring a happy hour offering that enhances our value proposition during nonpeak snacking hours, with $2 tacos with a drink between 2 p.m. and 5 p.m. We're also exploring a similar offer for increased late-night sales after 8 p.m. \nAnother way to be more relevant to our consumers is with excitement around our menu. We think about menu innovation in 4 key ways: #1, what our customers tell us they want, like nachos and quesadillas we're experimenting with in a test kitchen; #2, items our customers tell us they want us to bring back like chorizo; #3, new items that can be unique to Chipotle like the frozen Mexican chocolate milkshake and the avocado tostada that are also in the test kitchen; and finally, #4, celebrating existing items that are already in our restaurants. \nFor example, many people don't know we have sofritas or what sofritas is. It's a great-tasting organic tofu cooked with our adobo blend for a delicious vegetarian choice. The goal is to thoughtfully add delicious menu items that drive incrementality, are operationally easy to execute and enhance our ability to drive great throughput. We need to build capabilities in this area and build a pipeline utilizing a stage-gate process. You'll begin to see more tests in the second half of this year and you can expect relevant menu news in the coming quarters.\nFinally, we are changing the cultural narrative around our brand. We know we can drive growth by putting more effective and relevant marketing behind our innovative initiatives and by reminding people why they love Chipotle. Being culturally relevant means being present in sports, fashion, technology and entertainment. \nI'll turn it over to Chris Brandt, our new Chief Marketing Officer, to elaborate on how he is positioning Chipotle to be more engaging and more culturally relevant.\nExecutives: Thanks, Brian. Before I talk about some of the early progress we've made, I just want to say I'm thrilled to be a part of Chipotle. It's early days for me, but I've never seen a brand that has more purpose and more passion than Chipotle. Cultivate a Better World isn't just a slogan on a wall; it lives in the hearts of our employees and their pride in serving people responsibly sourced, classically cooked, delicious food you feel good about eating. Many consumers feel that same passion as well. There is such a unique emotional component to this brand stemming from its authenticity and transparency about food that we need to reinforce and reignite. \nTo that end, our ultimate marketing mission is to make Chipotle not just a food brand but a purpose-driven lifestyle brand. What do I mean by that? Chipotle will become a brand that people want to know about, want to be a part of and want to wear as a badge. I genuinely believe that Chipotle can transcend the food category, separate itself from everyone else and be a category of one because there are no compromises with Chipotle. No one has such great-tasting food that you feel good about eating like we do.\nTo accomplish that mission of making Chipotle a lifestyle brand, we need to change our approach and evolve our marketing philosophy and our tactics. We need to strike a balance of traffic driving, short-term wins and long-term growth that we call winning today and cultivating a better future. We need to celebrate our food and ingredients and expand our reach with consumers. We need to be culturally relevant and a part of the conversation. We need to show people we can have some fun because when a brand has a purpose, is visible and is doing fun things that are part of culture, people are more interested in it and want to be a part of it. That's how you become a lifestyle brand. \nWe've already taken some steps in that direction. Our latest advertising campaign was put together in my first couple of weeks and was a noticeable pivot from prior work. We celebrated the food, showed how crave-able it is and we also demonstrated a little bit of our personality and sense of humor. Let's watch.\n[Presentation]\nExecutives: The data we had from third-parties result in anecdotal evidence that shows these ads were very well received by consumers. Not only did we change our creative direction in a matter of weeks, we also changed the media plan to feature broader reach in popular programs. We advertise in signature, culturally relevant programs like the NBA playoffs and season finales of top shows across a variety of networks. We also linked to sponsorship with a top gaming team playing Fortnite, easily the hottest video game right now that has taken the nation by storm. These actions not only got us heightened awareness with consumers, but our team members also saw them. One of my favorite quotes was from a team member who saw the ads on TV and said, \"I love them. It feels like we are back on the front foot again. That's awesome.\" \nBut there is much, much more to come. We are shifting our marketing from a field-based, promotion-driven approach to a centralized strategy featuring broader reach with category users. Our goal is to make our marketing dollars more efficient and effective and most importantly, help drive traffic. The foundational consumer research Brian mentioned will give us better insight in consumers. We're putting a stage-gate process in place with dedicated resources to help validate new product and promotional ideas. We're working with our agency partners to develop innovative creative that is focused on celebrating Food with Integrity and the real ingredients that make Chipotle great. \nWe're rolling out a new tagline this fall that's a perfect fit for the brand. We're developing innovative media plans with key partners to reach consumers in unique ways across both traditional and digital channels. We're going to expand the awareness of mobile ordering and delivery or, as we call it, the easiest way to Chipotle. We're going to be more engaging in social media. Already, 2 of our recent Instagram posts are the most liked in Chipotle history. Overall, we're going to be a much more agile, innovative and visible brand that people will talk about. \nAgain, I'm thrilled to be part of Chipotle. We've made a ton of progress in the last few months, but the best is yet to come. \nBrian, back over to you.\nExecutives: Thanks, Chris. We expect that all of these initiatives across marketing, digital, consumer access, menu, analytics and operations combined will create a flywheel that can drive transactions to accelerate our growth. To put it another way, we will amplify our unique positioning, real ingredients, real cooking, real opportunity and now through our new strategy, real performance. \nI'll turn over to Jack now to discuss the short-term financial implications of the restructuring we are undertaking to execute on and align behind the strategy that will unlock our brand's potential.\nExecutives: Thanks, Brian. Before I begin, I want to remind everyone that we're not providing a financial update on our current quarter and we're not updating or reaffirming the guidance provided on our last earnings call. \nEverything you've heard today about our focus on running great restaurants, modernizing and digitizing our restaurants and becoming a more relevant and engaging brand is designed to drive transactions, improve our unit economics, accelerate our earnings growth and create significant shareholder value. While it's too early to predict the timing and precise impact each of these strategies will have on result, I'm confident that the strategies will lead to higher average unit volumes and higher margins in the future. \nAll of these opportunities are going through a new stage-gate process designed to ensure successful rollouts. As we move through those stage gates over the coming year, we'll have a better understanding around the timing of when these new initiatives will translate to sales growth. In the meantime, we know that a combination of great operations, clever marketing and pushing further into our digital initiatives will drive near-term sales growth.\nExecuting these strategies at a high level will require changes to our organization and to our culture, and that will result in nonrecurring charges during the second quarter and over the next few quarters. We'll clearly call out these nonrecurring charges as they're incurred each quarter so that you will have a clear perspective of the underlying progress we're making in our business results. These nonrecurring costs primarily relate to the moving of our offices, the restructuring of our organization and the closing of underperforming restaurants. \nIn aggregate, we expect these costs to be in the range of $115 million to $135 million. Of that amount, we expect about $50 million to $60 million will hit the second quarter. And while most of the remaining charges will hit in 2018, there will likely be some charges, particularly related to terminating restaurant and office leases, that will spill into 2019. As a result of our review of underperforming restaurants, we expect to close between 55 and 65 restaurants, including the 5 Pizzeria Locale restaurants located outside of Denver. \nThe second quarter charge will include about $30 million related to restaurant asset write-offs, while the lease buyout costs for these restaurants will be charged over the next several quarters. About half of the restaurants will close within the next 30 days, and the remainder will close over the next several quarters as we negotiate lease buyouts with our landlords. The nonrecurring costs will primarily be reflected in 3 line items: G&A, the loss on disposal and impairment of assets, and depreciation, and we'll clearly call these out -- these charges out each quarter.\nIn addition to the $115 million to $135 million estimated charges, we'll also write off about $10 million in deferred tax assets over the next few quarters as fully vested, but underwater stock options will expire as we complete the restructure of the organization. This deferred tax write-off will hit our tax rate and is in addition to the tax rate impact we discussed on our Q1 call. \nWe'll provide more color on the quarterly timing of all future nonrecurring costs when we have more certainty around that timing. In future earnings calls and releases, our quarterly disclosures will clearly break out onetime costs from normal recurring costs so you can follow the underlying trends. We're confident that following these strategies would lead to better customer experience, stronger customer loyalty, better unit economics and the creation of significant shareholder value.\nI'll now turn the call back over to Brian.\nExecutives: Thanks, Jack. When I first spoke to you on our Q1 call, I shared how excited I was about the opportunity to lead Chipotle in its next chapter of growth and to build on a strong foundation of a well-loved brand that has a ton of growth optionality and one of the best economic models in the industry. As Jack mentioned, driving transaction growth is the single biggest lever enhancing our economic model, but we will also be scrappy and find efficiencies to add a tailwind to our economic model. \nThe combination of top line growth and margin expansion will ultimately lead to increased store growth, and I could not be more excited about the future of Chipotle. Capitalizing on that opportunity requires us to build a new culture of creativity, action and accountability. The realignment of the organization we are undertaking this year is a significant effort. And while it is potentially disruptive in the short term, it is good for our customers and our shareholders and will result in a much stronger organization that is structured to innovate and execute successfully to win today and cultivate a better future, and to capitalize on the wealth of opportunities for many years to come. I can easily see a future where Chipotle more than doubles revenue to over $10 billion. \nSo as I've outlined today, our 5 focus areas that will drive sales and transactions as part of our growth turnaround: #1, becoming a more culturally relevant and engaging brand that builds love and loyalty; #2, digitizing and modernizing our restaurant experience that creates a more convenient and enjoyable guest experience; #3, running great restaurants with great hospitality and throughput; #4, being disciplined and focused to enhance our powerful economic model; and #5, building a great culture that can innovate and execute across digital, access, menu and the restaurant experience.\nOkay. Before we open up the call to questions, I'd like to show you a quick video clip of the Chipotle of the future.\n[Presentation]\nExecutives: We have our executive leadership team here with us today available to answer your questions. As a reminder, we will discuss our second quarter results on our July 26 earnings call. And we'll now open up the line for questions regarding our strategic outlook. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Nicole Miller from Piper Jaffray.\nAnalysts: Appreciate the update. I find it very fascinating how you talk about the brand previously being somewhat silent, and I want to understand if you've measured perhaps aided versus unaided awareness or some other measure, and how will you be measuring the relevancy going forward beside the obvious same-store sales performance?\nExecutives: Sure. So this is Brian. So what we've been tracking is we have a brand tracker that tracks both top-of-mind awareness as well as kind of what people are saying about the brand. And what we have seen, now it's a fairly new study that started back in February, so we don't have that much historical data on it, is an opportunity to improve from where we are today. We also, as I mentioned in the call, we've just placed a foundational study which is going to give us some key metrics on the brand that we'll be tracking going forward. And we're going to use the combination, obviously, of sales performance, top-of-mind awareness and then some key brand metrics that we'll be defining once we've finalized all this foundational research that's coming back.\nAnalysts: And then you also mentioned you're not at peak transactions and I think I was measuring it earlier today around just over 400 on about 1.9 million AUV in a $12 to $13 average check. And I think, historically, there were stores that, at peak, could do that maybe in an hour, so just a quick 2-part question. Do you get more transactions by extending hours? Or do you get more transactions at peak? And I was just curious to know how does the system do at peak? What are the number of transactions currently?\nExecutives: Yes. I'll answer this and then I can have Scott chime in as well. But we believe there's more opportunity for transactions at peak, so moving people through the line faster, and that goes back to what Scott really has implemented around things where people are clear on their roles and their accountabilities in being positioned so they're ready for the throughput that they're capable of doing. So that's what we're focused on. Scott, do you want to add anything?\nExecutives: Thanks, Brian. Nicole, I think it's something that we have really only begun to put a shoulder against over the last couple of months and we still have much work to do to really move our restaurants at the pace with which we moved prior. And so there's a lot of work going on from a training perspective to ensure we're focused on the right things as it relates to shift management overall at Chipotle, something we've got to do a better job of teaching, which a key component of is faster throughput. So more on that to come, but it is a high priority for us and something we're working against as we speak.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Tarantino from Baird.\nAnalysts: Brian, my question is about your growth outlook for the next few years, and 1 thing you didn't mention is how you're thinking about unit growth over that horizon. And I guess, as you think about the opportunity to improve the economic model, what do you need to see to either accelerate the growth or continue the type of growth that you've outlined for this year? And then I have a follow-up question about the restaurant economic model. I think you mentioned that there are opportunities to drive some efficiencies to provide a tailwind to that model, so could you just elaborate on what you meant by that statement as well.\nExecutives: Sure. So your first question regarding new units and the pace of development. First of all, the new unit economics we're getting right now are, I think, best-in-class. They're still returning north of 30%, so we're very optimistic about the new stores that we're opening. I will tell you, we'll -- the pace will increase as the business continues to recover the top line sales, and I think that is something that we're going to be smart about on how we ratchet that up going forward because the good news is the returns are there. And I think as the core business really gets itself back to a place of where it was performing, we can also then, at the same time, start enhancing the new unit development. So that's going to be the approach we're going to take, David. On your second question around efficiencies and the economic model for adding additional tailwind, this is really to the point of our culture where we're going to get a little scrappier on how we approach things. And obviously, the #1 way for us to see that margin expand is through the top line sales growth, but I think there's also some opportunities for us to get scrappy as we look at business on how we're spending our money and the areas where they're being spent on. So those are really the components that we're going to be looking at to make sure that we really maximize the economic model of the business.\nAnalysts: And then just a quick follow-up; maybe it's for you or for Jack. Any way to size up the opportunity on the costs side, either at the unit level and then you also, I think, mentioned that you're cutting out a few layers in the G&A structure. Should we think about those as opportunities that flow through to the bottom line or is that sort of an area where you cut and then reinvest somewhere else? So at least any thoughts on that at this stage.\nExecutives: Yes. David, this is Jack. On the G&A, the savings are going to be reinvested. We'll have a leaner, more nimble organization. You heard Brian talked about we've got skills gaps. We've already been filling a lot of those skills gaps, so I would say it's going to be reinvestment. G&A, we think about that as being similar. Once we get through some of these onetime charges, it'll be similar to percent of sales to what we've had in the past, I would say that excluding stock comp, so it's going to be reinvestment. The reinvestment is going to really be reinvested in things that will drive our growth. In terms of the economic model and what we can do for efficiency, it's too early to tell. I think it's more of a culture and an attitude. We're going to focus on fewer things, and the fewer things will either drive growth or they will enhance the economic model. And I think by focusing on these fewer things, we're going to expect we're going to get results. But as we identify the opportunities, David, in the coming quarters, we'll share more with you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore from Bernstein.\nAnalysts: I have 1 follow-up to an earlier question and then a question on technology. The follow-up was the goal of both improving throughput and then menu innovation and maybe adding items. And I think, historically, there was some sense internally that maybe those were inconsistent. So just is the answer technology? Is it what you're talking about in terms of really defining people's roles and where they should be? Or I guess, how do we reconcile what has always been known as a very simple model where it felt like every time something was added, for example, queso, something else had to come out with what we're hearing in terms of menu innovation? And then I have another question.\nExecutives: Sure. So obviously, one of the key criteria for us as we go through the stage-gate process with any new menu item is going to be the impact on throughput, whether it improves throughput because we've added new capability with equipment or some technology advancement, meaning it moves to the second make-line, something along those lines. But one of the key criteria for anything to get to the national phase is going to be a throughput element. And what we've seen is there are some menu items that we believe have a high probability of having no impact on throughput. There are other menu items that are going to come with the requirement of probably some equipment investment and a real understanding of how do we tweak the process if we wanted to be able to maintain the same level throughput that we have today. So obviously, the second one that I just talked about is going to take a little bit longer from a testing and a validation standpoint than a menu item that has no impact on throughput or the process or equipment. So that's where the stage-gate process becomes a very important piece of the puzzle, so that we really understand the impact on our operations, the consumer and the team member and then, obviously, the financials. So we'll be leaning into that stage-gate process to ensure we find the power of throughput and innovation.\nAnalysts: Understood. And then just on the technology piece. I thought I heard you say you're going to add delivery capabilities to your app, and I think that's something that no one else yet has done in terms of the companies partnering with third party. It has been companies with in-house delivery that have been able to do that. So I mean, maybe talk about how you've leapfrogged some of what we've seen elsewhere or whether you think that is going to be a meaningful distinction between what we're seeing with other restaurants that are partnering with third-party aggregators.\nExecutives: Yes. So I'll hand it over to Curt, but let me answer your couple of questions there. Obviously, one of the things we're really excited about with delivery is our model results in food that gets delivered with great speed. And one of the things that we're really excited about in our DoorDash partnership is we saw that speed first-hand relative to all your other food alternatives on the DoorDash website. So we're very excited about the idea of being able to once you're in our app, stay in the app and get people the access opportunity to have Chipotle delivered to their home because I think people are going to be excited about the speed at which they can get Chipotle delivered to them. I don't know if we're the only ones with delivery in our app, but I'll hand it over to Curt to see if he wants to add anything.\nExecutives: Yes, I'll just -- I'll follow up by saying we're really excited, Sara, about this launch and those tests coming in later in the year. And as Brian has said, we're a learning organization now. So it's early days, and we're excited to see how customers respond and how we can continue to make digital the easiest way to Chipotle.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Glass from Morgan Stanley.\nAnalysts: My first question is just simply a time line question. Brian, when should we expect to start to see the results of some of these initiatives coming into play, specifically in the back half of this year? Is that an unreasonable expectation? Do you expect, for example, a product launch in the third quarter? And is there something on the marketing front? You talked about a lot of pieces and a lot of need to rebuild some capabilities. So what's a reasonable expectation of the type -- 2 or 3 examples of things that should happen inside of this year, let's say?\nExecutives: Yes. So what I can definitely share with you is you're going to start to see us testing programs in the back half of this year. So you'll see these tests happening in -- with some food ideas. You'll see some tests happening with digital, loyalty. And we're very excited about all those. Now depending on how things perform in that stage-gate process, we'll dictate the timetable for which we roll it out because one of the things that I think is important for the organization is we iterate, we listen, we learn before we then decide to go with a national launch. So we're in the early days of validating these propositions. And once we start moving them through the stage-gate process, we'll be sharing when they will actually be hitting the national programs going forward.\nAnalysts: Okay. So I guess, go slow to go fast, in other words, to make sure that you're getting them right when you do launch them.\nExecutives: That's correct.\nAnalysts: Okay. And then remodels was discussed last call or maybe 2 calls ago as something a 2019 effort. Maybe that was before you arrived. Do you look at the businesses needing a substantial remodel, a light remodel, or how do you view the physical assets? And how do you phase that into these other initiatives?\nExecutives: Yes. So we have an initiative called the big fix, and that is happening. I'm happy to say we're on track to be finished by the end of this year. I think we're exactly 50% of the way done right now. And this is really where we are bringing our -- all of our restaurants up to date. It's fixing the lights, the painting. It brings them back to a, I would say, a Class 1 restaurant experience. Separate from that, we also have an effort going on with a redesign, which is kind of the Chipotle restaurant of the future. And that is going to be -- you'll see that going into some testing in the back half of this year. Probably right around the fall time frame, you'll see us going into New York City.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia from William Blair.\nAnalysts: It's Sharon Zackfia, but that was a good try. I guess, a couple of questions. Now that digital is up to around 9% of sales, I'm just wondering if you've been able to harness that data at all and kind of incent to consumer behavior in different ways. I don't know where you are on that. And then if you could give us some perspective, once you launch loyalty, kind of when you'll be able to use that data to then kind of create new customer behavior. And then lastly, I don't think you mentioned international at all. So just if there's any thought on what to do with the international locations.\nExecutives: Sure. So your first question around digital and loyalty and, I guess, more importantly, the data approach to remarketing or incentivizing our customers. That's absolutely part of our approach going forward. One of the things I'm really excited about as we get this pilot going with our loyalty program, we're going to start to move to, really, the tailored data-specific marketing that then can use the currency in the rewards program to drive certain behaviors, incent certain products, incent certain experiences. And we think that's going to be a key unlock for the business going forward because as this business goes from 10% plus in digital sales, that presents an opportunity for us to have more customers in our business, engaging at a different level than they have in the past. And then when you layer on top of that a loyalty program with a strong CRM engine, I think really exciting things will be unlocked as we roll out loyalty on a national basis in 2019. Your second question was on international. For now, international is something that we are managing. It's not an aggressive part of our plan for growth. We're focusing the aggressive growth in the U.S. business, and that's why we outlined this right now.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Karen Holthouse from Goldman Sachs.\nAnalysts: Two questions that go back to some of the prepared remarks. There is a comment on opportunities to enhance the value proposition across dayparts. And then I think as it relates to value, the only specific thing mentioned was a happy hour test. Are there other things you're looking at in terms of pricing or sizing in other dayparts or is that really more of a comment on the overall customer experience potentially layering in loyalty? And then second, it would seem like some of this sort of foundational consumer research is really going to feed back into some of these tests and other strategy. How long is it until you think you get sort of the base level of data in place for that?\nExecutives: Sure. So your first question on the value and how we see that playing out. You're exactly right. We see using our rewards program as a great way to present targeted value and incentives for customers when they want it, where they want it and how they want it. Combine that with then providing some value that matches up with a daypart like the happy hour, which matches more of like a snacking occasion, I think, then we have to provide the right value equation for a snacking occasion between the hours of 3 to 5 p.m. So those are our lead-in ideas. And then, obviously, the key piece of the puzzle is always understanding our price equation as well. And what will be important is we'll continue to make sure we understand how consumers are interacting with the menu and where we see opportunities to enhance our value proposition. We will do it in a smart fashion. Your second question on the timing of the consumer foundation research. Yes, absolutely, this will inform pretty much the entire business. And we're really excited. We're going to start getting some of the preliminary results back here in the next month, and then we'll have the entire package back by the time we did the fall. So we're already starting to get some learnings back. And it's very exciting because it's new knowledge for the company, and it's new insight into our customers, which I think is going to be hugely valuable for us going forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe from JPMorgan.\nAnalysts: A couple follow-ups. Firstly, when you make delivery available on your app, what percentage of stores will that currently cover?\nExecutives: Oh, good. So are -- you're talking about the in-app delivery experience? What is that percentage, Curt?\nAnalysts: Yes, exactly.\nExecutives: John, to start, we will be covering approximately 1,500 restaurants and expect to get to around 2,000 restaurants by the end of the year.\nAnalysts: Okay, perfect. That's a big number. Secondly, Jack, I think, the question for you. I mean, you mention G&A being similar as a percentage of sales into the path, excluding executive comp. The path has actually shown some variability in terms of G&A, and obviously, executive stock comp -- executive comp is actually a big percentage of that. So as we think about '19 and '20, post the move, some of the restructurings and some of the hires, I mean, can you help us just get closer to a number in terms of what G&A should be as a percentage of sales for a company of this size? And that includes -- including stock comp.\nExecutives: Well, including the stock comp, it's tough only because when the stock moves, stock comp moves pretty dramatically as well. So the thing we can control is the underlying G&A that we spend on people, offices, things like that. I think, as we get through a lot of these nonrecurring charges, our current underlying G&A is in the, call it, low 5% to mid-5% range. When you add in stock comp, you're in the mid- to high 6s or something like that. I think that, as we get through, all of these adjustments with our offices and our structure will still be in that same kind of range. Now once we get to that range, as we build sales with the strategies that you've heard today, we've been able to lever G&A in the past, and I expect we'll be able to lever G&A in the future. I think the important thing is that our G&A will be in a similar pattern. What's really going to drive is we're going to drive top line sales that will drive our margins, that will drive unit economics. And that's where I think most of our shareholder value is going to come from.\nAnalysts: And then 2 quick ones. Brian, to your previous experience and especially on the operating side, how do you think about the right prime cost, food and paper plus labor for Chipotle? I mean, that's a line that's actually changed quite a lot over the course of the history of this company, but do you think about it at the 60% range? Do you think about it at 55%, somewhere in between? I mean, is there is something that you think about on the prime cost side in terms of what this business should be over the course of the cycle?\nExecutives: Yes, John, this is Jack. Right now, we're in kind of the 60% range. Our model works quite well. We're in the 60% range, but you know very well that it wasn't that long ago we were in the 55% range. And that's how you get margins in the mid- to high 20% range. We have the ability to get back to that, but it all depends on the top line. And so the strategies that you've heard today are very heavily weighted towards driving the top line, bringing customers in, making the brand relevant again. If we do all that well, we have the ability to get those prime costs back into some of our historical ranges.\nAnalysts: And that's a very important point. And then finally, when you mentioned $10 billion of your sales for the Chipotle U.S. brand, how many stores does that contemplate in your current thinking in terms of optimizing that portfolio?\nExecutives: Yes. Look, the way we think about it is you could easily be around 5,000 stores at some point while we're exceeding $10 billion.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays.\nAnalysts: Two questions. First, just Brian, I know you talked about being pleased with the underlying sales trends. Just wondering from our side of the seat, and the compares are obviously difficult to read, though, on the 2 year. Just wondering, what measures do you focus on perhaps daily or weekly or monthly, whether it's variability by geography or daypart or product line? We're just trying to figure out how you define success in your seat in terms of the comp growth. And then I had a follow-up on the supply chain.\nExecutives: Sure. So look, we are watching sales and transactions every day, and we look at it by region and by daypart. And what we continue to see is good performance in all the dayparts. And we're optimistic that the continued improvement in throughput and operational execution will continue to support the sales trends that we've seen to date. And then obviously, going forward, the plan is to accelerate the sales and transactions with the initiatives that we put through the stage-gate process that then we have a high level of confidence that we'll grow the business. So that's what we're looking at. That's the scorecard we keep an eye on, on a daily basis. The other key thing we also look at is obviously what percent of our business is growing through the [ second and eight month ] because this is an indicator of how we're doing on driving our digital and off-premise business.\nAnalysts: Got you. And just separately on the supply chain side of things. I mean, there was mention of Food with Integrity and that you talked about authenticity and transparency, which sounds like conference calls from years past. Just wondering, how much time have you spent focused on the supply chain? Maybe what changes do you think need to come? Obviously, there's big risk in the supply chain, and as you enhance kind of new products and whatnot, I'm just wondering your thoughts on the supply[-side ] changes that have been put in place and what we should expect going forward.\nExecutives: Yes, sure. So a couple of things. One, I think I mentioned this in my prepared remarks. Maybe I didn't. But we've hired a new supply chain leader. And it's probably the first time in a long time that we've had, what I would call, a real expert in the supply chain space leading our supply chain efforts. He's 2, maybe 3 weeks into the job now. Very excited about him getting into the role and helping us figure out our next chapter on how we work with our suppliers and partners on our supply chain. And then to answer your question, my ability to get out and meet some folks. I've had the opportunity to meet with our 2 of our bigger partners, OSI and Miniat. And the thing that I love about our partnerships is they're as equally excited about the food as we are. And to have that commitment to that quality is usually valuable. And then obviously, we'll figure out how we view it in the most efficient fashion. But when you have that shared value of commitment to quality and excellence and Food with Integrity and really trying to move things to another level, it makes for a powerful partnership. So I'm very excited about Carlos joining the work, and I'm very excited about my early conversations with some of our key suppliers.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Charles from Cowen and Co.\nAnalysts: It's actually Brian Vieten on for Andrew. And if I could just ask maybe 2 around digital. So in terms of the app, as we look out kind of the adoption curve, what do you guys view as sort of the biggest hurdles to break into the fray in sort of offering consumers a compelling reason to download the app? The confidence is always -- is encouraging, but thus far, we've kind of seen this as a challenge, not only for fast-casual, but sort of the broader restaurant industry. And then in your answer to Sara, I believe, it sounded like maybe once customers download the app, delivery can drive sort of deeper engagement with the app. But what are the bigger hurdles you see to breaking through the fray and driving that adoption on an in-house app? And just secondly, from a marketing perspective, in the spirit of moving away from promotions and more towards a centralized approach, from a delivery or mobile app perspective, does that mean marketing will center more so on media ads? Or could that have more of a promotional element?\nExecutives: Sure. So look, I think our biggest hurdle on the app, frankly, is just awareness. Right now, I think, I was just looking at some numbers, but more than 50%, I think it's like 52% of people aren't even aware that we have an app. And I think this goes back to the question somebody asked me earlier, why do you believe the brand isn't as visible as it should be? It's things like this that are, I think, key growth engines for the business that we just have really low awareness on. So job #1 is to get people aware of the app because I think they're going to love the experience, based on the users that are already in the app. And then job 2 is how do you get them to continue to use it. Well, I think we have a key -- continue to provide utility in that app, adding things like delivery, adding a loyalty program. These are things that will continue to provide utility for them because then what we'll be able to do is get into this game of one-to-one communication and really change the level of engagement with our customer through that app experience. So it's going to be a combination of things that, I think, ultimately move the app forward. But I think the biggest challenge for us first and foremost is making people aware that they have the app. Then you don't need experience that gives them a reason to keep using it, right? So the whole experience then is just superior to anything else they've seen where when they order, they pick it up, the order is accurate, the speed is like nothing they've seen. If it's getting delivered, it's at a level of speed that they haven't seen, with accuracy that they haven't seen and then, obviously, layer in the idea of loyalty. I think you start building utility for why people are going to adopt the usage over time. What was your second question?\nAnalysts: Great. Yes, just secondly, just from a marketing perspective, I know you guys have talked about sort of moving away from promotions and sort of more towards a centralized marketing approach. But just from a delivery or mobile app adoption perspective, just wondering, does that mean the marketing to get those sign-ups will center more so on sort of media ads? Or could that have more of a promotional element of maybe a coupon or something to that effect?\nExecutives: Look, what we're going to be moving towards is programs that, I think, are going to engage and connect at a different level than we have in the past. And how we choose to connect will be driven by the users that we're trying to persuade with the experience that we provide. So you're going to see us be very present in digital, mobile, all the nontraditional mediums. And you're also going to see us show up in the traditional mediums because, I think, at the end of the day, and Chris, feel free to chime in here, we want to be relevant and engaged with all category users like medium and heavy. And to do that, that means our marketing program has to be comprehensive and find people at the right times when they're interested in engaging with Chipotle. Chris, I don't know if you want to add anything.\nExecutives: Yes. I think, look, we'll -- you got to use all the tools at your disposal. And there will certainly be some promotional things. We'll continue some of the promotional things that we've done in the past. But overall, you'll see a pullback in promotional activity in favor of the more centralized marketing and driving awareness and, hopefully, transactions and traffic that will follow that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Matt McGinley from Evercore ISI.\nAnalysts: On the unit growth and the CapEx, and Brian, I appreciate that the economic model of the restaurant and the top line is what supports future unit growth. But the development pipeline for units is not a short one, typically. And this year, you guys had slowed the unit growth, but you ramped up the investment in existing stores, remodels and just investment in digital and things like that. But it doesn't sound like you want to put out a specific growth number or you would have done so. But does the present new unit run rate seem like that's the right pace of growth? Or -- and then I guess, secondly, is the investment that you made in CapEx in those new stores, is that unique to 2018, or is it something that we should expect more spending on, on existing units in the future?\nExecutives: Yes. Look, I think when we get to the fall, we'll be in a better position to talk through exactly how we're seeing the new unit growth. But I think, like we said in the last earnings call, we see at or better in 2019. And to your point, the development pipeline is an 18-month pipeline. So what is good news is we're seeing great economic results in the new restaurants we're opening, and we're liking the economic model that we have in our current restaurants as we continue to see additional sales strength. And then your question on the CapEx as it was allocated in the big fix. The big fix is just that, it's a big fix, where we're coming in to probably make up for some time that we should have been doing it over time that we didn't. And so as a result, we are coming in and doing it. But I do think, going forward, one of the things that's going to be important is we don't find ourselves falling behind on our restaurants. That's something we don't want to repeat, but we'll be able to share more details on that front probably around the fall.\nAnalysts: And on the store closures, other than being unprofitable, is there a common theme on the age of the store, the location or the geography that -- amongst these 60 or so that you're going to wind up closing?\nExecutives: Not really. There's no common theme. I don't -- Jack, I don't know if you want to add anything to that.\nExecutives: Yes. No, they're all over the place. They're of various ages. Some are a couple years old. Some are 15 years old. We literally just culled the list, found all the restaurants that were cash flow bleeders, went through to look at every single site, looked at quality of the real estate, quality of the team, the sales trend, and we made a decision. And frankly, we don't close stores very often, so we didn't like closing these, but these are ones that we just didn't see getting to or above breakeven for some period of time. But they were all over the place. There's nothing that's broken with our approach to our real estate pipeline. These just were random misses.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bittner from Oppenheimer and Company.\nAnalysts: But do you plan, at any point, to give us a more detailed look into how you expect all of this to impact the financials, whether that be through the establishment of financial targets or goals or for something else? And then I have a follow-up.\nExecutives: The -- so look, we have not changed any of our expectations for the year. And then, I think, as we get through the stage-gate process for these various initiatives, we'll have a high level of confidence with what that performance looks like, which then obviously, as these things unfold, we will share with you the progress that we're making in the business. The point of today's conversation was to share with you the strategy for how we see the growth unfolding. And as we start to validate that growth, we will share with you how that's impacting all the financial targets and the subsequent pieces of the puzzle that come with it.\nAnalysts: Okay. And just as you set out to drive this top line strategy, I mean, should we expect all the incremental sales growth from this strategy to be highly incremental to profits and margins and just drive significant operating leverage? Or are we -- should we be expecting some type of in-store operating expense step-up to drive this strategy or capital expense step-up or whatnot just on the investment side?\nExecutives: Look, what we're looking for, obviously, is incremental profitable growth, right? That's what we are first and foremost after. With that said, various initiatives are going to have varying degrees of incrementality. And what I'm excited about is -- the preliminary look is we've got a lot of exciting things that we're going to start putting through our stage-gate process that it's going to start validating how incremental these programs are and then how that flows through the economic model. So -- but yes, of course, the goal is incremental, profitable sales growth. That's why we're vetting these ideas.\nAnalysts: Understood. And just final question for me. Just, Brian, can you comment on moving the headquarters from Denver to Southern California? What are the primary benefits you expect to harness from this move?\nExecutives: Sure. I think, as we mentioned in here, we're going to be building more marketing, more digital, more menu, data analytics, varying areas of expertise. And we think we have the ability to really transform the organization in a faster fashion by relocating the company. So that's the [ precipitous ] for doing it. And there's lots of talent on the West Coast and across the entire country that, frankly, wants to be a part of the Chipotle journey. So we're very excited about the restructuring, the relocation and the new culture and talent that we'll be building.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris O'Cull from Stifel.\nAnalysts: It's actually Mitch on for Chris. A question about catering and the opportunity around that. You recently announced options for smaller groups in different pricing tiers. Curious, are you pleased with those effects of those actions? And are you employing other initiatives to grow that business, perhaps putting more marketing dollars behind it?\nExecutives: Go ahead, Chris.\nExecutives: We view catering as a big opportunity and highly incremental opportunity. I think that they -- drilling down to a package size and a price point that's a little bit more accessible should open up that market even further and give us some more flexibility. It certainly is on our radar screen from a digital ordering standpoint. So we're just racking and stacking that with all of the other mobile and digital and delivery initiatives that we have. We will be putting dedicated resources against it going forward because we do think it's a good opportunity. So we think that in -- with the rest of the suite, mobile and digital ordering and delivery and everything, that catering is a key aspect for us. And we'll see how this new rollout of this smaller one goes. And we'll pour the gas to the tanks that deliver the most incremental profit for us. And we'll continue to evaluate others to help optimize those. So we love catering. We think it will be awesome. We think it's a huge opportunity, and we'll just take and sequence it with everything else.\nAnalysts: Okay. And then just a follow-up question on loyalty. I'm curious whether you have done any studies to gauge consumer demand for this. And if so, what have they showed?\nExecutives: Yes, we have. And actually, this is one of the top consumer requests for Chipotle to provide. It's a -- this is going to be one that's going to be a customer pleaser.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Gregory Francfort from Bank of America.\nAnalysts: I got 2 questions. The first is, just after you do the tax write-off, I think part of the reason the tax rate was staying high the next couple of years is because the stock was down. What -- if you sort of write that off, what do you think this ongoing tax rate's going to be? And then more from a bigger picture, Brian, how do you envision the operational flow of the line? And as you go out and test in these new store prototypes, are you going to be putting in new equipment for new products? And if so, where do you think that goes? And just any changes to the structure of flow of the line as you see it today or opportunities to kind of change that to improve the labor efficiency or anything along that line.\nExecutives: Well, why don't I answer the second question, and I'll hand it over to Jack on the tax. So to answer your question, any new item that we bring in, one of the things that I'm very cognizant of is today, the reason why we have $2 million AUVs is because we're selling burritos, bowls and tacos at a tremendous throughput. And that model has to be protected. So as I mentioned earlier, one of the key criteria is anything we bring in cannot cause us to go backwards from a throughput standpoint, okay? Now with that said, there's going to be products that we may introduce new equipment that, I think, will improve the experience for the customer when they order something that maybe doesn't go down the line the way it always has. We may have to put a piece of equipment in a different place so that you move from a customer-facing line where things are flowing to where it moves off, uses a piece of equipment but then gets back to that register and expediter in the right timing so that the flow is uninterrupted. And you see this happen in a lot of other restaurants. The key is, though, you have to take the time to make sure you understand the time and motion involved with the new equipment and the new menu item. And so we're going to take that time. We're not going to rush it when you got something that is going to be a difference to the current line optimization that we have today. And the initiative that utilizes the current line optimization probably will be able to move through the stage-gate process a lot faster. So yes, that is going to be the approach. But I just want to clarify. I mean, one of the things that is -- and I think I've said this in my remarks. One of the things that is exciting for me that I discovered is just better understanding how powerful this operating model is. The economics and the food and the team member experience that all happens with this line is a real gem, and we have to protect it. And fortunately, one of the other gems we have is that second make-line, which allows us then to do a lot of this digital business, off-premise business, without impacting that customer-facing line at all. If anything, it creates a lot more capacity in the restaurant, and it creates an even more attractive economic model when you start ramping up on that digital make-line, or second make-line. So I'm really excited about how we can use technology, loyalty, access and some menu innovation to really, I think, drive incremental growth that helps us protect our throughput and, hopefully, improve on it. Jack, I don't know if you want to get the tax.\nExecutives: Yes, Greg. Chris was volunteering, but I'll take it, Chris. Yes, Greg, our underlying tax rate is 28.8%, and I went through that in quite a bit of detail on the first quarter call. So you might want to go back to the transcript on that. Our rate is going to be higher, in the high 30s. It was in high 30s the first quarter. It will be about that rate in the fourth quarter. These are related to -- they're not economic. They're not cash. The thing I mentioned today about a $10 million write-off, these are deferred tax assets that were put on the books when our stock was at a much higher level. We're expecting with the restructuring that stock options are going to be -- they're going to be forfeited. They're vested, they're going to be forfeited as we restructure. So there's no tax deduction available. But there's also no expense available either. Those options are not going to be exercised at all. It's just an imperfection in the way accounting leaves the expense on the books. Tax will never allow a deduction when there is not an actual cost involved and so -- but these are noneconomic. They don't take out any cash out of our balance sheet. And they're very difficult to predict. In a normal environment where the stock continues to increase, you won't see this type of stuff. As we see this stuff coming, I'll warn you about it, and we'll tell you about it each quarter, about these unusual write-off of deferred tax assets.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Peter Saleh from BTIG.\nAnalysts: Brian, I think you touched on this in your last comment. But can you talk about the margin profile or maybe the throughput capability of that digitally enhanced second make-line?\nExecutives: Well, I probably won't get into the specifics of the margin associated with it. But what I can tell you is it obviously runs with less labor. It's in the 3 people needed in order to execute the second make-line versus 6 or 7 people on the customer-facing line at peak. So that obviously is a nice tailwind for the second make-line. And then the other piece that we love about it is the accuracy and the speed associated with using that second make-line is also another really powerful tool because now, with our second make-line, we can literally tell everybody, \"You can skip the line when you order online.\" And that's going to be, I think, a powerful message in the Chipotle business going forward.\nAnalysts: And then just my last question. On the loyalty program, are you envisioning this to be a digital-only loyalty program? Or will this be something similar to what you had in the past with like a physical presence in the store?\nExecutives: I'm going to let Curt answer that one. He's the master of all things loyalty.\nExecutives: Peter, the loyalty program will be available in restaurant as well as online, but there will not be a physical card. So a customer will create an account, a loyalty account, digitally, and they can use their phone to present that account either on the register or, as Brian has said, the fastest way to order is to order digitally where that number will just be placed as part of that ordering process.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nick Setyan from Wedbush.\nAnalysts: Just on pricing, as mid-single-digit labor inflation is ongoing, and food costs may not remain as benign as they've been this year. How are you thinking about your pricing strategy going forward? And then just specifically, how are you thinking about pricing in 2019?\nExecutives: Yes, so we've not made any decisions on our pricing for 2019. But our approach to pricing will be, obviously, looking at the metrics you just talked about, and then you obviously have to put the customer into that equation as well. So that's the approach we're going to be taking: understanding what's going on with our food cost and paper cost, combined with our labor cost and then managing that relative to what our customers' expectation is on a great value proposition and then also how much growth we foresee the business to also overcome some of the inflation. So we're going to take a comprehensive view, and we will approach it that way every year.\nAnalysts: And I guess, just a follow-up maybe for Jack. As we kind of think about transaction growth, assuming there's no pricing in 2019, what kind of transaction growth do you think is necessary for us to be able to lever at the unit level?\nExecutives: Yes. I mean, if you have -- it depends on the inflation. But if you have inflation of like labor inflation, for example, of somewhere in the mid-single digits, which is what we've been running, you need to get like a mid-single-digit, transaction-driven comp just to stay even on the restaurant cash flow line. You'll still -- you'll delever on labor, but you'll make it up in some of the other line items, and you'll about break even. So I think, in this kind of environment, you have to be considering a combination of transaction growth and a well-thought-out, as Brian mentioned, price increase to try to offset both so that as you're growing transactions, you'll at least hold at macro margins.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jon Tower from Wells Fargo.\nAnalysts: I know it's getting late, so I'll try to be quick with these. Just first one for Jack. If you can quantify what the drag was or will be from those 55 to 65 stores that you're planning on closing, what sort of drag that was on store-level margins. Second, I guess, this is for Brian or Chris. In terms of making the brand more visible over time, is that going to require a higher spend going forward from a marketing standpoint? I think that's run roughly about 3% of sales, historically. And then lastly, now that you're doing all this brand research in the early learnings, have you better determined where some of that lost traffic has gone since the food crisis, meaning other fast-casual brands or fast food? That's it.\nExecutives: Yes, I guess, we'll take in order. This is Jack. In the restaurant-level margin, those restaurants were well under $1 million. They were all cash flow losers. When they're all fully closed, we should expect a margin improvement of 30 basis points or more. Now keep in mind, we're closing about half or so in the first month, and then the others will be -- happen over time as we negotiate with the leases. So this won't be -- this won't hit all at one time, but eventually, when they're all closed, we should pick up 30 basis points or perhaps a little more.\nExecutives: Yes, it's Chris. I'll take the conversation about the overall marketing budget. I think that, you're right, we have about a 3% marketing budget. I think our opportunity, certainly in the short term, is to be more efficient and effective with the existing dollars that we have. But one of the beauties of having an innovation pipeline in the stage-gate process and a testing protocol is that you can test varying levels and so you have a much better certainty about what you're doing and as you go national once you've tested it in a test market. So we'll simulate different levels of spending, and then we can decide as we go forward whether those delivered on what we wanted to or not. And so over time, you might be able to lean into some products, and some products, you may not. So I think that's part of the beauty of having a defined process and an innovation process and an innovation pipeline, so that you can pick and choose what works the best. In terms of the question about where they went and who we source from, I think that's a big part of the foundation of research. I think one of the beauties of Chipotle, though, is that we have a great balance of getting consumers not only from just QSR and other fast-casual but even from casual dine, and also, we have a great mix of both men and women. So it's a really widely appealing brand, and I think that's a big opportunity for us to appeal to category users from a more centralized marketing standpoint than just a more decentralized promotional base marketing plan that we've had in the past.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I now would like to turn the call back to management for closing remarks.\nExecutives: All right. Well, thank you, everybody. And hopefully, you have clarity on our strategy for how we're going to cultivate a better world and win today. And thank you for everybody's time and your interest in Chipotle. Have a good night.\nOperator: This concludes tonight's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."

         "Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Chipotle. Please go ahead.\nExecutives: Hi, everyone, and welcome to our call today. By now, you should have access to our earnings announcement released this afternoon for the second quarter of 2018.\nIt may also be found on our Investor Relations website at ir.chipotle.com.\nBefore we begin our presentation, I will remind everyone that parts of our discussion today will include forward-looking statements as defined in the securities laws.\nThese forward-looking statements will include statements regarding the expected benefits from our strategic focus areas or specific business initiative; the potential opportunity for our digital sales; sales trends and forecasts for future comparable sales; expected new restaurant openings; estimates of future food, labor, marketing and maintenance and repair costs; statements about our expected effective tax rate and projections of the amount and timing of unusual cost items and stock repurchases as well as other statements of our expectations and plans.\nThese statements are based on information available to us today, and we are not assuming any obligation to update them.\nForward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.\nWe refer you to the risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K as updated and our subsequent Form 10-Qs for discussion of these risks.\nOur discussion today will also include non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations of which can be found on the Presentation page of the Investor Relations section of our website. I'd also like to remind everyone that we've adopted a self-imposed quiet period, restricting communications with investors during that period.\nThe quiet period will begin on the 16th day of the last month of each fiscal quarter and continues until the next earnings conference call.\nFor the third quarter of 2018, it will begin September 16 and continue through our third quarter earnings release.\nWe will start today's call with some prepared remarks from Brian Niccol, Chief Executive Officer; and Jack Hartung, Chief Financial Officer, after which we will take questions. In the room and also available during the Q&A period are: Scott Boatwright, Chief Restaurant Officer; Curt Garner, Chief Digital and Information Officer; Chris Brandt, Chief Marketing Officer; Laurie Schalow, Chief Communications Officer; and Marissa Andrada, Chief Human Resources Officer. \nAnd now I will turn the call over to Brian Niccol.\nExecutives: Thanks, Coralie, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report a solid second quarter with sales and restaurant-level margins ahead of our expectations. \nTotal sales grew 8.3% to $1.27 billion driven by comparable sales of 3.3% and 34 new restaurants opened in the quarter. This positive comparable sales trajectory enabled us to expand restaurant-level margins, which were up 90 basis points year-over-year to 19.7%. Earnings per share adjusted for unusual costs grew nearly 24% to $2.87, and our GAAP earnings were $1.68. \nWhile Jack will go through the financials in more detail shortly, I'd like to put these results into context by discussing how the work our 70,000 employees do every day contributed to these financial outcomes. \nLast month, we shared with you that we would execute our strategy to win today and cultivate the future by focusing on these 5 areas: becoming a more culturally relevant and engaging brand that builds love and loyalty; digitizing and modernizing our restaurant experience to create a more convenient and enjoyable guest experience; running great restaurants with great hospitality and throughput; being disciplined and focused to enhance our powerful economic model; and building a great culture that can innovate and execute across digital, access, menu and the restaurant experience. \nToday, I'll focus on how innovation in digital and access and how improving our operations contributed to this quarter's results. Let me begin with operations. \nWe know that strong sales growth and margins are dependent on great operations, which is the hallmark of any healthy brand. This brand was founded on outstanding operations and real food. We're getting back to our roots. When we have the right people leading the right teams and when those teams are well trained and operating with confidence, they execute great guest experiences. \nIt takes time to build a culture of accountability, and I'm pleased that we're seeing some encouraging signs of progress in key areas, namely, our restaurant AB scores, a measurement system we implemented 1.5 years ago to drive greater accountability, is trending in the right direction. We are doing a better job staffing our restaurants to match sales volumes, and we have lower year-over-year hourly turnover, which tells us we are making progress on training and building great teams. \nAdditionally, we have seen a meaningful decline in guest complaints, and with that, our guest satisfaction scores have improved since we started measuring them last year. This tells us that we made progress and that our guests are noticing the difference. We know that when the food is delicious, the feel of the restaurant is great, and we removed the friction from the flow of the order process no matter the channel, we delight customers.\nWhile I'm encouraged by our progress, we still have a lot of work to do. We have an opportunity to improve throughput, consistent execution of great food and consistent delivery of a great atmosphere. I'll outline some of the initiatives underway to address those opportunities. We are halfway through our big fix initiative, which is designed to bring our restaurants back up to standards and make them uniquely Chipotle. This not only improves the guest experience as the appearance of our restaurants is clean and well maintained for every guest, but the team member experience improves as well. \nWe overhauled our training material several months ago and have retrained 3/4 of our field leaders to Cultivate University. That's an in restaurant and in classroom 1 week training session that we launched in April. That investment in the ongoing development of our field leadership continue to drive crew member engagement. We're supplementing that training with the new hospitality training program in the restaurants, and we're in the early innings of refining our training to teach and taste the details, so that we achieve a winning combination of great food, feel and flow with every guest experience. \nWe are zeroing in on how to get back to great throughput. Speed of service is a foundational element of convenience that our guests truly value. Late last year, we rolled out what we call the owners pad, a comprehensive review of our restaurants performance. Equipping our field leaders with this tool is improving their powers of observation and allowing them to focus on the critical details of delivering improved guest experience. In addition, the tool creates teaching moments for their general managers and documents the corrective actions we're taking when needed. We're currently rolling out a digital version for mobile phones and tablets of this previous paper-based tool. That should result in more consistent operations across our restaurants. We'll have this in place nationally by October. \nWe're also in the process of redesigning our forecasting and labor scheduling tool. This is a significant undertaking but necessary for us to have accurate sales forecasting and deliver the right amount of labor at the right time to meet the needs of our guests. \nThe new tool will have a best-in-class sales forecasting component that will leverage machine learning to remove the guesswork of determining sales and labor needs for our business. In addition, our team members will have the ability to see their schedules remotely and swap shifts through mobile phones, taking these tasks out of the head of the Manager. We believe leveraging technologies such as this makes us a more desirable employer as we work to create a better experience for our crew members. We will continue to make investments in our restaurants because a better experience for our team members directly translates to a better experience for our guests. \nI'd also like to talk to you about the progress we are making around innovation in digital and access as this was a real bright spot in the quarter. Today, our annualized digital sales are approximately $0.5 billion. And we're in the early stages of this multibillion opportunity. Our digital sales grew 33% in the quarter and now account for 10.3% of sales, an acceleration from 20% growth in the first quarter. \nWe now have 4 million active monthly users across our app in our website, a 65% increase since the end of last year. Delivering group occasions were particularly strong this quarter. Delivery sales quadrupled in the quarter, and we know from our customer research that improving access to Chipotle is an important growth lever, whether it be through adding more restaurants or enabling more convenience like delivery. \nToday, delivery is available from 1,700 restaurants, and we expect that to reach 2,000 restaurants by year-end. We're also pleased that delivery is now an option available directly from our app. \nOur group ordering business was solid in the seasonally strong quarter for catering orders. In mid-July, we expanded our bill drone catering offer nationally, whereby we lowered the minimum size and offered more priced tiers for group orders, therefore expanding access for more occasions. We tested this enhancement early in the year and found that group order sales in our test stores outperformed the base by mid- to high single digits. \nDelivery availability for catering expanded to 2/3 of our restaurants in the quarter. As I've mentioned, Chipotle second make-line enables the business to handle the incremental growth without any impact on throughput or the in-restaurant experience. I'm happy to see progress on digitizing our second make-lines, which are now in roughly 500 restaurants. We're targeting approximately 1,000 restaurants to be enabled with digital second make-line by year-end. And we are accelerating our rollout to reach completion by the end of 2019. \nThese digital second make-lines have direct positive impact on the team member and guest experience. Also, the digital pickup shelf test in several New York City restaurants continues to show great promise. And based on the results to date, and we will be expanding the test to a larger number of restaurants in several markets next month. \nWe've mentioned before that we are undertaking a wide-ranging consumer research project with the results available this fall. I did, however, want to mention a few interesting highlights that we've uncovered so far access to the #1 lever we can pull to drive sales, which supports our new unit growth as well as the innovation focus around the access via our digital channels. Additionally, we see an interesting intersection between fast food and fast casual with many attributes such as value and speed that are typically associated with fast food and attributes such as quality and freshness, which are typically associated with fast-casual. \nwe we're particularly strong with millennial and Generation Z customers relative to most brands. And when these groups try us, our odds of repeat visits are much higher. These early insights give us confidence that new news are the more engaging marketing that we're beginning to see will allow us to drive transaction. Also, I'm pleased with the speed at which we're getting transaction-driving initiatives across digital, access, loyalty and menu into the test markets. \nThe combination of these test markets and early insights from consumer research will inform our plans in 2019 and beyond. \nBefore I turn it over to Jack, I want to thank all of our team members across the country that are working diligently to serve our guests real food cooked to perfection and prepared in our restaurants with fresh ingredients just the way our guests like it. This hard work is the basis for all of our future success, and we appreciate it tremendously. Now over to you, Jack.\nExecutives: Thanks, Brian. Really pleased that our team's focus on our 5 strategic priorities has contributed to a high-quality quarter with comp sales of 3.3% and a 19.7% restaurant-level margin. And underlying earnings were also strong after adjusting for a number of unusual costs during the quarter. As we discussed on our call last month, we'll continue to see because over the next few quarters associated with our restructuring, relocation and underperforming store closures. These charges also have temporary impact on our tax rates, which I'll talk about in more detail later. \nWe generated revenue of $1.27 billion during the quarter, an increase of 8.3% from last year on comp sales growth of 3.3%. That's on top of last year strong 8.1% Q2 comp sales increase. \nRestaurant-level margins of 19.7% expanded 90 basis points from last year, and normalized earnings per share adjusted for the unusual items was $2.87. \nThe second quarter had unusual expenses mostly related to transformation, and that negatively impacted EPS by about $1.19, leading to a GAAP earnings per share of $1.68. In Q2, we expensed about $25 million in expenses related to restaurant asset write-offs, approximately $16.5 million related to office closures and $7 million related to the restructure of our organization and other unusual expenses. These charges were offset by a nonrecurring benefit of about $6.5 million related to lower stock comp expense as a result of the restructure. As a result of these transformation expenses, our tax rate increased about 400 basis points, which I'll explain later. \nThe Q2 comp at 3.3% was primarily driven by higher average check due to the pricing increases taken over the last year as well as add-ons. Price increase averaged about 4% in the quarter, and customer resistance to the price increase remains at or below 20%. \nThe menu price impact was lower than Q1 as we lapped the first increase from April of last year in about 20% of our restaurants. Sales trends in the first 3 weeks of July continue to mirror what we saw in Q2 with the company increasing over the last week or so as we begun to compare against those softer trends from last year. \nSo overall, comps should improve from the 3.3% in Q2. However, keep in mind that comparisons will get tougher later in Q3 as we lap the introduction of queso in early September, which initially added about 3.5% to the comp before settling into a sustained benefit to the average check of about 2%. And in November, we lap the price increase in about 1,000 restaurants, which added an additional 1.3% prorated impact to the comp. \nBased on second quarter results and expected improvement in the Q3 comp, we're increasing our full year comp sales guidance from low single digits to a low to mid-single digit comp range. \nWe opened 34 new restaurants in the quarter and expect to be at the lower end of our 130 to 150 new opening guidance for the full year. While we're still inventory for next year's openings, we continue to expect 2019 openings will be at or above the 2018 levels. \nOur new restaurants this year have opened strong, and we're continuing to emphasize how high-quality, high-return new restaurants as we build out our pipeline. \nAs mentioned on our last call, we expect to close between 55 and 65 underperforming restaurants. And today, we're closing 29 Chipotle restaurants. \nDuring the second quarter, we closed 5 Pizzeria Locales in Kansas and Ohio, and we also closed 3 Chipotle restaurants, including one relocation. So today's closures about half of the underperforming restaurants have now closed. \nFood cost for the quarter were 32.6%, a decrease of 150 basis points from the 34.1% in Q2 of last year. The decrease from last year was driven by the menu price increase and more favorable avocado prices. The decreases were slightly offset by elevated prices for our stake in barbacoa. We expect food cost increase to the low 33% range in Q3 due to the seasonal shift to source higher cost avocados from California and an uptick in paper and packaging costs. We expect to be closer to the 33% in Q4 as we begin to shift the supply of avocados back to Mexico. \nLabor cost for the quarter were 27%, an increase of 80 basis points from the 26.2% in Q2 of last year. The increase from last year was driven primarily from wage inflation of about 6% and increased restaurant manager bonus cost as we returned to normalize bonus payouts, rewarding our managers for delivering strong results. \nThese increases were offset by leverage from the menu price increase. We expect labor cost to increase to the high 27% range in Q3 and in the mid-28% range in Q4, and these increases are driven primarily by seasonal lower sales in Q3 and Q4 and by general wage pressures. \nOccupancy cost for the quarter were 6.9%, which is flat with last year. Other operating cost for the quarter were 13.8%, a decrease of 20 basis points from Q2 of last year. \nOur marketing and promo costs were 3.2% in the quarter, a decrease of about 40 basis points compared to Q2 of last year. We expect marketing and promo costs to be at or slightly above 3% of sales for the full year, with elevated spending continuing in Q3 and Q4. \nOther operating costs continue to include about 30 basis points of higher maintenance and repair costs, which we first discussed on our Q4 call, and we expect M&R to continue at this elevated level for the rest of the year. \nG&A in the quarter increased by $8 million compared to Q1 of this year. The increase compared to last quarter was primarily due to the stock comp forfeitures and the timing of the 2018 equity grant that we discussed on the last earnings call. \nAnd as I mentioned earlier, G&A also included $7 million in charges related to the restructuring and additional unusual charges in the quarter, but those were offset by a $6.5 million nonrecurring benefit related to revising our estimates of forfeitures related to stock grants for employees expected to leave the company. \nThe G&A increase compared to Q2 of last year was primarily in support of our restaurant growth, digitizing our restaurant experience and operational leadership changes in the field. \nDepreciation expense for the quarter was 3.9%, an increase of 40 basis points from the 3.5% in Q2 of last year. This increase is due to the accelerated depreciation for items we're replacing related to the maintenance and repair refresh as well as capital initiatives that we described on our Q4 call. We expect the increase related to the refresh to fall off in the second half of the year. \nHowever, it will be replaced by accelerated depreciation and restaurant closures we told earlier. As a result, we expect depreciation to remain at this elevated level for the rest of this year. \nOur pretax income was $70 million, and our recorded effective tax rate was 33.3%. Our tax rate was higher than the 29% underlying rate we discussed on our last earnings call and is a direct result of the $42 million in unusual expenses this quarter. \nWithout these charges, our tax rate would have been right around a 28.5% effective rate, and we expect to return to a roughly 29% rate next year when the transformation charges are fully behind us. This underlying rate of about 29% may be affected in future use by stock comp vesting and exercises when the benefit realized by our employees varies from our accounting treatment, and we'll fully call out these impacts as they occur. \nWe continue to expect the transformation cost on the restructuring, restaurant closures and other unusual costs will total between $115 million and $135 million, with most of that amount hitting in [ 2018 ]. We estimate that about $50 million to $55 million will hit in Q3, with most of the remainder in Q4. There will likely be some charges related to terminating restaurant and office leases that will spill into 2019. \nWe'll also write off about $10 million in deferred tax assets beginning in Q4, with most hitting in 2019 as fully vested but underwater options will likely expire as we complete the restructure of the organization. \nIn Q3, we expect our effective tax rate to be right around 30.3% or about 130 basis points higher than we guided last quarter. In Q4, we expect our tax rate to be as high as 43% or about 450 basis points higher than we guided last quarter. Both of these increases are due to a lower pretax income as a result of the transformation expenses. \nAs mentioned during our Q1 call, our Q4 rate is impacted by a performance share that will likely expire in that period because the performance shares will only vest if the stock price is over $700. We took deductions of these performance shares over the years. But if they prove worthless, we won't get a tax benefit contributing to the estimated 43% tax rate. \nWe'll continue to provide more specifics on future transformation-related costs when we have more certainty around the timing, and we will continue to break out the unusual costs for normal cost you can follow the underlying trends. \nWe're encouraged by our second quarter results and the contributions of our restaurant teams have delivered an excellent guest experience. We're also encouraged by our guest response to our digital initiative so far along with a solid sales and restaurant-level margin performance during the quarter. We're confident that significant changes we're making to our organization will enable us to continue to improve operational excellence in our restaurants to be more nimble and innovative in digital, access, menu and the restaurant environment and to execute better to deliver on our commitments to our guests, our employees and our shareholders. And now we're happy to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Sara Senatore with Bernstein.\nAnalysts: Yes. Just on the 2Q, the implication is with 4 points of price, I think, that you saw some negative traffic, and I guess how do you turn that around? And in particular, you talked about really a lot of growth in digital usage. But do you think you're substituting -- just substituting from walk-in orders? Or can you actually tell that these orders are incremental? And are you starting to build a database of your customers that might allow for better targeted marketing?\nExecutives: Yes. Thanks for the question. Obviously, I think I made mention in the early remarks a lot of our new transaction-driving initiatives are getting ready to head to pilot, and we also are working on some new marketing communication as well. So I think as those things start to enter markets and then we gain learnings on how to improve those programs and then plan for national execution, the goal is to use the stage gate process than to inform what our sales and transaction performance can be going forward. The good news is our price increase that we passed through has passed nicely. We're not seeing customer accounts retreat versus anything we've seen historically when we take pricing. I mean, regarding your question on digital sales, obviously, there's multiple elements to that, right? There's the delivery aspect. There's our catering, and then's there's also the app or website orders. And we see varying degrees of incrementality across each of those spaces. The thing that we do know though is that when we get individual orders of that second make-line, the economics of that order are very attractive, and then our customer satisfaction scores also are very attractive. So we continue to see improvements on accuracy and speed at which we're giving people the food they want when they want, where they want it. So still a lot to learn, and actually, when we did the pilot going on our loyalty program, I think that's going to give us another level of insight and understanding on exactly how all these transactions are interacting with each other, and that's the new skill we're going to be building for the organization going forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Tarantino.\nAnalysts: Just maybe a clarification question on the comps for the quarter. Could you maybe explain how the trend transpired as the quarter progressed? It's not as if on the last call, you might have started a little slow and then may be picked up later in the quarter. But is that accurate? Or how should we think about that?\nExecutives: Yes, David. I think that is accurate. We talked on the last call that in April because of the weather and the seasonal shift of Easter that we got off to a slow start. May was a great month for us. That's when we had the [indiscernible] promotion. So May looked great, and I do settled in right at about the overall average for the month. So I would say the overall comp of 3 3 is a good kind of gauge for what the underlying trend was, a little less in April, more in May but then we settled out right in the middle of June. And so we feel good about the way that we ended the quarter and how we're entering the third quarter now.\nAnalysts: Great. That's helpful. And then, I guess, Jack or Brian, that does suggest a little bit of underlying improvement in at least the way we look at the business on a sequential basis on traffic. So could you maybe talk about what you think drove that improvement, whether it was the operations improvements you talked about? And then on the operations improvement in particular, is there any sort of deeper look at that data that would suggest that move in the needle as you kind of flip the restaurants that are doing the best from the worst apart from one another?\nExecutives: Yes. Look, I don't think it was just one thing. The good news is though as I've mentioned earlier, we've seen improvement in our operations on all the key metrics. And we continue to hear more and more positive customer feedback on their experiences and fewer or a reduction in customer complaints. And we believe there's even more opportunity for us to get even better on throughput going forward. So we're pleased with the progress. We're making laps. We also saw in the quarter people really responded positively to the advertising that we put out there. And then obviously, we see very positive responses to varying elements of our digital program. So I think it was a combination of all things, not one thing that drove it, and that's what -- has us excited about how we're moving forward all the pilots across the business. We're making progress I think on ops. We're making progress on digital, and we're making progress on really understanding our customer base better. So that look, we get the brands the right message million with the right food at the right place with the right value, I think we'll continue to see improvement in our performance.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nicole Miller with Piper Jaffray.\nAnalysts: Culture of accountability. Could you talk a little bit more about maybe how it's changed to work in the store day-to-day? And how are you aligning that with incentives to have the employees make these changes?\nExecutives: Nicole, I think we missed the first part of your question. Could you just start from the beginning?\nAnalysts: Absolutely. So asking about the culture of accountability. And I thought it was helpful how you talked about how that translated to the customer engagement or improved guest satisfaction. So what I'm wondering specific from the employee perspective, in that store, how is it different to work there today than before? And what are the incentives that you have put in place to keep them aligned with your culture of accountability?\nExecutives: Yes. Thanks for the question. Obviously, one of the things that I think Scott's done a nice job in the field is the accountability is both on developing a great team as well as being accountable to providing a great experience for the customer. So I think you're starting to see our teams being more -- staffed correctly, engaged at another level than where they had been over the last couple years. And everybody has clarity on what their role is on the team, and I think we've talked about it in the past, but we've given everybody their kind of top 5 responsibilities, which then gives the team the ability to trust that each other's going to doing be doing what they need to do for them to be successful. And then to your question on incentives, yes, we've moved to some quarterly bonus programs, and we've seen that actually have a material impact on our employee satisfaction with when they make great progress, and they get rewarded much closer to when they have that success. So I think it's a combination really of making sure that we're holding ourselves accountable to great experience but also holding ourselves accountable to develop a great team and then obviously, rewarding them when they have successes.\nAnalysts: And then just a final question, when you think about the structural framework previously of a $2 million AUV translating loosely to a 20% store-level margin, you're doing that yet you have over 3 percentage points of marketing that is at least twice as much as what it had been historically. So it seems that there might be more leverage in the model. Is there any kind of framework you could give or update for us to think about as we model going forward?\nExecutives: Yes, Nicole. We've also got, M&R is also high as well. I mean, the results we're seeing in the last couple of quarters give us even more confidence that the model at $2 million gets you right about in that high teens to 20% margin. And as we grow the volume from there we think we can move back up into the 20-plus percent margin. So the things that we about to do, I think we're starting to see that they're coming to life.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets.\nAnalysts: Brian, you mentioned some statistics earlier about how the fast-casual location perhaps overlaps with that of fast food in some ways with younger generations, and that trial seems to be important to these consumers. I'm trying to understand what you're seeing and saying about the opportunity there in the past. I think Chipotle tried to get trial going coupons and the like with this understanding that if you get trial, they'll come back, but how are you thinking about marketing perhaps different than that and using the data you're seeing?\nExecutives: Sure. Yes. So I think I mentioned this in our call a couple weeks ago. We've got a big foundational consumer study out, and we're starting to get some top line in. And what we have definitely seen us when people try the brand and have a positive experience with it, their intent to stay with the brand is much higher than a lot of our competitors in both fast-casual as well as fast food. And it's very exciting because when we look at younger people, we're getting even more positive response to intent and then intent to stick with us. So that's about what I was referencing. And in the brand obviously, I think we all instinctually see this is very much a purpose-driven brand that syncs up nicely with Gens E and millennials, and we're seeing that play out in our research as well. So we're going to want to continue to build on that train as we move forward.\nAnalysts: And Jack, you mentioned the restructuring expense that you expect. I know it's not typical necessarily in the sector, but could you talk about the dollar savings you anticipate or maybe the return on investment from these store closures and restructuring expenses and the timing of that? Any color would be helpful.\nExecutives: Yes, David. The restaurants we're closing, these are all cash flow-losing restaurants. We've got about half of them closed right now. So kind of take before we can see the full effect, we're going to have them all closed. But we should pick up somewhere in the 20, 30 basis points of margin once they're all closed. So there's a definite improvement in our margin returns from that standpoint. Most of the other costs, that's more with restructuring the organization. They're going to be returned on that. It's not going to be as black and white or linear. The return is going to be on having a culture that's more innovative, a culture that's more results-oriented, and we think there's going to be lots and lots of benefit there, but it's going to be less of a cause and effect where we can tell you what the actual return is.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Karen Holthouse with Goldman Sachs.\nAnalysts: This is actually Jared on for Karen. Can you guys give us a sense of maybe delivery as a percent of your total sales at this point, and maybe to some context about how delivery's contributing to stronger comp in 2Q versus 3Q?\nExecutives: Yes, delivery is a piece of that 10% number that I mentioned earlier on our digital sales, and what we're seeing is today, we're in 1,700 restaurants. We'll be expanding closer to 2,000 here shortly. Really, the delivery performance not surprising right now, what we're seeing is it really is impacted by how we promote it because we're in the early days of getting people to understand that it's available. I think at the last number I saw, we still have over 50% of customers not realizing Chipotle is available for delivery. So we're seeing some variability in the delivery performance based on how we promote with these partners. The thing that is exciting though is we are seeing when we hit that bump, we don't fall below where we were. So we're continuing to see progress. We think over time as we build awareness, build a habit, I think we'll see this play a bigger and bigger role in getting us into on-premise engagement.\nAnalysts: And if I can follow up with one more. Have you guys seen any learnings early on the new menu test items that you have in test right now?\nExecutives: Sure. I think I mentioned this earlier. We're actually -- you've seen the products in our NEXT Kitchen where that's really just the look of operational execution, and we're just getting ready to use our stage gate process to move a handful of initiatives into an actual test market, where we'll be at scale, where we'll start to really have true learnings of customer experience, team member experience and then how that plays out on total Chipotle performance. So too early to comment on any of those items right now.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andy Barish with Jefferies.\nAnalysts: Two things. Just on -- can you help us understand as you start to lap I think you mentioned, Jack, the July issues last year in Virginia just how we should think about that maybe 500 or 600 basis points decline in traffic kind of coming back.\nExecutives: Yes. There's a couple things going on right now. We're also comparing against, right now, SAVOR.WAVS. So we did see a nice uptick in a comp in the last week or so as we compare it to the soft tail from last year, but SAVOR.WAVS happened as well, which there's a big. A lot of buy one, get one, and so that's creating a bit of noise, but we do expect to see much more attractive traffic and much more attractive sales comps over the next several weeks. And that'll only be slowed a bit as we compare to the launch of last year, which I talked about in my prepared comments. So yes, we're already seeing the positive effect from the comparison to last year, to the softness from last year.\nAnalysts: Got you. And then anything on sort of pricing as you do the research on the brand, the ability to be a more regular menu price increase taker instead of every several years as has been the case in the past?\nExecutives: Yes. So one of the things we're definitely looking to understand is exactly the health for value creation. The good news is our value continues to be very strong, and what we're assessing right now is what is the right approach to sequencing pricing over time, making sure we don't ever get ahead of a great value equation. So that's part of the things research, frankly, that we got going on right now. As we did those learnings back, we will inform how we approach pricing going forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays.\nAnalysts: This is actually Jeff on for Jeff Bernstein. Operationally, given all these initiatives, including your potential new items coming from the NEXT Kitchen, and I know in New York, some of the pickup shelves around the end of your actual make-line, is there going to be an issue down the line where implementing some of these initiatives where you need to expand the line or reorganize it to get some of these things out there? And then I have one follow-up.\nExecutives: Yes. Sure. So I think I mentioned this before. Obviously, everything we're looking at has to be thoughtfully executed, so that the throughput engine of Chipotle is not jeopardized, and I think I mentioned this earlier. There's some projects that, frankly, just are bolt ons. So like a digital shelf pickup. That actually improves the customer experience and the team member experience because it illuminates that confusion for where the mobile order person is supposed to go, that awkward moment at the cashier. It eliminates a lot of that. So that, in our opinion, is a enabler because 2 things happen. One, it merchandises the fact that you can do this mobile ordering and not have to go through the line, and then the second piece is it really takes advantage of our second make-line, which is I think a huge advantage to open up an off-premise business. But look, the varying initiatives if it comes with needs for new equipment, we'll test out the new equipment and make sure that it works and plays nicely with the engine that we have. If it doesn't, then that's why we need the stage gate process to learn and figure out how we try again. And it's going to be a process with us. So I'm very excited that we're going to start the process of seeing some of these pilots get into market, so that we protect the integrity what's made Chipotle great while we figure out how relevance and dial up engagement.\nAnalysts: Great. And then on delivery, can you give us a sense of the average check you're seeing relative to your dining customer and then as well as the number of customers per order, the number of entrées per order however you want to approach it?\nExecutives: Yes, we see, obviously, a nice increase in our digital orders. So the mobile and delivery orders are in that $16 to $17 range versus our traditional check in the $12 range, and we're still learning, frankly, what is the order size that comes with it versus additional initial attachments like kitchen block in case and so on and so forth, but we really think right now of both there are times we see more add-ons, and there are time where clearly it's a larger group occasion that's off-premise that's ordering through the app or through the delivery third party.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.\nAnalysts: This Brandon on for John. I believe on the first quarter call, you mentioned that you expect marketing to be elevated throughout the remainder of the year. do You expect that to play out throughout the back half of '18 here?\nExecutives: Yes, we were -- it will be a little elevated. We were light in the first quarter. We were 3.2%. This past quarter, we'll be right at about that same 3.2%. So overall for the year, we'll average right at about 3% for the overall year.\nAnalysts: Got it, okay. And then I just had a follow up. You mentioned in your prepared remarks restaurant AB and guest scores are beginning to trend in the right direction. Can you elaborate on that comment? Maybe quantify some of those improvements?\nExecutives: Yes. So the restaurant AB is a measurement tool that we use that's a couple of metrics that are very important to us that cover financials, people, guest experience and the team, okay? And look, we're happy to see is we're seeing a nice move from Bs to As, and that's a good sign. So it's a very important metric. It's one that Scott keeps a laser eye on, and it's a good way for us to understand how we're performing in a restaurant and how we're actually making progress.\nOperator: Our final question comes from the line of Jake Bartlett with SunTrust.\nAnalysts: Great. First, I just want to get a sense for how much of the initiatives are driving or how much did the improved outlook in the back half was driven by the initiatives or driven by the easy to compares? And I know in terms of the initiatives, there's a lot of unknown timing, but maybe if you could talk about what you do know. For instance, I believe when you get your study back in the consumer that's going to be the source of a new advertising campaign, maybe some impact of the change in the new catering menu? I'm thinking about the shelf rollout. You just mentioned how kind of no-brainer it is. I mean, is that really a test that's going on? Or is that just kind of should we expect that to roll out here in the back half?\nExecutives: I didn't hear the last part of your question, but let me answer the first part, which is as we talked about our guidance, it's got very -- it's got nearly 0 on the initiatives that we've been talking about that we are putting into pilot and that we're going to start expanding over the course of the year. So -- and what we're seeing right now, I think is what I mentioned earlier, which I think we're seeing a nice improvement in our operational performance. I think we've got more visible, more effective, more relevant marketing out there, and I think we've done a nice job of expanding access to our digital efforts. I think it's going to continue to be the combination of all those things plus as we get some learning on loyalty and potentially some new menus items down the road that we'll see initiatives play hopefully a bigger role going forward. But as of right now, there's -- I think it's very minimal. And what was the second part of your question?\nAnalysts: The second part was just your initiative like the digital shelves, the pickup shelves. You mentioned a kind of it's a no-brainer operationally. I mean, what is the optimal can you just kind of rolling that out and not considering the test but kind of just seeing a roll out. What is there to test with them?\nExecutives: Yes. So look, I think as an organization, we're going to be a test-and-learn organization before we go launch. And even though going into where we put in these 5 stores, our early indication is it's a no-brainer. The good news is in the first 5 stores, it went as we hoped. And as a result, we're expanding now to 4, 5 markets in virtual order and the goal is assuming we continue to see the positive performance. We'll get it across the system very shortly thereafter.\nAnalysts: Right, great. And Jack, a clarification on the tax guidance. I'm just looking if I think about adjusted earnings and comparable to the 2 87 that you mentioned today, I look at the adjusted tax rate there, and it's 28.5% is my estimate. So when you think about the third quarter effective tax rate that you've mentioned in the fourth quarter, is that more relevant to GAAP earnings? Or is that relevant to the adjusted earnings we might be focused on?\nExecutives: Those rates are more GAAP earnings. The underlying rates are going to be more similar to what we talked about on our last call. So the higher tax rate that you're seeing this time compared to what we talked about on our first quarter call are directly attributable to the fact that we've got all these charges. It's just pushing our income down, and so it ends up pushing our rates up. When we normalize our earnings like, for example, in this quarter, our normal tax rate would be at that 28.5% range.\nAnalysts: Got it. And then last question just because I think there is some confusion around depreciation as I look at different estimates fairly wide range. Could you help us understand what is accelerated depreciation in 2018 and will not going to occur in '19? And maybe whether you think that depreciation as a whole would be potentially less in '19 than the '18 overall.\nExecutives: Yes, '19 will definitely be less. We're at a higher level this year. Let's call it 30 basis points or so. That's due to 2 things. One is due to retiring assets as a result of our refresh. We're investing in operating our restaurant. So that requires accelerated depreciation on the items that are going to be taken out of the restaurant. And then secondly, part of the restaurant that haven't closed yet, we leave a little bit on the books. GAAP requires that you leave a little bit of the asset on the books, and then you right that off over the remaining time that you expect to have restaurants to be open. And so as the M&R that we're doing, the refresh that we're doing, as that depreciation levels off, that'll be replaced by this higher depreciation from the stores that we're going to close but that should fall off. Most of it should fall off this year, maybe in early next year, and then our depreciation should go to more than normal historical rates.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of our question-and-answer session, and I would like to turn the call back over to Chipotle CEO, Brian Niccol, for closing remarks.\nExecutives: Okay. Well, thank you, everybody. I know this is a busy earnings time. So I appreciate everybody taking the time to listen to our results and have a discussion of the business. And thanks again, and I'm sure we'll be in touch. Take care.\nOperator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.\nOperator: Greetings, and welcome to Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Chipotle. Please go ahead.\nExecutives: Hi, everyone, and welcome to our call today. By now, you should have access to our earnings announcement released this afternoon for the second quarter of 2018.\nIt may also be found on our Investor Relations website at ir.chipotle.com.\nBefore we begin our presentation, I will remind everyone that parts of our discussion today will include forward-looking statements as defined in the securities laws.\nThese forward-looking statements will include statements regarding the expected benefits from our strategic focus areas or specific business initiatives; the potential opportunity for our digital sales; sales trends and forecasts for future comparable sales; expected new restaurant openings; estimates of future food, labor, marketing and maintenance and repair costs; statements about our expected effective tax rate and projections of the amount and timing of unusual cost items and stock repurchases as well as other statements of our expectations and plans.\nThese statements are based on information available to us today, and we are not assuming any obligation to update them.\nForward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.\nWe refer you to the risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K as updated and our subsequent Form 10-Qs for a discussion of these risks.\nOur discussion today will also include non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations of which can be found on the Presentation page of the Investor Relations section of our website. I'd also like to remind everyone that we've adopted a self-imposed quiet period, restricting communications with investors during that period.\nThe quiet period will begin on the 16th day of the last month of each fiscal quarter and continues until the next earnings conference call.\nFor the third quarter of 2018, it will begin September 16 and continue through our third quarter earnings release.\nWe will start today's call with some prepared remarks from Brian Niccol, Chief Executive Officer; and Jack Hartung, Chief Financial Officer. After which, we will take questions. In the room and also available during the Q&A period are Scott Boatwright, Chief Restaurant Officer; Curt Garner, Chief Digital and Information Officer; Chris Brandt, Chief Marketing Officer; Laurie Schalow, Chief Communications Officer; and Marissa Andrada, Chief Human Resources Officer. \nAnd now, I will turn the call over to Brian Niccol.\nExecutives: Thanks, Coralie, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report a solid second quarter with sales and restaurant-level margins ahead of our expectations. \nTotal sales grew 8.3% to $1.27 billion, driven by comparable sales of 3.3% and 34 new restaurants opened in the quarter. This positive comparable sales trajectory enabled us to expand restaurant-level margins, which were up 90 basis points year-over-year to 19.7%. Earnings per share adjusted for unusual costs grew nearly 24% to $2.87, and our GAAP earnings were $1.68. \nWhile Jack will go through the financials in more detail shortly, I'd like to put these results into context by discussing how the work our 70,000 employees do every day contributed to these financial outcomes. \nLast month, we shared with you that we would execute our strategy to win today and cultivate the future by focusing on these 5 areas: becoming a more culturally relevant and engaging brand that builds love and loyalty; digitizing and modernizing our restaurant experience to create a more convenient and enjoyable guest experience; running great restaurants with great hospitality and throughput; being disciplined and focused to enhance our powerful economic model; and building a great culture that can innovate and execute across digital, access, menu and the restaurant experience. \nToday, I'll focus on how innovation in digital and access and how improving our operations contributed to this quarter's results. Let me begin with operations. \nWe know that strong sales growth and margins are dependent on great operations, which is the hallmark of any healthy brand. This brand was founded on outstanding operations and real food. We are getting back to our roots. When we have the right people leading the right teams and when those teams are well trained and operating with confidence, they execute great guest experiences. \nIt takes time to build a culture of accountability, and I'm pleased that we are seeing some encouraging signs of progress in key areas, namely, our restaurant AV scores, a measurement system we implemented 1.5 years ago to drive greater accountability, is trending in the right direction. We are doing a better job staffing our restaurants to match sales volumes, and we have lower year-over-year hourly turnover, which tells us we are making progress on training and building great teams. \nAdditionally, we have seen a meaningful decline in guest complaints, and with that, our guest satisfaction scores have improved since we started measuring them last year. This tells us that we've made progress and that our guests are noticing the difference. We know that when the food is delicious, the feel of the restaurant is great, and we removed the friction from the flow of the order process, no matter the channel, we delight customers.\nWhile I'm encouraged by our progress, we still have a lot of work to do. We have an opportunity to improve throughput, consistent execution of great food and consistent delivery of a great atmosphere. I'll outline some of the initiatives underway to address those opportunities. We are halfway through our big fix initiative, which is designed to bring our restaurants back up to standards and make them uniquely Chipotle. This not only improves the guest experience as the appearance of our restaurant is clean and well maintained for every guest, but the team member experience improves as well. \nWe overhauled our training material several months ago and have retrained 3/4 of our field leaders through Cultivate University. That's an in-restaurant and in-classroom 1-week training session that we launched in April. That investment in the ongoing development of our field leadership continue to drive crew member engagement. We're supplementing that training with a new hospitality training program in the restaurants, and we're in the early innings of refining our training to teach and taste the details, so that we achieve the winning combination of great food, feel and flow with every guest experience. \nWe are zeroing in on how to get back to great throughput as speed of service is a foundational element of convenience that our guests truly value. Late last year, we rolled out what we call the owner's path, a comprehensive review of our restaurant's performance. Equipping our field leaders with this tool is improving their powers of observation and allowing them to focus on the critical details of delivering improved guest experience. In addition, the tool creates teaching moments for their general managers and documents that corrective actions are taken when needed. We're currently rolling out a digital version for mobile phones and tablets of this previous paper-based tool. That should result in more consistent operations across our restaurants. We'll have this in place nationally by October. \nWe're also in the process of redesigning our forecasting and labor scheduling tool. This is a significant undertaking but necessary for us to have accurate sales forecasting and deliver the right amount of labor at the right time to meet the needs of our guests. \nThe new tool will have a best-in-class sales forecasting component that will leverage machine learning to remove the guesswork of determining sales and labor needs for our business. In addition, our team members will have the ability to see their schedules remotely and swap shifts through mobile phones, taking these tasks out of the hands of the manager. We believe leveraging technologies such as this makes us a more desirable employer as we work to create a better experience for our crew members. We will continue to make investments in our restaurants because a better experience for our team members directly translates to a better experience for our guests. \nI'd also like to talk to you about the progress we are making around innovation in digital and access, as this was a real bright spot in the quarter. Today, our annualized digital sales are approximately $0.5 billion, and we're in the early stages of this multibillion-dollar opportunity. Our digital sales grew 33% in the quarter and now account for 10.3% of sales, an acceleration from 20% growth in the first quarter. \nWe now have 4 million active monthly users across our app and our website, a 65% increase since the end of last year. Delivering group occasions were particularly strong this quarter. Delivery sales quadrupled in the quarter and we know from our customer research that improving access to Chipotle is an important growth lever, whether it be through adding more restaurants or enabling more convenience like delivery. \nToday, delivery is available from 1,700 restaurants and we expect that to reach 2,000 restaurants by year-end. We're also pleased that delivery is now an option available directly from our app. \nOur group ordering business was solid in the seasonally strong quarter for catering orders. In mid-July, we expanded our billed room catering offer nationally, whereby we lowered the minimum size and offered more price tiers for group orders. Therefore, expanding access for more occasions. We tested this enhancement early in the year and found that group order sales in our test stores outperformed the base by mid to high single digits. \nDelivery availability for catering expanded to 2/3 of our restaurants in the quarter. As I've mentioned, Chipotle's second make-line enables the business to handle the incremental growth without any impact on throughput or the in-restaurant experience. I'm happy to see progress on digitizing our second make-lines, which are now in roughly 500 restaurants. We're targeting approximately 1,000 restaurants to be enabled with the digital second make-line by year-end, and we are accelerating our rollout to reach completion by the end of 2019. \nThese digital second make-lines have a direct positive impact on the team member and guest experience. Also, the digital pickup shelf test in several New York City restaurants continues to show great promise. And based on the results to date, we will be expanding the test to a larger number of restaurants in several markets next month. \nWe've mentioned before that we are undertaking a wide-ranging consumer research project, with the results available this fall. I did, however, want to mention a few interesting highlights that we've uncovered so far. Access is the #1 lever we can pull to drive sales, which supports our new unit growth as well as the innovation focus around the access via our digital channels. Additionally, we're sitting in an interesting intersection between fast food and fast casual, with many attributes such as value and speed that are typically associated with fast food and attributes such as quality and freshness, which are typically associated with fast-casual. \nWe're particularly strong with millennial and Generation Z customers relative to most brands. And when these groups try us, our odds of repeat visits are much higher. These early insights give us confidence that new news and the more engaging marketing that we're beginning to see will allow us to drive transaction growth. Also, I'm pleased with the speed at which we're getting transaction-driving initiatives across digital, access, loyalty and menu into test markets. \nThe combination of these test markets and early insights from consumer research will inform our plans in 2019 and beyond. \nBefore I turn it over to Jack, I want to thank all of our team members across the country that are working diligently to serve our guests real food, cooked to perfection and prepared in our restaurants with fresh ingredients, just the way our guests like it. This hard work is the basis for all of our future success, and we appreciate it tremendously. Now over to you, Jack.\nExecutives: Thanks, Brian. I'm really pleased that our team's focus on our 5 strategic priorities has contributed to a high-quality quarter with comp sales of 3.3% and a 19.7% restaurant-level margin. And underlying earnings were also strong after adjusting for a number of unusual costs during the quarter. As we discussed on our call last month, we'll continue to see cost over the next few quarters associated with our restructuring, relocation and underperforming store closures. These charges also have a temporary impact on our tax rates, which I'll talk about in more detail later. \nWe generated revenue of $1.27 billion during the quarter, an increase of 8.3% from last year on comp sales growth of 3.3%. That's on top of last year's strong 8.1% Q2 comp sales increase. \nRestaurant-level margins of 19.7% expanded 90 basis points from last year, and normalized earnings per share adjusted for the unusual items was $2.87. \nThe second quarter had unusual expenses mostly related to the transformation, and that negatively impacted EPS by about $1.19, leading to a GAAP earnings per share of $1.68. In Q2, we expensed about $25 million in expenses related to restaurant asset write-offs, approximately $16.5 million related to office closures and $7 million related to the restructure of our organization and other unusual expenses. These charges were offset by a nonrecurring benefit of about $6.5 million related to lower stock comp expense as a result of the restructure. As a result of these transformation expenses, our tax rate increased about 400 basis points, which I'll explain later. \nThe Q2 comp at 3.3% was primarily driven by higher average checks due to the price increases taken over the last year as well as queso add-ons. Price increase averaged about 4% in the quarter, and customer resistance to the price increase remains at or below 20%. \nThe menu price impact was lower than Q1 as we lapped the first increase from April of last year in about 20% of our restaurants. Sales trends in the first 3 weeks of July continue to mirror what we saw in Q2, with the comp increasing over the last week or so as we begun to compare against those softer trends from last year. \nSo overall, comps should improve from the 3.3% in Q2. However, keep in mind that comparisons will get tougher later in Q3 as we lap the introduction of queso in early September, which initially added about 3.5% to the comp before settling into a sustained benefit to the average check of about 2%. And in November, we will lap the price increase in about 1,000 restaurants, which added an additional 1.3% prorated impact to the comp. \nBased on second quarter results and expected improvement in the Q3 comp, we're increasing our full year comp sales guidance from low single digits to a low to mid-single digit comp range. \nWe opened 34 new restaurants in the quarter and expect to be at the lower end of our 130 to 150 new opening guidance for the full year. While we're still building inventory for next year's openings, we continue to expect 2019 openings will be at or above the 2018 levels. \nOur new restaurants this year have opened strong, and we're continuing to emphasize high-quality, high-return new restaurants as we build out our pipeline. \nAs mentioned on our last call, we expect to close between 55 and 65 underperforming restaurants. And today, we're closing 29 Chipotle restaurants. \nDuring the second quarter, we closed 5 Pizzeria Locales in Kansas and Ohio, and we also closed 3 Chipotle restaurants, including one relocation. So today's closure is about half of the underperforming restaurants have now closed. \nFood cost for the quarter were 32.6%, a decrease of 150 basis points from the 34.1% in Q2 of last year. The decrease from last year was driven by the menu price increase and more favorable avocado prices. The decreases were slightly offset by elevated prices for our steak and barbacoa. We expect food cost increase to the low 33% range in Q3 due to the seasonal shift to source higher cost avocados from California and an uptick in paper and packaging costs. We expect to be closer to the 33% in Q4 as we begin to shift the supply of avocados back to Mexico. \nLabor cost for the quarter were 27%, an increase of 80 basis points from the 26.2% in Q2 of last year. The increase from last year was driven primarily from wage inflation of about 6% and increased restaurant manager bonus costs as we returned to normalized bonus payouts, rewarding our managers for delivering strong results. \nThese increases were offset by leverage from the menu price increase. We expect labor cost to increase to the high 27% range in Q3 and in the mid-28% range in Q4, and these increases are driven primarily by seasonally lower sales in Q3 and Q4 and by general wage pressures. \nOccupancy cost for the quarter were 6.9%, which is flat with last year. Other operating cost for the quarter were 13.8%, a decrease of 20 basis points from Q2 of last year. \nOur marketing and promo costs were 3.2% in the quarter, a decrease of about 40 basis points compared to Q2 of last year. We expect marketing and promo costs to be at or slightly above 3% of sales for the full year, with elevated spending continuing in Q3 and Q4. \nOther operating costs continue to include about 30 basis points of higher maintenance and repair costs, which we first discussed on our Q4 call, and we expect M&R to continue at this elevated level for the rest of the year. \nG&A in the quarter increased by $8 million compared to Q1 of this year. The increase compared to last quarter was primarily due to the stock comp forfeitures and the timing of the 2018 equity grant that we discussed on the last earnings call. \nAnd as I mentioned earlier, G&A also included $7 million in charges related to the restructuring and additional unusual charges in the quarter, but those were offset by a $6.5 million nonrecurring benefit related to revising our estimates of forfeitures related to stock grants for employees expected to leave the company. \nThe G&A increase compared to Q2 of last year was primarily in support of our restaurant growth, digitizing our restaurant experience and operational leadership changes in the field. \nDepreciation expense for the quarter was 3.9%, an increase of 40 basis points from the 3.5% in Q2 of last year. This increase is due to the accelerated depreciation for items we're replacing related to the maintenance and repair refresh as well as capital initiatives that we described on our Q4 call. We expect the increase related to the refresh to fall off in the second half of the year. \nHowever, it will be replaced by accelerated depreciation and the restaurant closures we detailed earlier. As a result, we expect depreciation to remain at this elevated level for the rest of this year. \nOur pretax income was $70 million and our reported effective tax rate was 33.3%. Our tax rate was higher than the 29% underlying rate we discussed on our last earnings call and is a direct result of the $42 million in unusual expenses this quarter. \nWithout these charges, our tax rate would have been right around a 28.5% effective rate, and we expect to return to a roughly 29% rate next year when the transformation charges are fully behind us. This underlying rate of about 29% may be affected in future years by stock comp vesting and exercises when the benefit realized by our employees varies from our accounting treatment, and we'll fully call out these impacts as they occur. \nWe continue to expect the transformation cost on the restructuring, restaurant closures and other unusual costs will total between $115 million and $135 million, with most of that amount hitting in 2018. We estimate that about $50 million to $55 million will hit in Q3, with most of the remainder in Q4. There will likely be some charges related to terminating restaurant and office leases that will spill into 2019. \nWe'll also write off about $10 million in deferred tax assets beginning in Q4, with most hitting in 2019 as fully vested but underwater options will likely expire as we complete the restructure of the organization. \nIn Q3, we expect our effective tax rate to be right around 30.3% or about 130 basis points higher than we guided last quarter. In Q4, we expect our tax rate to be as high as 43% or about 450 basis points higher than we guided last quarter. Both of these increases are due to a lower pretax income as a result of the transformation expenses. \nAs mentioned during our Q1 call, our Q4 rate is impacted by performance shares that will likely expire in that period because the performance shares will only vest if the stock price is over $700. We took deductions on these performance shares over the years but if they prove worthless, we won't get a tax benefit contributing to the estimated 43% tax rate. \nWe'll continue to provide more specifics on future transformation-related costs when we have more certainty around the timing, and we will continue to break out the unusual costs for normal cost so you can follow the underlying trends. \nWe're encouraged by our second quarter results and the contribution of our restaurant teams have delivered an excellent guest experience. We're also encouraged by our guest response to our digital initiative so far along with a solid sales and restaurant-level margin performance during the quarter. We're confident that significant changes we're making to our organization will enable us to continue to improve operational excellence in our restaurants, to be more nimble and innovative in digital, access, menu and the restaurant environment, and to execute better to deliver on our commitment to our guests, our employees and our shareholders. And now, we're happy to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Sara Senatore with Bernstein.\nAnalysts: Just on the 2Q, the implication is with 4 points of price, I think that you saw some negative traffic. And I guess, how do you turn that around? And in particular, you talked about really, a lot of growth in digital usage. But do you think you're substituting -- just substituting from walk-in orders or can you actually tell that these orders are incremental? And are you starting to build a database of your customers that might allow for better targeted marketing?\nExecutives: Yes. Thanks for the question. Obviously, I think I mentioned in the early remarks, a lot of our new transaction-driving initiatives are getting ready to head to pilot, and we also are working on some new marketing communication as well. So I think as those things start to enter markets and then we gain learnings on how to improve those programs and then plan for national execution, the goal is to use the stage gate process then to inform what our sales and transaction performance can be going forward. The good news is our price increase that we passed through has passed through nicely. We're not seeing customer accounts retreat versus anything we've seen historically when we take pricing. I mean, regarding your question on digital sales, obviously, there's multiple elements to that, right? There's the delivery aspect, there's our catering, and then there's also the app or website orders. And we see varying degrees of incrementality across each of those spaces. The thing that we do know though is when we get individual orders through that second make-line, the economics of that order are very attractive, and then our customer satisfaction scores also are very attractive. So we continue to see improvements on accuracy and speed at which we're giving people the food they want, when they want, where they want it. So still a lot to learn and actually, when we did the pilot going on our loyalty program, I think that's going to give us another level of insight and understanding on exactly how all these transactions are interacting with each other. And that's a new skill we're going to be building for the organization going forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Tarantino.\nAnalysts: Just maybe a clarification question on the comps for the quarter. Could you just maybe explain how the trend transpired as the quarter progressed? It's not as if on the last call, you might have started a little slow and then maybe picked up later in the quarter, but is that accurate? Or how should we think about that?\nExecutives: Yes, David. I think that is accurate. We talked on the last call that in April, because of weather and the seasonal shift of Easter, that we got off to a slow start. May was a great month for us, that's when we had the DoorDash promotion, so May looked great. And then June settled in right at about the overall average for the month. So I would say, the overall comp of 3.3% is a good kind of gauge for what the underlying trend was. A little less in April, more in May but then we settled out right in the middle in June. And so, we feel good about the way that we ended the quarter and how we're entering the third quarter now.\nAnalysts: Great. That's helpful. And then, I guess, Jack or Brian, that does suggest a little bit of underlying improvement in at least the way we look at the business on a sequential basis on traffic. So could you maybe talk about what you think drove that improvement, whether it was the operations improvements you talked about? And then on the operations improvement in particular, is there any sort of deeper look at that data that would suggest that move in the needle as you kind of flip the restaurants that are doing the best from the worst apart from one another?\nExecutives: Yes. Look, I don't think it was just one thing. The good news is though, as I've mentioned earlier, we've seen improvement in our operations on all the key metrics. And we continue to hear more and more positive customer feedback on their experiences and fewer -- or a reduction in customer complaints. And we believe there's even more opportunity for us to get even better on throughput going forward. So we're pleased with the progress we're making on apps. We also saw in the quarter, people really responded positively to the advertising that we put out there. And then obviously, we've seen very positive responses to varying elements of our digital program. So I think it was a combination of multiple things, not one thing that drove it. And that's what has us excited about how we're moving forward with all the pilots across the business. We're making progress I think on ops, we're making progress on digital, and we're making progress on really understanding our customer base better. So that once we get the brands the right message then with the right food at the right place with the right value, I think we'll continue to see improvement in our performance.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nicole Miller with Piper Jaffray.\nAnalysts: Culture of accountability. Could you talk a little bit more about maybe how it's changed to work in the store day-to-day? And how are you aligning that with incentives to have the employees make these changes?\nExecutives: Nicole, I think we missed the first part of your question. Could you just start from the beginning?\nAnalysts: Absolutely. So asking about the culture of accountability, and I thought it was helpful how you talked about how that translated to the customer engagement or improved guest satisfaction. So what I'm wondering is from the employee perspective, in that store, how is it different to work there today than before? And what are the incentives that you have put in place to keep them aligned with your culture of accountability?\nExecutives: Yes. Thanks for the question. Obviously, one of the things that I think Scott's done a nice job in the field is the accountability is both on developing a great team as well as being accountable to providing a great experience for the customer. So I think we're starting to see our teams being more staffed correctly, engaged at another level than where they had been over the last couple years, and everybody has clarity on what their role is on the team. And I think we've talked about this in the past, but we've given everybody their kind of top 5 responsibilities, which then gives the team the ability to trust that each other is going to doing be doing what they need to do for them to be successful. And then to your question on incentives, yes, we've moved to some quarterly bonus programs and we've seen that actually have a material impact on our employee satisfaction with when they make great progress then they get rewarded much closer to when they have that success. So I think it's a combination really of making sure that we're holding ourselves accountable to a great experience but also holding ourselves accountable to develop a great team and then obviously, rewarding them when they have successes.\nAnalysts: And then just a final question. When you think about the structural framework previously of a $2 million AUV translating loosely to a 20% store-level margin, you're doing that yet, you have over 3 percentage points of marketing that is at least twice as much as what it had been historically. So it seems that there might be more leverage in the model. Is there any kind of framework you could give or update for us to think about as we model going forward?\nExecutives: Nicole, we've also got M&R just a little high as well. So I mean, the results we're seeing in the last couple of quarters give us even more confidence that the model at $2 million gets you right about in that high teens to 20% margin. And as we grow the volume from there, we think we can move back up into the 20-plus percent margin. So the things that we thought the model can do, I think we're starting to see that they're coming to life.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets.\nAnalysts: Brian, you mentioned some statistics earlier about how the fast-casual occasion perhaps overlaps with that of fast food in some ways with younger generations, and that trial seems to be important with these consumers. I'm trying to understand what you're seeing and saying about the opportunity there. In the past, I think Chipotle tried to get trial going coupons and the like with this understanding that if you get trial, they'll come back. But how are you thinking about marketing perhaps different than that and using the data you're seeing?\nExecutives: Sure, yes. So I think I mentioned this in our call a couple weeks ago. We've got a big foundational consumer study out, and we're starting to get some top lines in. And what we have definitely seen is when people try the brand and have a positive experience with it, their intent to stay with the brand is much higher than a lot of our competitors in both fast-casual as well as fast food. And it's very exciting because when we look at younger people, we're getting even more positive response to intent and then intent to stick with us. So that's what I was referencing. And in the brand obviously, I think we all instinctually see this is very much a purpose-driven brand that syncs up nicely with Gen Z and millennials, and we're seeing that play out in our research as well. So we're going to want to continue to build on that strength as we move forward.\nAnalysts: And Jack, you mentioned the restructuring expense that you expect. I know it's not typical necessarily in the sector, but could you talk about the dollar savings you anticipate or maybe the return on investment from these store closures and restructuring expenses and the timing of that? Any color would be helpful.\nExecutives: Yes, David. On the restaurants we're closing, these are all cash flow-losing restaurants. We've got about half of them closed right now. So kind of take -- before we can see the full effect, we're going to have to have them all closed. But we should pick up somewhere in the 20, 30 basis points of margin once they're all closed. So there's a definite improvement in our margin returns from that standpoint. Most of the other costs, that's more with restructuring the organization. They're going to be returned on that. It's not going to be as black and white or linear. The return is going to be on having a culture that's more innovative, a culture that's more results-oriented. And we think there's going to be lots and lots of benefits there, but it's going to be less of a cause and effect where we can tell you what the actual return is.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Karen Holthouse with Goldman Sachs.\nAnalysts: This is actually Jared on for Karen. Can you guys give us a sense of maybe delivery as a percent of your total sales at this point, and maybe just some context about how delivery is contributing to the stronger comp in 2Q versus 3Q?\nExecutives: Yes, delivery is a piece of that 10% number that I mentioned earlier on our digital sales. And what we're seeing is today, we're in 1,700 restaurants, we'll be expanding closer to 2,000 here shortly. Really, the delivery performance, not surprising right now, what we're seeing is it really is impacted by how we promote it, because we're in the early days of getting people to understand that it's available. I think at the last number I saw, we still have over 50% of customers not realizing Chipotle is available for delivery. So we're seeing some variability in the delivery performance based on how we promote with these partners. The thing that is exciting though is we are seeing when we hit that bump, we don't fall below where we were. So we're continuing to see progress. And I think over time as we build awareness, build a habit, I think we'll see this play a bigger and bigger role in getting us into an off-premise occasion.\nAnalysts: And if I could just follow up with one more. Have you guys seen any learnings early on the new menu test items that you have in test right now?\nExecutives: Sure. I think I mentioned this earlier. We're actually -- you've seen the products in our NEXT Kitchen where that's really just for us to look at operational execution. And we're just getting ready to use our stage gate process to move a handful of initiatives into an actual test market, where we'll be at scale, where we'll start to really have true learnings of customer experience, team member experience and then how that plays out on total Chipotle performance. So too early to comment on any of those items right now.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andy Barish with Jefferies.\nAnalysts: Two things just on -- can you help us understand as you start to lap, I think you mentioned, Jack, the July issues last year in Virginia, just how we should think about that maybe 500 or 600 basis points decline in traffic kind of coming back.\nExecutives: Yes, Andy. There's a couple things going on right now. We're also comparing against, right now, SAVOR.WAVS. So we did see a nice uptick in a comp in the last week or so as we compare it to the soft tail from last year. But SAVOR.WAVS happened as well, which there's a big BOGO, a lot of buy one, get one. And so, that's creating a bit of noise but we do expect to see much more attractive traffic and much more attractive sales comps over the next several weeks. And that'll only be slowed a bit as we compare to the launch of queso last year, which I talked about in my prepared comments. So yes, we're already seeing the positive effect from the comparisons to last year, to the softness from last year.\nAnalysts: Got you. And then anything on sort of pricing as you do the research on the brand, the ability to be a more regular menu price increase taker instead of every several years as has been the case in the past?\nExecutives: Yes. So one of the things we're definitely looking to understand is exactly the health over value equation. The good news is, our value continues to be very strong and what we're assessing right now is what is the right approach to sequencing pricing over time, making sure we don't ever get ahead of a great value equation? So that's part of the consumer research, frankly, that we've got going on right now. As we did those learnings back, it we will inform how we approach pricing going forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays.\nAnalysts: This is actually Jeff Priester on for Jeff Bernstein. Operationally, given all these initiatives, including your potential new items coming from the NEXT Kitchen, and I know in New York, some of the pickup shelves around the end of your actual make-line, is there going to be an issue down the line where implementing some of these initiatives where you need to expand the line or reorganize it to get some of these things out there? And then I have one follow-up.\nExecutives: Yes, sure. So I think I've mentioned this before. Obviously, everything we're looking at has to be thoughtfully executed so that the throughput engine of Chipotle is not jeopardized. And I think I mentioned this earlier, there's some projects that frankly, just are bolt-ons. So like a digital shelf pickup, that actually improves the customer experience and the team member experience because it illuminates that confusion for where the mobile order person is supposed to go, that awkward moment at the cashier, it eliminates a lot of that. So that, in our opinion, is a throughput enabler because 2 things happen. One, it merchandises the fact that you can do this mobile ordering and not have to go through the line. And then the second piece is it really takes advantage of our second make-line, which is, I think, a huge advantage to open up an off-premise business. But look, the varying initiatives, if it comes with needs for new equipment, we'll test out the new equipment and make sure that it works and plays nicely with the throughput engine that we have. If it doesn't, then that's why we need the stage gate process to learn and figure out how we try again. And it's going to be an integral process with us, so I'm very excited that we're going to start the process of seeing some of these pilots get into market, so that we protect the integrity what's made Chipotle great while we figure out how we enhance relevance and dial up engagement.\nAnalysts: Great. And then on delivery, can you give us a sense of the average check you're seeing relative to your dining customer and then as well, the number of customers per order, the number of entrées per order, however you want to approach it?\nExecutives: Yes, I mean, we see obviously, a nice increase in our digital orders. So the mobile and delivery orders are in that $16 to $17 range versus our traditional check that's in the $12 range. And we're still learning, frankly, what is the order size that comes with it versus additional attachments like chips and guac and queso and so on and so forth. But we really think a blend right now, both there are times we see more add-ons and then there are times where clearly, it's a larger group occasion that's off-premise that's ordering through the app or through the delivery third party.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.\nAnalysts: This Brandon on for John. I believe on the first quarter call, you mentioned that you expected marketing and promo to be elevated throughout the remainder of the year. Do you still expect that to play out throughout the back half of '18 here?\nExecutives: Yes, we were -- it will be a little elevated. We were light in the first quarter, we were 3.2% this past quarter, and we'll be right at about that same 3.2%. So overall for the year, we'll average right at about 3% for the overall year.\nAnalysts: Got it, okay. And then I just had a follow up. You mentioned in your prepared remarks, the restaurant AV and guest scores are beginning to trend in the right direction. Could you elaborate on that comment and maybe quantify some of those improvements?\nExecutives: Yes. So the restaurant AV is the measurement tool that we use that's a couple of metrics that are very important to us that cover financials, people, guest experience and the team, okay? And what we're happy to see is we're seeing a nice move from Bs to As, and that's a good sign. So it's a very important metric, it's one that Scott keeps a laser eye on, and it's a good way for us to understand how we're performing in our restaurants and how we're actually making progress.\nOperator: Our final question comes from the line of Jake Bartlett with SunTrust.\nAnalysts: Great. First, I just want to get a sense for how much of the initiatives are driving or how much did the improved outlook in the back is was driven by the initiatives or driven by the easy to compares? And I know in terms of the initiatives, there's a lot of unknown timing but maybe if you could talk about what you do know. For instance, I believe when you get your study back in the consumer, that's going to be the source of a new advertising campaign, maybe some impact of the change in the new catering menu. I'm thinking about the shelf rollout. You just mentioned how kind of a no-brainer it is. I mean, is that really a test that's going on or is that just kind of a -- I mean, should we expect that to be rolled out here in the back half?\nExecutives: I didn't hear the last part of your question, but let me answer the first part, which is as we talked about our guidance, it's got very -- it's got nearly 0 on the initiatives that we've been talking about that we are putting into pilot and that we're going to start expanding over the course of the year. So what we're seeing right now, I think is what I mentioned earlier, which I think, we're seeing a nice improvement in our operational performance. I think we've got more visible, more effective, more relevant marketing out there, and I think we've done a nice job of expanding access to our digital efforts. I think it's going to continue to be the combination of all those things plus as we get some learning on loyalty and potentially some new menus items down the road, that we'll see initiatives play then hopefully, a bigger role going forward. But as of right now, there's -- I think it's very minimal. And what was the second part of your question?\nAnalysts: The second part was just your initiative like the digital -- like, the shelves, the pickup shelves. You mentioned a kind of it's a no-brainer operationally. I mean, what is the optimal if you're just kind of rolling that out and not considering the test but kind of just seeing a roll out. What is there to test with that?\nExecutives: Yes. So look, I think as an organization, we're going to be a test-and-learn organization before we go launch. And even though going into where we put in these 5 stores, our early indications were it's a no-brainer. The good news is in the first 5 stores, it went as we had hoped. And as a result, we're expanding now to 4, 5 markets in virtual order. And the goal is assuming we continue to see the positive performance, we'll get it across the system very shortly thereafter.\nAnalysts: Great. And Jack, a clarification on the tax guidance. I'm just looking, if I think about adjusted earnings and comparable to the 2.87% that you mentioned today, I look at the adjusted tax rate there, and it's 28.5% is my estimate. So when you think about the third quarter effective tax rate that you've mentioned in the fourth quarter, is that more relevant to GAAP earnings or is that relevant to the adjusted earnings where you might be focused on?\nExecutives: Those rates are more GAAP earnings. The underlying rates are going to be more similar to what we talked about on our last call. So the higher tax rate that you're seeing this time compared to what we talked about on our first quarter call are directly attributable to the fact that we've got all these charges. It's just pushing our income down, and so it ends up pushing our rates up. When we normalize our earnings like for example in this quarter, our normal tax rate would be in that 28.5% range.\nAnalysts: Got it. And then last question, just because I think there is some confusion around depreciation as I look at different estimates fairly wide range. Could you help us understand what is accelerated depreciation in 2018 and will not kind of recur in '19? And maybe whether you think that depreciation as a whole would be potentially less in '19 than the '18 overall.\nExecutives: Yes, '19 will definitely be less. We're at a higher level this year, call it 30 basis points or so. That's due to 2 things. One is due to retiring assets as a result of our refresh. We're investing in operating our restaurants, so that requires accelerated depreciation on the items that are going to be taken out of the restaurant. And then secondly, part of the restaurants that haven't closed yet, we leave a little bit on the books. GAAP requires that you leave a little bit of the asset on the books and then you right that off over the remaining time that you expect to have restaurants to be open. And so as the M&R that we're doing, the refresh that we're doing, as that depreciation levels off, that'll be replaced by this higher depreciation from the stores that we're going to close, but that should fall off. Most of it should fall off this year, maybe into early next year, and then our depreciation should go to more than normal historical rates.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of our question-and-answer session, and I would like to turn the call back over to Chipotle CEO, Brian Niccol, for closing remarks.\nExecutives: Okay. Well, thank you, everybody. I know this is a busy earnings time, so I appreciate everybody taking the time to listen to our results and have a discussion of the business. And thanks again, and I'm sure we'll be in touch. Take care.\nOperator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.\nOperator: Greetings, and welcome to Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Chipotle. Please go ahead.\nExecutives: Hi, everyone, and welcome to our call today. By now, you should have access to our earnings announcement released this afternoon for the second quarter of 2018.\nIt may also be found on our Investor Relations website at ir.chipotle.com.\nBefore we begin our presentation, I will remind everyone that parts of our discussion today will include forward-looking statements as defined in the securities laws.\nThese forward-looking statements will include statements regarding the expected benefits from our strategic focus areas or specific business initiatives; the potential opportunity for our digital sales; sales trends and forecasts for future comparable sales; expected new restaurant openings; estimates of future food, labor, marketing and maintenance and repair costs; statements about our expected effective tax rate and projections of the amount and timing of unusual cost items and stock repurchases as well as other statements of our expectations and plans.\nThese statements are based on information available to us today, and we are not assuming any obligation to update them.\nForward-looking statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.\nWe refer you to the risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K, as updated, and our subsequent Form 10-Qs for a discussion of these risks.\nOur discussion today will also include non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations of which can be found on the Presentation page of the Investor Relations section of our website. I'd also like to remind everyone that we've adopted a self-imposed quiet period, restricting communications with investors during that period.\nThe quiet period will begin on the 16th day of the last month of each fiscal quarter and continues until the next earnings conference call.\nFor the third quarter of 2018, it will begin September 16 and continue through our third quarter earnings release.\nWe will start today's call with some prepared remarks from Brian Niccol, Chief Executive Officer; and Jack Hartung, Chief Financial Officer. After which, we will take questions. In the room and also available during the Q&A period are Scott Boatwright, Chief Restaurant Officer; Curt Garner, Chief Digital and Information Officer; Chris Brandt, Chief Marketing Officer; Laurie Schalow, Chief Communications Officer; and Marissa Andrada, Chief Human Resources Officer. \nAnd now, I will turn the call over to Brian Niccol.\nExecutives: Thanks, Coralie, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report a solid second quarter with sales and restaurant-level margins ahead of our expectations. \nTotal sales grew 8.3% to $1.27 billion, driven by comparable sales of 3.3% and 34 new restaurants opened in the quarter. This positive comparable sales trajectory enabled us to expand restaurant-level margins, which were up 90 basis points year-over-year to 19.7%. Earnings per share adjusted for unusual costs grew nearly 24% to $2.87, and our GAAP earnings were $1.68. \nWhile Jack will go through the financials in more detail shortly, I'd like to put these results into context by discussing how the work our 70,000 employees do every day contributed to these financial outcomes. \nLast month, we shared with you that we would execute our strategy to win today and cultivate the future by focusing on these 5 areas: becoming a more culturally relevant and engaging brand that builds love and loyalty; digitizing and modernizing our restaurant experience to create a more convenient and enjoyable guest experience; running great restaurants with great hospitality and throughput; being disciplined and focused to enhance our powerful economic model; and building a great culture that can innovate and execute across digital, access, menu and the restaurant experience. \nToday, I'll focus on how innovation in digital and access and how improving our operations contributed to this quarter's results. Let me begin with operations. \nWe know that strong sales growth and margins are dependent on great operations, which is the hallmark of any healthy brand. This brand was founded on outstanding operations and real food. We are getting back to our roots. When we have the right people leading the right teams and when those teams are well trained and operating with confidence, they execute great guest experiences. \nIt takes time to build a culture of accountability, and I'm pleased that we are seeing some encouraging signs of progress in key areas, namely, our restaurant AB scores, a measurement system we implemented 1.5 years ago to drive greater accountability, is trending in the right direction. We are doing a better job staffing our restaurants to match sales volumes, and we have lower year-over-year hourly turnover, which tells us we are making progress on training and building great teams. \nAdditionally, we have seen a meaningful decline in guest complaints, and with that, our guest satisfaction scores have improved since we started measuring them last year. This tells us that we've made progress and that our guests are noticing the difference. We know that when the food is delicious, the feel of the restaurant is great, and we remove the friction from the flow of the order process, no matter the channel, we delight customers.\nWhile I'm encouraged by our progress, we still have a lot of work to do. We have an opportunity to improve throughput, consistent execution of great food and consistent delivery of a great atmosphere. I'll outline some of the initiatives underway to address those opportunities. We are halfway through our big fix initiative, which is designed to bring our restaurants back up to standards and make them uniquely Chipotle. This not only improves the guest experience, as the appearance of our restaurants is clean and well maintained for every guest, but the team member experience improves as well. \nWe overhauled our training materials several months ago and have retrained 3/4 of our field leaders through Cultivate University. That's an in-restaurant and in-classroom 1-week training session that we launched in April. That investment and the ongoing development of our field leadership continue to drive crew member engagement. We are supplementing that training with a new hospitality training program in the restaurants, and we're in the early innings of refining our training to teach and taste the details, so that we achieve the winning combination of great food, feel and flow with every guest experience. \nWe are zeroing in on how to get back to great throughput, as speed of service is a foundational element of convenience that our guests truly value. Late last year, we rolled out what we call the owner's path, a comprehensive review of our restaurant's performance. Equipping our field leaders with this tool is improving their powers of observation and allowing them to focus on the critical details of delivering an improved guest experience. In addition, the tool creates teaching moments for their general managers and documents that corrective actions are taken when needed. We're currently rolling out a digital version for mobile phones and tablets of this previous paper-based tool. That should result in more consistent operations across our restaurants. We'll have this in place nationally by October. \nWe're also in the process of redesigning our forecasting and labor scheduling tool. This is a significant undertaking but necessary for us to have accurate sales forecasting and deliver the right amount of labor at the right time to meet the needs of our guests. \nThe new tool will have a best-in-class sales forecasting component that will leverage machine learning to remove the guesswork of determining sales and labor needs for our business. In addition, our team members will have the ability to see their schedules remotely and swap shifts from mobile phones, taking these tasks out of the hands of the manager. We believe leveraging technologies such as this makes us a more desirable employer as we work to create a better experience for our crew members. We will continue to make investments in our restaurants because a better experience for our team members directly translates to a better experience for our guests. \nI'd also like to talk to you about the progress we are making around innovation in digital and access, as this was a real bright spot in the quarter. Today, our annualized digital sales are approximately $0.5 billion, and we are in the early stages of this multibillion-dollar opportunity. Our digital sales grew 33% in the quarter and now account for 10.3% of sales, an acceleration from 20% growth in the first quarter. \nWe now have 4 million active monthly users across our app and our website, a 65% increase since the end of last year. Delivery and group occasions were particularly strong this quarter. Delivery sales quadrupled in the quarter and we know from our customer research that improving access to Chipotle is an important growth lever, whether it be through adding more restaurants or enabling more convenience like delivery. \nToday, delivery is available from 1,700 restaurants and we expect that to reach 2,000 restaurants by year-end. We're also pleased that delivery is now an option available directly from our app. \nOur group ordering business was solid in the seasonally strong quarter for catering orders. In mid-July, we expanded our build-your-own catering offer nationally, whereby we lowered the minimum size and offered more price tiers for group orders therefore expanding access for more occasions. We tested this enhancement early in the year and found that group order sales in our test stores outperformed the base by mid to high single digits. \nDelivery availability for catering expanded to 2/3 of our restaurants in the quarter. As I have mentioned, Chipotle's second make-line enables the business to handle the incremental growth without any impact on throughput or the in-restaurant experience. I'm happy to see progress on  digitizing our second make-lines, which are now in roughly 500 restaurants. We're targeting approximately 1,000 restaurants to be enabled with a digital second make-line by year-end, and we are accelerating our rollout to reach completion by the end of 2019. \nThese digital second make-lines have a direct positive impact on the team member and guest experience. Also, the digital pickup-shelf test in several New York City restaurants continues to show great promise. And based on the results to date, we will be expanding the test to a larger number of restaurants in several markets next month. \nWe've mentioned before that we are undertaking a wide-ranging consumer research project, with the results available this fall. I did, however, want to mention a few interesting highlights that we've uncovered so far. Access is the #1 lever we can pull to drive sales, which supports our new unit growth as well as the innovation focus around the access via our digital channels. Additionally, we sit at in an interesting intersection between fast food and fast casual, with many attributes such as value and speed that are typically associated with fast food and attributes such as quality and freshness, which are typically associated with fast-casual. \nWe're particularly strong with millennial and Generation Z customers relative to most brands. And when these groups try us, our odds of repeat visits are much higher. These early insights give us confidence that new news and the more engaging marketing that we're beginning to see will allow us to drive transaction growth. Also, I'm pleased with the speed at which we are getting transaction-driving initiatives across digital, access, loyalty and menu into test markets. \nThe combination of these test markets and our early insights from our consumer research will inform our plans in 2019 and beyond. \nBefore I turn it over to Jack, I want to thank all of our team members across the country that are working diligently to serve our guests real food, cooked to perfection and prepared in our restaurants with fresh ingredients, just the way our guests like it. This hard work is the basis for all of our future success, and we appreciate it tremendously. Now over to you, Jack.\nExecutives: Thanks, Brian. I'm really pleased that our team's focus on our 5 strategic priorities has contributed to a high-quality quarter with comp sales of 3.3% and a 19.7% restaurant-level margin. And underlying earnings were also strong after adjusting for a number of unusual costs during the quarter. As we discussed on our call last month, we'll continue to see costs over the next few quarters associated with our restructuring, relocation and underperforming store closures. These charges also have a temporary impact on our tax rates, which I'll talk about in more detail later. \nWe generated revenue of $1.27 billion during the quarter, an increase of 8.3% from last year on comp sales growth of 3.3%. That's on top of last year's strong 8.1% Q2 comp sales increase. \nRestaurant-level margins of 19.7% expanded 90 basis points from last year, and normalized earnings per share adjusted for the unusual items was $2.87. \nThe second quarter had unusual expenses mostly related to the transformation, and that negatively impacted EPS by about $1.19, leading to a GAAP earnings per share of $1.68. In Q2, we expensed about $25 million in expenses related to restaurant asset write-offs, approximately $16.5 million related to office closures and $7 million related to the restructure of our organization and other unusual expenses. These charges were offset by a nonrecurring benefit of about $6.5 million related to lower stock comp expense as a result of the restructure. As a result of these transformation expenses, our tax rate increased about 400 basis points, which I'll explain later. \nThe Q2 comp of 3.3% was primarily driven by higher average checks due to the price increases taken over the last year as well as queso add-ons. Price increase averaged about 4% in the quarter, and customer resistance to the price increase remains at or below 20%. \nThe menu price impact was lower than Q1 as we lapped the first increase from April of last year in about 20% of our restaurants. Sales trends in the first 3 weeks of July continue to mirror what we saw in Q2, with the comp increasing over the last week or so as we've begun to compare against those softer trends from last year. \nSo overall, comps should improve from the 3.3% in Q2. However, keep in mind that comparisons will get tougher later in Q3 as we lap the introduction of queso in early September, which initially added about 3.5% to the comp before settling into a sustained benefit to the average check of about 2%. And in November, we will lap the price increase in about 1,000 restaurants, which added an additional 1.3% prorated impact to the comp. \nBased on second quarter results and expected improvement in the Q3 comp, we're increasing our full year comp sales guidance from low single digits to a low to mid-single-digit comp range. \nWe opened 34 new restaurants in the quarter and expect to be at the lower end of our 130 to 150 new opening guidance for the full year. While we're still building inventory for next year's openings, we continue to expect 2019 openings will be at or above the 2018 levels. \nOur new restaurants this year have opened strong, and we're continuing to emphasize high-quality, high-returning new restaurants as we build out our pipeline. \nAs mentioned on our last call, we expect to close between 55 and 65 underperforming restaurants. And today, we're closing 29 Chipotle restaurants. \nDuring the second quarter, we closed 5 Pizzeria Locales in Kansas and Ohio, and we also closed 3 Chipotle restaurants, including 1 relocation. So with today's closures about half of the underperforming restaurants have now closed. \nFood cost for the quarter were 32.6%, a decrease of 150 basis points from the 34.1% in Q2 of last year. The decrease from last year was driven by the menu price increase and more favorable avocado prices. The decreases were slightly offset by elevated prices for our steak and barbacoa. We expect food cost increase to the low 33% range in Q3 due to the seasonal shift to source higher cost avocados from California and an uptick in paper and packaging costs. We expect to be closer to the 33% in Q4 as we begin to shift the supply of avocados back to Mexico. \nLabor costs for the quarter were 27%, an increase of 80 basis points from the 26.2% in Q2 of last year. The increase from last year was driven primarily from wage inflation of about 6% and increased restaurant manager bonus costs as we returned to normalized bonus payouts, rewarding our managers for delivering strong results. \nThese increases were offset by leverage from the menu price increase. We expect labor costs to increase to the high 27% range in Q3 and to the mid-28% range in Q4, and these increases are driven primarily by seasonally lower sales in Q3 and Q4 and by general wage pressures. \nOccupancy costs for the quarter were 6.9%, which is flat with last year. Other operating costs for the quarter were 13.8%, a decrease of 20 basis points from Q2 of last year. \nOur marketing and promo costs were 3.2% in the quarter, a decrease of about 40 basis points compared to Q2 of last year. We expect marketing and promo costs to be at or slightly above 3% of sales for the full year, with elevated spending continuing in Q3 and Q4. \nOther operating costs continue to include about 30 basis points of higher maintenance and repair costs, which we first discussed on our Q4 call, and we expect M&R to continue at this elevated level for the rest of the year. \nG&A in the quarter increased by $8 million compared to Q1 of this year. The increase compared to last quarter was primarily due to the stock comp forfeitures and the timing of the 2018 equity grant that we discussed on the last earnings call. \nAnd as I mentioned earlier, G&A also included $7 million in charges related to the restructuring and additional unusual charges in the quarter, but those were offset by a $6.5 million nonrecurring benefit related to revising our estimates of forfeitures related to stock grants for employees expected to leave the company. \nThe G&A increase compared to Q2 of last year was primarily in support of our restaurant growth, digitizing our restaurant experience and operational leadership changes in the field. \nDepreciation expense for the quarter was 3.9%, an increase of 40 basis points from the 3.5% in Q2 of last year. This increase is due to the accelerated depreciation for items we're replacing related to the maintenance and repair refresh as well as capital initiatives that we described on our Q4 call. We expect the increase related to the refresh to fall off in the second half of the year. \nHowever, it will be replaced by accelerated depreciation from the restaurant closures we detailed earlier. As a result, we expect depreciation to remain at this elevated level for the rest of this year. \nOur pretax income was $70 million and our reported effective tax rate was 33.3%. Our tax rate was higher than the 29% underlying rate we discussed on our last earnings call and is a direct result of the $42 million in unusual expenses this quarter. \nWithout these charges, our tax rate would have been right around a 28.5% effective rate, and we expect to return to a roughly 29% rate next year when the transformation charges are fully behind us. This underlying rate of about 29% may be affected in future years by stock comp vesting and exercises when the benefit realized by our employees varies from our accounting treatment, and we'll fully call out these impacts as they occur. \nWe continue to expect the transformation costs from the restructuring, restaurant closures and other unusual costs will total between $115 million and $135 million, with most of that amount hitting in 2018. We estimate that about $50 million to $55 million will hit in Q3, with most of the remainder in Q4. There will likely be some charges related to terminating restaurant and office leases that will spill into 2019. \nWe'll also write off about $10 million in deferred tax assets beginning in Q4, with most hitting in 2019 as fully vested but underwater options will likely expire as we complete the restructure of the organization. \nIn Q3, we expect our effective tax rate to be right around 30.3% or about 130 basis points higher than we guided last quarter. In Q4, we expect our tax rate to be as high as 43% or about 450 basis points higher than we guided last quarter. Both of these increases are due to a lower pretax income as a result of the transformation expenses. \nAs mentioned during our Q1 call, our Q4 rate is impacted by performance shares that will likely expire in that period because the performance shares will only vest if the stock price is over $700. We took deductions on these performance shares over the years but if they prove worthless, we won't get a tax benefit contributing to the estimated 43% tax rate. \nWe'll continue to provide more specifics on future transformation-related costs when we have more certainty around the timing, and we will continue to break out the unusual costs from normal costs so you can follow the underlying trends. \nWe're encouraged by our second quarter results and the contributions of our restaurant teams to deliver an excellent guest experience. We're also encouraged by our guest response to our digital initiative so far, along with a solid sales and restaurant-level margin performance during the quarter. We're confident that significant changes we're making to our organization will enable us to continue to improve operational excellence in our restaurants, to be more nimble and innovative in digital, access, menu and the restaurant environment, and to execute better to deliver on our commitments to our guests, our employees and our shareholders. And now, we're happy to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Sara Senatore with Bernstein.\nAnalysts: Just on the 2Q, the implication is with 4 points of price, I think that you saw some negative traffic. And I guess, how do you turn that around? And in particular, you talked about really a lot of growth in digital usage. But do you think you're substituting -- just substituting from walk-in orders or can you actually tell that these orders are incremental? And are you starting to build a database of your customers that might allow for better targeted marketing?\nExecutives: Yes. Thanks for the question. Obviously, I think I may have mentioned in my early remarks, a lot of our new transaction-driving initiatives are getting ready to head to pilot, and we also are working on some new marketing communication as well. So I think as those things start to enter markets and then we gain learnings on how to improve those programs and then plan for national execution, the goal is to use the staged-gate process then to inform what our sales and transaction performance can be going forward. The good news is our price increase that we passed through has passed through nicely. We're not seeing customer counts retreat versus anything we've seen historically when we take pricing. I mean, regarding your question on digital sales, obviously, there's multiple elements to that, right? There's the delivery aspect, there's our catering, and then there's also the app or website orders. And we see varying degrees of incrementality across each of those spaces. The thing that we do know, though, is when we get a digital order through that second make-line, the economics of that order are very attractive, and then our customer satisfaction scores also are very attractive. So we've continued to see improvements on accuracy and speed at which we're getting people the food they want, when they want, where they want it. So still a lot to learn. And actually, when we get the pilot going on our loyalty program, I think that's going to give us another level of insight and understanding on exactly how all these transactions are interacting with each other. And that's a new skill we're going to be building for the organization going forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Tarantino.\nAnalysts: Just maybe a clarification question on the comps for the quarter. Could you maybe explain how the trend transpired as the quarter progressed? It sounded as if, on the last call, you might have started a little slow and then maybe picked up later in the quarter. But is that accurate? Or how should we think about that?\nExecutives: Yes, David. I think that is accurate. We talked on the last call that in April, because of weather and the seasonal shift of Easter, that we got off to a slow start. May was a great month for us, that's when we had the DoorDash promotion, so May looked great. And then June settled in right at about the overall average for the month. So I would say, the overall comp of 3.3% is a good kind of gauge for what the underlying trend was. A little less in April, more in May but then we settled out right in the middle in June. And so, we feel good about the way that we ended the quarter and how we're entering the third quarter now.\nAnalysts: Great. That's helpful. And then, I guess, Jack or Brian, that does suggest a little bit of underlying improvement in at least the way we look at the business on a sequential basis on traffic. So could you maybe talk about what you think drove that improvement, whether it was the operations improvements you talked about? And then on the operations improvements in particular, is there any sort of deeper look at that data that would suggest that's moving the needle as you kind of split the restaurants that are doing the best from the worst apart from one another?\nExecutives: Yes. Look, I don't think it was just 1 thing. The good news is though, as I've mentioned earlier, we've seen improvement in our operations on all the key metrics. And we continue to hear more and more positive customer feedback on their experiences and fewer -- or a reduction in customer complaints. And we believe there's even more opportunity for us to get even better on throughput going forward. So we're pleased with the progress we're making on ops. We also saw in the quarter, people really responded positively to the advertising that we put out there. And then obviously, we've seen very positive responses to varying elements of our digital program. So I think it was a combination of multiple things, not 1 thing that drove it. And that's what has us excited about how we're moving forward with all the pilots across the business. We're making progress, I think, on ops, we're making progress on digital, and we're making progress on really understanding our customer base better. So that, you know what, we get the brands the right message, then with the right food at the right place with the right value, I think we'll continue to see improvement in our performance.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nicole Miller with Piper Jaffray.\nAnalysts: Culture of accountability. Could you talk a little bit more about maybe how it's changed to work in the store day-to-day? And how are you aligning that with incentives to have the employees make these changes?\nExecutives: Nicole, I think we missed the first part of your question. Could you just start from the beginning?\nAnalysts: Absolutely. So asking about the culture of accountability, and I thought it was helpful how you talked about how that translated to the customer engagement or improved guest satisfaction. So what I'm wondering is from the employee perspective, in that store, how is it different to work there today than before? And what are the incentives that you have put in place to keep them aligned with your culture of accountability?\nExecutives: Yes. Thanks for the question. Obviously, one of the things that I think Scott's done a nice job in the field is the accountability is both on developing a great team as well as being accountable to providing a great experience for the customer. So I think we're starting to see our teams being more staffed correctly, engaged at another level than where they had been over the last couple years, and everybody has clarity on what their role is on the team. And I think we've talked about this in the past, but we've given everybody their kind of top 5 responsibilities, which then gives the team the ability to trust that each other is going to be doing be doing what they need to do for them to be successful. And then to your question on incentives, yes, we've moved to some quarterly bonus programs and we've seen that actually have a material impact on our employee satisfaction with -- when they make great progress then they get rewarded much closer to when they have that success. So I think it's the combination really of making sure that we're holding ourselves accountable to a great experience but also holding ourselves accountable to develop a great team and then obviously rewarding them when they have successes.\nAnalysts: And then just a final question. When you think about the structural framework previously of a $2 million AUV translating loosely to a 20% store-level margin, you're doing that yet you have over 3 percentage points of marketing that is at least twice as much as what it had been historically. So it seems that there might be more leverage in the model. Is there any kind of framework you could give or update for us to think about as we model going forward?\nExecutives: Nicole, we've also got M&R just a little high as well. So I mean, the results we're seeing in the last couple of quarters give us even more confidence that the model, at $2 million, gets you right about in that high teens to 20% margin. And as we grow the volume from there, we think we can move back up into the 20-plus percent margin. So the things that we thought the model can do, I think we're starting to see that they're coming to [ life ].\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets.\nAnalysts: Brian, you mentioned some statistics earlier about how the fast-casual occasion, perhaps, overlaps with that of fast food in some ways with younger generations and that trial seems to be important with these consumers. I'm trying to understand what you're seeing and saying about the opportunity there. In the past, I think Chipotle tried to get trial going, coupons and the like, with this understanding that if you get trial, they'll come back. But how are you thinking about marketing perhaps different than that and using the data you're seeing?\nExecutives: Sure, yes. So I think I mentioned this in our call a couple weeks ago. We've got a big foundational consumer study out, and we're starting to get some top lines in. And what we have definitely seen is when people try the brand and have a positive experience with it, their intent to stay with the brand is much higher than a lot of our competitors in both fast-casual as well as fast food. And it's very exciting because when we look at younger people, we get an even more positive response to intent and then intent to stay with us. So that's what I was referencing. And then the brand, obviously, I think we all instinctually see this as very much a purpose-driven brand that syncs up nicely with Gen Z and millennials, and we're seeing that play out in our research as well. So we're going to want to continue to build on that strength as we move forward.\nAnalysts: And Jack, you mentioned the restructuring expense that you expect. I know it's not typical, necessarily, in the sector, but could you talk about the dollar savings you anticipate or maybe the return on investment from these store closures and restructuring expenses and the timing of that? Any color would be helpful.\nExecutives: Yes, David. On the restaurants we're closing, these are all cash flow-losing restaurants. We've got about half of them closed right now. So it's going to take -- before we can see the full effect, we're going to have to have them all closed. But we should pick up somewhere in the 20, 30 basis points of margin once they're all closed. So there's a definite improvement in our margin returns from that standpoint. Most of the other costs, that's more with restructuring the organization. There's going to be return on that. It's not going to be as black and white or linear. The return is going to be on having a culture that's more innovative, a culture that's more results-oriented. And we think there's going to be lots and lots of benefits there, but it's going to be less of a cause and effect where we can tell you what the actual return is.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Karen Holthouse with Goldman Sachs.\nAnalysts: This is actually Jared on for Karen. Can you guys give us a sense of maybe delivery as a percent of your total sales at this point, and maybe just some context about how delivery is contributing to a stronger comp in 2Q versus 3Q?\nExecutives: Yes, delivery is a piece of that 10% number that I mentioned earlier on our digital sales. And what we're seeing is, today, we're in 1,700 restaurants, we'll be expanding to closer to 2,000 here shortly. Really, the delivery performance, not surprising, right now, what we're seeing is it really is impacted by how we promote it, because we're in the early days of getting people to even understand that it's available. I think, the last number I saw, we still have over 50% of customers not realizing Chipotle is available for delivery. So we're seeing some variability in the delivery performance based on how we promote with these partners. The thing that is exciting though is we are seeing, when we get that bump, we don't fall below where we were. So we're continuing to see progress. And I think, over time, as we build awareness, build a habit, I think we'll see this play a bigger and bigger role in getting us into an off-premise occasion.\nAnalysts: And if I could just follow up with 1 more. Have you guys seen any learnings early on the new menu test items that you have in tests right now?\nExecutives: Sure. I think I mentioned this earlier. We're actually -- you've seen the products in our NEXT Kitchen where that's really just for us to look at operational execution. And we're just getting ready to use our staged-gate process to move a handful of initiatives into an actual test market, where we'll be at scale, where we'll start to really have true learnings of customer experience, team member experience and then how that plays out on total Chipotle performance. So too early to comment on any of those items right now.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andy Barish with Jefferies.\nAnalysts: Two things just on -- can you help us understand as you start to lap, I think you mentioned, Jack, the July issues last year in Virginia, just how we should think about that maybe 500 or 600 basis points decline in traffic kind of coming back?\nExecutives: Yes, Andy. There's a couple things going on right now. We're also comparing against, right now, SAVOR.WAVS. So we did see a nice uptick in a comp in the last week or so as we compare it to the soft sales from last year. But SAVOR.WAVS happened as well, which there was a big BOGO, a lot of buy one, get one. And so, that's creating a little bit of noise, but we do expect to see much more attractive traffic and much more attractive sales comps over the next several weeks. And that'll only be slowed a bit as we compare to the launch of queso last year, which I talked about in my prepared comments. So yes, we're already seeing the positive effect from the comparisons to last year -- to the softness from last year.\nAnalysts: Got you. And then anything on sort of pricing as you do the research on the brand, the ability to be a more regular menu price increase taker instead of every several years as has been the case in the past?\nExecutives: Yes. So one of the things we're definitely looking to understand is exactly the health over value equation. The good news is, our value continues to be very strong. And what we're assessing right now is what is the right approach to sequencing pricing over time, making sure we don't ever get ahead of a great value equation? So that's part of the consumer research, frankly, that we've got going on right now. As we get those learnings back, it we will inform how we approach pricing going forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays.\nAnalysts: This is actually Jeff Priester on for Jeff Bernstein. Operationally, given all these initiatives, including your potential new items coming from the NEXT Kitchen, and I know, in New York, some of the pickup shelves around the end of your actual make-line, is there going to be an issue down the line where implementing some of these initiatives where you need to expand the line or reorganize it to get some of these things out there? And then I have 1 follow-up.\nExecutives: Yes, sure. So I think I've mentioned this before. Obviously, everything we're looking at has to be thoughtfully executed so that the throughput engine of Chipotle is not jeopardized. And I think I mentioned this earlier, there's some projects that frankly, just are a bolt-on. So like a digital-shelf pickup, that actually improves the customer experience and the team member experience because it illuminates that confusion for where the mobile order person is supposed to go, that awkward moment at the cashier, it eliminates a lot of that. So that, in our opinion, is a throughput enabler because 2 things happen. One, it merchandises the fact that you can do this mobile ordering and not have to go through the line. And then the second piece is it really takes advantage of our second make-line, which is, I think, a huge advantage to open up an off-premise business. But look, the varying initiatives, if it comes with needs for new equipment, we'll test out the new equipment and make sure that it works and plays nicely with the throughput engine that we have. If it doesn't, then that's why we use the staged-gate process to learn and figure out how we try again. And it's going to be an [ intricate ] process with us, so I'm very excited that we're going to start the process of seeing some of these pilots get into market, so that we protect the integrity of what's made Chipotle great, while we figure out how we enhance relevance and dial up engagement.\nAnalysts: Great. And then on delivery, can you give us a sense of the average check you're seeing relative to your dining customer and then, as well as the number of customers per order, the number of entrées per order, however you want to approach it?\nExecutives: Yes, I mean, we see obviously, a nice increase in our digital orders. So the mobile and delivery orders are in that $16 to $17 range versus our traditional check is in the $12 range. And we're still learning, frankly, what is the order size that comes with it versus additional attachments like chips and guac and queso and so on and so forth. But we're really seeing a blend, right now, of both there are times we see more add-ons and then there are times where clearly it's a larger group occasion that's off-premise that's ordering through the app or through the delivery third party.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.\nAnalysts: This Brandon on for John. I believe on the first quarter call, you mentioned that you expected marketing and promo to be elevated throughout the remainder of the year. Do you still expect that to play out throughout the back half of '18 here?\nExecutives: Yes, we were -- it will be a little elevated. We were light in the first quarter, we were at 3.2% this past quarter, and we'll be right at about that same 3.2%. So overall for the year, we'll average right at about 3% for the overall year.\nAnalysts: Got it, okay. And then I just had a follow up. You mentioned in your prepared remarks, the restaurant AB and guest sat scores are beginning to trend in the right direction. Could you elaborate on that comment and maybe quantify some of those improvements?\nExecutives: Yes. So the restaurant AB is the measurement tool that we use that's a couple of metrics that are very important to us that cover financials, people, guest experience and the team, okay? And what we're happy to see is we're seeing a nice move from Bs to As, and that's a good sign. So it's a very important metric, it's one that Scott keeps a laser eye on, and it's a good way for us to understand how we're performing in our restaurants and how we're actually making progress.\nOperator: Our final question comes from the line of Jake Bartlett with SunTrust.\nAnalysts: Great. First, I just wanted to get a sense for how much of the initiatives are driving or how much the improved outlook in the back is driven by the initiatives or driven by the easy to compares? And I know in terms of the initiatives, there's a lot of unknown timing. But maybe you can talk about what you do know. For instance, I believe when you get your study back on the consumer, that's going to be the source of a new advertising campaign, maybe some impact of the change in the new catering menu. I'm thinking about the shelf rollout. You just mentioned how kind of a no-brainer it is. I mean, is that really a test that's going on or is that just kind of a -- I mean, should we expect that to be rolled out here in the back half?\nExecutives: You know what, I didn't hear the last part of your question, but let me answer the first part, which is, as we've talked about our guidance, it's got very -- it's got nearly 0 on the initiatives that we've been talking about that we are putting into pilot and that we're going to start expanding over the course of the year. So what we're seeing right now, I think is what I mentioned earlier, which is I think we're seeing a nice improvement in our operational performance. I think we've got more visible, more effective, more relevant marketing out there, and I think we've done a nice job of expanding access through our digital efforts. I think it's going to continue to be the combination of all those things plus, as we get some learning on loyalty and potentially some new menus items down the road, that we'll see initiatives play then, hopefully, a bigger role going forward. But as of right now, there's -- I think it's very minimal. And what was the second part of your question?\nAnalysts: The second part was just your initiatives like the digital -- like, the shelves, the pickup shelves. You mentioned a kind of it's a no-brainer operationally. I mean, what is the [ optional ] to just kind of rolling that out and not considering it a test but kind of just seeing a roll out. What is there to test with that?\nExecutives: Yes. So look, I think, as an organization, we're going to be a test-and-learn organization before we go launch. And even though going into, where we've put it in these 5 stores, our early indications were it's a no-brainer. The good news is in the first 5 stores, it went as we had hoped. And as a result, we're expanding now to 4 or 5 markets in very short order. And then the goal is, assuming we continue to see the positive performance, we'll get it across the system in very short order thereafter.\nAnalysts: Great. And Jack, a clarification on the tax guidance. I'm just looking, if I think about adjusted earnings comparable to the $2.87 that you mentioned today, I look at the adjusted tax rate there, and it's 28.5% is my estimate. So when you think about the third quarter effective tax rate that you've mentioned in the fourth quarter, is that more relevant to GAAP earnings? Or is that relevant to the adjusted earnings we might be focused on?\nExecutives: Those rates are more GAAP earnings. The underlying rates are going to be more similar to what we talked about on our last call. So the higher tax rates that you're seeing this time compared to what we talked about on our first quarter call are directly attributable to the fact that we've got all these charges. It's just pushing our income down, and so it ends up pushing our rates up. When we normalize our earnings, like for example in this quarter, our normal tax rate would be in that 28.5% range.\nAnalysts: Got it. And then last question, just because I think there is some confusion around depreciation as I look at different estimates, a fairly wide range. Could you help us understand what is accelerated depreciation in 2018 and will not kind of recur in '19? And maybe whether you think that depreciation as a whole would be potentially less in '19 than the '18 overall.\nExecutives: Yes, '19 will definitely be less. We're at a higher level this year, call it 30 basis points or so. That's due to 2 things. One is due to retiring assets as a result of our refresh. We're investing in operating our restaurants, so that requires accelerated depreciation on the items that are going to be taken out of the restaurant. And then secondly, part of the restaurants that haven't closed yet, we leave a little bit on the books. GAAP requires that you leave a little bit of the asset on the books and then you write that off over the remaining time that you expect that restaurant to be open. And so as the M&R that we're doing, the refresh that we're doing, as that depreciation levels off, that'll be replaced by this higher depreciation from the stores that we're going to close, but that should fall off. Most of it should fall off this year, maybe into early next year, and then our depreciation should go to more the normal historical rates.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of our question-and-answer session, and I would like to turn the call back over to Chipotle CEO, Brian Niccol, for closing remarks.\nExecutives: Okay. Well, thank you, everybody. I know this is a busy earnings time, so I appreciate everybody taking the time to listen to our results and have a discussion of the business. And thanks again, and I'm sure we'll be in touch. Take care.\nOperator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.\nOperator: Greetings, and welcome to Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. \nI would now like to turn the conference over to Chipotle. Please go ahead.\nExecutives: Hi, everyone, and welcome to our call today. By now, you should have access to our earnings announcement released this afternoon for the second quarter of 2018. It may also be found on our Investor Relations website at ir.chipotle.com.\nBefore we begin our presentation, I will remind everyone that parts of our discussion today will include forward-looking statements as defined in the securities laws. These forward-looking statements will include statements regarding the expected benefits from our strategic focus areas or specific business initiatives; the potential opportunity for our digital sales; sales trends and forecasts for future comparable sales; expected new restaurant openings; estimates of future food, labor, marketing and maintenance and repair costs; statements about our expected effective tax rate and projections of the amount and timing of unusual cost items and stock repurchases as well as other statements of our expectations and plans. These statements are based on information available to us today, and we are not assuming any obligation to update them.\nForward-looking statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. We refer you to the risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K, as updated, and our subsequent Form 10-Qs for a discussion of these risks. Our discussion today will also include non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations of which can be found on the Presentation page of the Investor Relations section of our website. I'd also like to remind everyone that we've adopted a self-imposed quiet period, restricting communications with investors during that period. The quiet period will begin on the 16th day of the last month of each fiscal quarter and continues until the next earnings conference call.\nFor the third quarter of 2018, it will begin September 16 and continue through our third quarter earnings release. We will start today's call with some prepared remarks from Brian Niccol, Chief Executive Officer; and Jack Hartung, Chief Financial Officer. After which, we will take questions. In the room and also available during the Q&A period are Scott Boatwright, Chief Restaurant Officer; Curt Garner, Chief Digital and Information Officer; Chris Brandt, Chief Marketing Officer; Laurie Schalow, Chief Communications Officer; and Marissa Andrada, Chief Human Resources Officer. \nAnd now, I will turn the call over to Brian Niccol.\nExecutives: Thanks, Coralie, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report a solid second quarter with sales and restaurant-level margins ahead of our expectations. \nTotal sales grew 8.3% to $1.27 billion, driven by comparable sales of 3.3% and 34 new restaurants opened in the quarter. This positive comparable sales trajectory enabled us to expand restaurant-level margins, which were up 90 basis points year-over-year to 19.7%. Earnings per share adjusted for unusual costs grew nearly 24% to $2.87, and our GAAP earnings were $1.68. \nWhile Jack will go through the financials in more detail shortly, I'd like to put these results into context by discussing how the work our 70,000 employees do every day contributed to these financial outcomes. \nLast month, we shared with you that we would execute our strategy to win today and cultivate the future by focusing on these 5 areas: becoming a more culturally relevant and engaging brand that builds love and loyalty; digitizing and modernizing our restaurant experience to create a more convenient and enjoyable guest experience; running great restaurants with great hospitality and throughput; being disciplined and focused to enhance our powerful economic model; and building a great culture that can innovate and execute across digital, access, menu and the restaurant experience. \nToday, I'll focus on how innovation in digital and access and how improving our operations contributed to this quarter's results. Let me begin with operations. \nWe know that strong sales growth and margins are dependent on great operations, which is the hallmark of any healthy brand. This brand was founded on outstanding operations and real food. We are getting back to our roots. When we have the right people leading the right teams and when those teams are well trained and operating with confidence, they execute great guest experiences. \nIt takes time to build a culture of accountability, and I'm pleased that we are seeing some encouraging signs of progress in key areas, namely, our restaurant AB scores, a measurement system we implemented 1.5 years ago to drive greater accountability, is trending in the right direction. We are doing a better job staffing our restaurants to match sales volumes, and we have lower year-over-year hourly turnover, which tells us we are making progress on training and building great teams. \nAdditionally, we have seen a meaningful decline in guest complaints, and with that, our guest satisfaction scores have improved since we started measuring them last year. This tells us that we've made progress and that our guests are noticing the difference. We know that when the food is delicious, the feel of the restaurant is great, and we remove the friction from the flow of the order process, no matter the channel, we delight customers.\nWhile I'm encouraged by our progress, we still have a lot of work to do. We have an opportunity to improve throughput, consistent execution of great food and consistent delivery of a great atmosphere. I'll outline some of the initiatives underway to address those opportunities. We are halfway through our big fix initiative, which is designed to bring our restaurants back up to standards and make them uniquely Chipotle. This not only improves the guest experience, as the appearance of our restaurants is clean and well maintained for every guest, but the team member experience improves as well. \nWe overhauled our training materials several months ago and have retrained 3/4 of our field leaders through Cultivate University. That's an in-restaurant and in-classroom 1-week training session that we launched in April. That investment and the ongoing development of our field leadership continue to drive crew member engagement. We are supplementing that training with a new hospitality training program in the restaurants, and we're in the early innings of refining our training to teach and taste the details, so that we achieve the winning combination of great food, feel and flow with every guest experience. \nWe are zeroing in on how to get back to great throughput, as speed of service is a foundational element of convenience that our guests truly value. Late last year, we rolled out what we call the owner's path, a comprehensive review of our restaurant's performance. Equipping our field leaders with this tool is improving their powers of observation and allowing them to focus on the critical details of delivering an improved guest experience. In addition, the tool creates teaching moments for their general managers and documents that corrective actions are taken when needed. We're currently rolling out a digital version for mobile phones and tablets of this previous paper-based tool. That should result in more consistent operations across our restaurants. We'll have this in place nationally by October. \nWe're also in the process of redesigning our forecasting and labor scheduling tool. This is a significant undertaking but necessary for us to have accurate sales forecasting and deliver the right amount of labor at the right time to meet the needs of our guests. \nThe new tool will have a best-in-class sales forecasting component that will leverage machine learning to remove the guesswork of determining sales and labor needs for our business. In addition, our team members will have the ability to see their schedules remotely and swap shifts from mobile phones, taking these tasks out of the hands of the manager. We believe leveraging technologies such as this makes us a more desirable employer as we work to create a better experience for our crew members. We will continue to make investments in our restaurants because a better experience for our team members directly translates to a better experience for our guests. \nI'd also like to talk to you about the progress we are making around innovation in digital and access, as this was a real bright spot in the quarter. Today, our annualized digital sales are approximately $0.5 billion, and we are in the early stages of this multibillion-dollar opportunity. Our digital sales grew 33% in the quarter and now account for 10.3% of sales, an acceleration from 20% growth in the first quarter. \nWe now have 4 million active monthly users across our app and our website, a 65% increase since the end of last year. Delivery and group occasions were particularly strong this quarter. Delivery sales quadrupled in the quarter and we know from our customer research that improving access to Chipotle is an important growth lever, whether it be through adding more restaurants or enabling more convenience like delivery. \nToday, delivery is available from 1,700 restaurants and we expect that to reach 2,000 restaurants by year-end. We're also pleased that delivery is now an option available directly from our app. \nOur group ordering business was solid in the seasonally strong quarter for catering orders. In mid-July, we expanded our build-your-own catering offer nationally, whereby we lowered the minimum size and offered more price tiers for group orders therefore expanding access for more occasions. We tested this enhancement early in the year and found that group order sales in our test stores outperformed the base by mid to high single digits. \nDelivery availability for catering expanded to 2/3 of our restaurants in the quarter. As I have mentioned, Chipotle's second make-line enables the business to handle the incremental growth without any impact on throughput or the in-restaurant experience. I'm happy to see progress on  digitizing our second make-lines, which are now in roughly 500 restaurants. We're targeting approximately 1,000 restaurants to be enabled with a digital second make-line by year-end, and we are accelerating our rollout to reach completion by the end of 2019. \nThese digital second make-lines have a direct positive impact on the team member and guest experience. Also, the digital pickup-shelf test in several New York City restaurants continues to show great promise. And based on the results to date, we will be expanding the test to a larger number of restaurants in several markets next month. \nWe've mentioned before that we are undertaking a wide-ranging consumer research project, with the results available this fall. I did, however, want to mention a few interesting highlights that we've uncovered so far. Access is the #1 lever we can pull to drive sales, which supports our new unit growth as well as the innovation focus around the access via our digital channels. Additionally, we sit at in an interesting intersection between fast food and fast casual, with many attributes such as value and speed that are typically associated with fast food and attributes such as quality and freshness, which are typically associated with fast-casual. \nWe're particularly strong with millennial and Generation Z customers relative to most brands. And when these groups try us, our odds of repeat visits are much higher. These early insights give us confidence that new news and the more engaging marketing that we're beginning to see will allow us to drive transaction growth. Also, I'm pleased with the speed at which we are getting transaction-driving initiatives across digital, access, loyalty and menu into test markets. \nThe combination of these test markets and our early insights from our consumer research will inform our plans in 2019 and beyond. \nBefore I turn it over to Jack, I want to thank all of our team members across the country that are working diligently to serve our guests real food, cooked to perfection and prepared in our restaurants with fresh ingredients, just the way our guests like it. This hard work is the basis for all of our future success, and we appreciate it tremendously. \nNow over to you, Jack.\nExecutives: Thanks, Brian. I'm really pleased that our team's focus on our 5 strategic priorities has contributed to a high-quality quarter with comp sales of 3.3% and a 19.7% restaurant-level margin. And underlying earnings were also strong after adjusting for a number of unusual costs during the quarter. As we discussed on our call last month, we'll continue to see costs over the next few quarters associated with our restructuring, relocation and underperforming store closures. These charges also have a temporary impact on our tax rates, which I'll talk about in more detail later. \nWe generated revenue of $1.27 billion during the quarter, an increase of 8.3% from last year on comp sales growth of 3.3%. That's on top of last year's strong 8.1% Q2 comp sales increase. \nRestaurant-level margins of 19.7% expanded 90 basis points from last year, and normalized earnings per share adjusted for the unusual items was $2.87. \nThe second quarter had unusual expenses mostly related to the transformation, and that negatively impacted EPS by about $1.19, leading to a GAAP earnings per share of $1.68. In Q2, we expensed about $25 million in expenses related to restaurant asset write-offs, approximately $16.5 million related to office closures and $7 million related to the restructure of our organization and other unusual expenses. These charges were offset by a nonrecurring benefit of about $6.5 million related to lower stock comp expense as a result of the restructure. As a result of these transformation expenses, our tax rate increased about 400 basis points, which I'll explain later. \nThe Q2 comp of 3.3% was primarily driven by higher average checks due to the price increases taken over the last year as well as queso add-ons. Price increase averaged about 4% in the quarter, and customer resistance to the price increase remains at or below 20%. \nThe menu price impact was lower than Q1 as we lapped the first increase from April of last year in about 20% of our restaurants. Sales trends in the first 3 weeks of July continue to mirror what we saw in Q2, with the comp increasing over the last week or so as we've begun to compare against those softer trends from last year. \nSo overall, comps should improve from the 3.3% in Q2. However, keep in mind that comparisons will get tougher later in Q3 as we lap the introduction of queso in early September, which initially added about 3.5% to the comp before settling into a sustained benefit to the average check of about 2%. And in November, we will lap the price increase in about 1,000 restaurants, which added an additional 1.3% prorated impact to the comp. \nBased on second quarter results and expected improvement in the Q3 comp, we're increasing our full year comp sales guidance from low single digits to a low to mid-single-digit comp range. \nWe opened 34 new restaurants in the quarter and expect to be at the lower end of our 130 to 150 new opening guidance for the full year. While we're still building inventory for next year's openings, we continue to expect 2019 openings will be at or above the 2018 levels. \nOur new restaurants this year have opened strong, and we're continuing to emphasize high-quality, high-returning new restaurants as we build out our pipeline. \nAs mentioned on our last call, we expect to close between 55 and 65 underperforming restaurants. And today, we're closing 29 Chipotle restaurants. \nDuring the second quarter, we closed 5 Pizzeria Locales in Kansas and Ohio, and we also closed 3 Chipotle restaurants, including one relocation. So with today's closures about half of the underperforming restaurants have now closed. \nFood cost for the quarter were 32.6%, a decrease of 150 basis points from the 34.1% in Q2 of last year. The decrease from last year was driven by the menu price increase and more favorable avocado prices. The decreases were slightly offset by elevated prices for our steak and barbacoa. We expect food cost increase to the low 33% range in Q3 due to the seasonal shift to source higher cost avocados from California and an uptick in paper and packaging costs. We expect to be closer to the 33% in Q4 as we begin to shift the supply of avocados back to Mexico. \nLabor costs for the quarter were 27%, an increase of 80 basis points from the 26.2% in Q2 of last year. The increase from last year was driven primarily from wage inflation of about 6% and increased restaurant manager bonus costs as we returned to normalized bonus payouts, rewarding our managers for delivering strong results. \nThese increases were offset by leverage from the menu price increase. We expect labor costs to increase to the high 27% range in Q3 and to the mid-28% range in Q4, and these increases are driven primarily by seasonally lower sales in Q3 and Q4 and by general wage pressures. \nOccupancy costs for the quarter were 6.9%, which is flat with last year. Other operating costs for the quarter were 13.8%, a decrease of 20 basis points from Q2 of last year. \nOur marketing and promo costs were 3.2% in the quarter, a decrease of about 40 basis points compared to Q2 of last year. We expect marketing and promo costs to be at or slightly above 3% of sales for the full year, with elevated spending continuing in Q3 and Q4. \nOther operating costs continue to include about 30 basis points of higher maintenance and repair costs, which we first discussed on our Q4 call, and we expect M&R to continue at this elevated level for the rest of the year. \nG&A in the quarter increased by $8 million compared to Q1 of this year. The increase compared to last quarter was primarily due to the stock comp forfeitures and the timing of the 2018 equity grant that we discussed on the last earnings call. \nAnd as I mentioned earlier, G&A also included $7 million in charges related to the restructuring and additional unusual charges in the quarter, but those were offset by a $6.5 million nonrecurring benefit related to revising our estimates of forfeitures related to stock grants for employees expected to leave the company. \nThe G&A increase compared to Q2 of last year was primarily in support of our restaurant growth, digitizing our restaurant experience and operational leadership changes in the field. \nDepreciation expense for the quarter was 3.9%, an increase of 40 basis points from the 3.5% in Q2 of last year. This increase is due to the accelerated depreciation for items we're replacing related to the maintenance and repair refresh as well as capital initiatives that we described on our Q4 call. We expect the increase related to the refresh to fall off in the second half of the year. \nHowever, it will be replaced by accelerated depreciation from the restaurant closures we detailed earlier. As a result, we expect depreciation to remain at this elevated level for the rest of this year. \nOur pretax income was $70 million and our reported effective tax rate was 33.3%. Our tax rate was higher than the 29% underlying rate we discussed on our last earnings call and is a direct result of the $42 million in unusual expenses this quarter. \nWithout these charges, our tax rate would have been right around a 28.5% effective rate, and we expect to return to a roughly 29% rate next year when the transformation charges are fully behind us. This underlying rate of about 29% may be affected in future years by stock comp vesting and exercises when the benefit realized by our employees varies from our accounting treatment, and we'll fully call out these impacts as they occur. \nWe continue to expect the transformation costs from the restructuring, restaurant closures and other unusual costs will total between $115 million and $135 million, with most of that amount hitting in 2018. We estimate that about $50 million to $55 million will hit in Q3, with most of the remainder in Q4. There will likely be some charges related to terminating restaurant and office leases that will spill into 2019. \nWe'll also write off about $10 million in deferred tax assets beginning in Q4, with most hitting in 2019 as fully vested but underwater options will likely expire as we complete the restructure of the organization. \nIn Q3, we expect our effective tax rate to be right around 30.3% or about 130 basis points higher than we guided last quarter. In Q4, we expect our tax rate to be as high as 43% or about 450 basis points higher than we guided last quarter. Both of these increases are due to a lower pretax income as a result of the transformation expenses. \nAs mentioned during our Q1 call, our Q4 rate is impacted by performance shares that will likely expire in that period because the performance shares will only vest if the stock price is over $700. We took deductions on these performance shares over the years but if they prove worthless, we won't get a tax benefit contributing to the estimated 43% tax rate. \nWe'll continue to provide more specifics on future transformation-related costs when we have more certainty around the timing, and we will continue to break out the unusual costs from normal costs so you can follow the underlying trends. \nWe're encouraged by our second quarter results and the contributions of our restaurant teams to deliver an excellent guest experience. We're also encouraged by our guest response to our digital initiative so far, along with a solid sales and restaurant-level margin performance during the quarter. We're confident that significant changes we're making to our organization will enable us to continue to improve operational excellence in our restaurants, to be more nimble and innovative in digital, access, menu and the restaurant environment, and to execute better to deliver on our commitments to our guests, our employees and our shareholders. And now, we're happy to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Sara Senatore with Bernstein.\nAnalysts: Just on the 2Q, the implication is with 4 points of price, I think that you saw some negative traffic. And I guess, how do you turn that around? And in particular, you talked about really a lot of growth in digital usage. But do you think you're substituting -- just substituting from walk-in orders or can you actually tell that these orders are incremental? And are you starting to build a database of your customers that might allow for better targeted marketing?\nExecutives: Yes. Thanks for the question. Obviously, I think I may have mentioned in my early remarks, a lot of our new transaction-driving initiatives are getting ready to head to pilot, and we also are working on some new marketing communication as well. So I think as those things start to enter markets and then we gain learnings on how to improve those programs and then plan for national execution, the goal is to use the staged-gate process then to inform what our sales and transaction performance can be going forward. The good news is our price increase that we passed through has passed through nicely. We're not seeing customer counts retreat versus anything we've seen historically when we take pricing. I mean, regarding your question on digital sales, obviously, there's multiple elements to that, right? There's the delivery aspect, there's our catering, and then there's also the app or website orders. And we see varying degrees of incrementality across each of those spaces. The thing that we do know, though, is when we get a digital order through that second make-line, the economics of that order are very attractive, and then our customer satisfaction scores also are very attractive. So we've continued to see improvements on accuracy and speed at which we're getting people the food they want, when they want, where they want it. So still a lot to learn. And actually, when we get the pilot going on our loyalty program, I think that's going to give us another level of insight and understanding on exactly how all these transactions are interacting with each other. And that's a new skill we're going to be building for the organization going forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Tarantino.\nAnalysts: Just maybe a clarification question on the comps for the quarter. Could you maybe explain how the trend transpired as the quarter progressed? It sounded as if, on the last call, you might have started a little slow and then maybe picked up later in the quarter. But is that accurate? Or how should we think about that?\nExecutives: Yes, David. I think that is accurate. We talked on the last call that in April, because of weather and the seasonal shift of Easter, that we got off to a slow start. May was a great month for us, that's when we had the DoorDash promotion, so May looked great. And then June settled in right at about the overall average for the month. So I would say, the overall comp of 3.3% is a good kind of gauge for what the underlying trend was. A little less in April, more in May but then we settled out right in the middle in June. And so, we feel good about the way that we ended the quarter and how we're entering the third quarter now.\nAnalysts: Great. That's helpful. And then, I guess, Jack or Brian, that does suggest a little bit of underlying improvement in at least the way we look at the business on a sequential basis on traffic. So could you maybe talk about what you think drove that improvement, whether it was the operations improvements you talked about? And then on the operations improvements in particular, is there any sort of deeper look at that data that would suggest that's moving the needle as you kind of split the restaurants that are doing the best from the worst apart from one another?\nExecutives: Yes. Look, I don't think it was just one thing. The good news is though, as I've mentioned earlier, we've seen improvement in our operations on all the key metrics. And we continue to hear more and more positive customer feedback on their experiences and fewer -- or a reduction in customer complaints. And we believe there's even more opportunity for us to get even better on throughput going forward. So we're pleased with the progress we're making on ops. We also saw in the quarter, people really responded positively to the advertising that we put out there. And then obviously, we've seen very positive responses to varying elements of our digital program. So I think it was a combination of multiple things, not one thing that drove it. And that's what has us excited about how we're moving forward with all the pilots across the business. We're making progress, I think, on ops, we're making progress on digital, and we're making progress on really understanding our customer base better. So that, you know what, we get the brands the right message, then with the right food at the right place with the right value, I think we'll continue to see improvement in our performance.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nicole Miller with Piper Jaffray.\nAnalysts: Culture of accountability. Could you talk a little bit more about maybe how it's changed to work in the store day-to-day? And how are you aligning that with incentives to have the employees make these changes?\nExecutives: Nicole, I think we missed the first part of your question. Could you just start from the beginning?\nAnalysts: Absolutely. So asking about the culture of accountability, and I thought it was helpful how you talked about how that translated to the customer engagement or improved guest satisfaction. So what I'm wondering is from the employee perspective, in that store, how is it different to work there today than before? And what are the incentives that you have put in place to keep them aligned with your culture of accountability?\nExecutives: Yes. Thanks for the question. Obviously, one of the things that I think Scott's done a nice job in the field is the accountability is both on developing a great team as well as being accountable to providing a great experience for the customer. So I think we're starting to see our teams being more staffed correctly, engaged at another level than where they had been over the last couple years, and everybody has clarity on what their role is on the team. And I think we've talked about this in the past, but we've given everybody their kind of top 5 responsibilities, which then gives the team the ability to trust that each other is going to be doing what they need to do for them to be successful. And then to your question on incentives, yes, we've moved to some quarterly bonus programs and we've seen that actually have a material impact on our employee satisfaction with -- when they make great progress then they get rewarded much closer to when they have that success. So I think it's the combination really of making sure that we're holding ourselves accountable to a great experience but also holding ourselves accountable to develop a great team and then obviously rewarding them when they have successes.\nAnalysts: And then just a final question. When you think about the structural framework previously of a $2 million AUV translating loosely to a 20% store-level margin, you're doing that yet you have over 3 percentage points of marketing that is at least twice as much as what it had been historically. So it seems that there might be more leverage in the model. Is there any kind of framework you could give or update for us to think about as we model going forward?\nExecutives: Nicole, we've also got M&R just a little high as well. So I mean, the results we're seeing in the last couple of quarters give us even more confidence that the model, at $2 million, gets you right about in that high teens to 20% margin. And as we grow the volume from there, we think we can move back up into the 20-plus percent margin. So the things that we thought the model can do, I think we're starting to see that they're coming to [ life ].\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets.\nAnalysts: Brian, you mentioned some statistics earlier about how the fast-casual occasion, perhaps, overlaps with that of fast food in some ways with younger generations and that trial seems to be important with these consumers. I'm trying to understand what you're seeing and saying about the opportunity there. In the past, I think Chipotle tried to get trial going, coupons and the like, with this understanding that if you get trial, they'll come back. But how are you thinking about marketing perhaps different than that and using the data you're seeing?\nExecutives: Sure, yes. So I think I mentioned this in our call a couple weeks ago. We've got a big foundational consumer study out, and we're starting to get some top lines in. And what we have definitely seen is when people try the brand and have a positive experience with it, their intent to stay with the brand is much higher than a lot of our competitors in both fast-casual as well as fast food. And it's very exciting because when we look at younger people, we get an even more positive response to intent and then intent to stay with us. So that's what I was referencing. And then the brand, obviously, I think we all instinctually see this as very much a purpose-driven brand that syncs up nicely with Gen Z and millennials, and we're seeing that play out in our research as well. So we're going to want to continue to build on that strength as we move forward.\nAnalysts: And Jack, you mentioned the restructuring expense that you expect. I know it's not typical, necessarily, in the sector, but could you talk about the dollar savings you anticipate or maybe the return on investment from these store closures and restructuring expenses and the timing of that? Any color would be helpful.\nExecutives: Yes, David. On the restaurants we're closing, these are all cash flow-losing restaurants. We've got about half of them closed right now. So it's going to take -- before we can see the full effect, we're going to have to have them all closed. But we should pick up somewhere in the 20, 30 basis points of margin once they're all closed. So there's a definite improvement in our margin returns from that standpoint. Most of the other costs, that's more with restructuring the organization. There's going to be return on that. It's not going to be as black and white or linear. The return is going to be on having a culture that's more innovative, a culture that's more results-oriented. And we think there's going to be lots and lots of benefits there, but it's going to be less of a cause and effect where we can tell you what the actual return is.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Karen Holthouse with Goldman Sachs.\nAnalysts: This is actually Jared on for Karen. Can you guys give us a sense of maybe delivery as a percent of your total sales at this point, and maybe just some context about how delivery is contributing to a stronger comp in 2Q versus 3Q?\nExecutives: Yes, delivery is a piece of that 10% number that I mentioned earlier on our digital sales. And what we're seeing is, today, we're in 1,700 restaurants, we'll be expanding to closer to 2,000 here shortly. Really, the delivery performance, not surprising, right now, what we're seeing is it really is impacted by how we promote it, because we're in the early days of getting people to even understand that it's available. I think, the last number I saw, we still have over 50% of customers not realizing Chipotle is available for delivery. So we're seeing some variability in the delivery performance based on how we promote with these partners. The thing that is exciting though is we are seeing, when we get that bump, we don't fall below where we were. So we're continuing to see progress. And I think, over time, as we build awareness, build a habit, I think we'll see this play a bigger and bigger role in getting us into an off-premise occasion.\nAnalysts: And if I could just follow up with one more. Have you guys seen any learnings early on the new menu test items that you have in tests right now?\nExecutives: Sure. I think I mentioned this earlier. We're actually -- you've seen the products in our NEXT Kitchen where that's really just for us to look at operational execution. And we're just getting ready to use our staged-gate process to move a handful of initiatives into an actual test market, where we'll be at scale, where we'll start to really have true learnings of customer experience, team member experience and then how that plays out on total Chipotle performance. So too early to comment on any of those items right now.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andy Barish with Jefferies.\nAnalysts: Two things just on -- can you help us understand as you start to lap, I think you mentioned, Jack, the July issues last year in Virginia, just how we should think about that maybe 500 or 600 basis points decline in traffic kind of coming back?\nExecutives: Yes, Andy. There's a couple things going on right now. We're also comparing against, right now, SAVOR.WAVS. So we did see a nice uptick in a comp in the last week or so as we compare it to the soft sales from last year. But SAVOR.WAVS happened as well, which there was a big BOGO, a lot of buy one, get one. And so, that's creating a little bit of noise, but we do expect to see much more attractive traffic and much more attractive sales comps over the next several weeks. And that'll only be slowed a bit as we compare to the launch of queso last year, which I talked about in my prepared comments. So yes, we're already seeing the positive effect from the comparisons to last year -- to the softness from last year.\nAnalysts: Got you. And then anything on sort of pricing as you do the research on the brand, the ability to be a more regular menu price increase taker instead of every several years as has been the case in the past?\nExecutives: Yes. So one of the things we're definitely looking to understand is exactly the health over value equation. The good news is, our value continues to be very strong. And what we're assessing right now is what is the right approach to sequencing pricing over time, making sure we don't ever get ahead of a great value equation? So that's part of the consumer research, frankly, that we've got going on right now. As we get those learnings back, it we will inform how we approach pricing going forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays.\nAnalysts: This is actually Jeff Priester on for Jeff Bernstein. Operationally, given all these initiatives, including your potential new items coming from the NEXT Kitchen, and I know, in New York, some of the pickup shelves around the end of your actual make-line, is there going to be an issue down the line where implementing some of these initiatives where you need to expand the line or reorganize it to get some of these things out there? And then I have one follow-up.\nExecutives: Yes, sure. So I think I've mentioned this before. Obviously, everything we're looking at has to be thoughtfully executed so that the throughput engine of Chipotle is not jeopardized. And I think I mentioned this earlier, there's some projects that frankly, just are a bolt-on. So like a digital-shelf pickup, that actually improves the customer experience and the team member experience because it illuminates that confusion for where the mobile order person is supposed to go, that awkward moment at the cashier, it eliminates a lot of that. So that, in our opinion, is a throughput enabler because 2 things happen. One, it merchandises the fact that you can do this mobile ordering and not have to go through the line. And then the second piece is it really takes advantage of our second make-line, which is, I think, a huge advantage to open up an off-premise business. But look, the varying initiatives, if it comes with needs for new equipment, we'll test out the new equipment and make sure that it works and plays nicely with the throughput engine that we have. If it doesn't, then that's why we use the staged-gate process to learn and figure out how we try again. And it's going to be an [ intricate ] process with us, so I'm very excited that we're going to start the process of seeing some of these pilots get into market, so that we protect the integrity of what's made Chipotle great, while we figure out how we enhance relevance and dial up engagement.\nAnalysts: Great. And then on delivery, can you give us a sense of the average check you're seeing relative to your dining customer and then, as well as the number of customers per order, the number of entrées per order, however you want to approach it?\nExecutives: Yes, I mean, we see obviously, a nice increase in our digital orders. So the mobile and delivery orders are in that $16 to $17 range versus our traditional check is in the $12 range. And we're still learning, frankly, what is the order size that comes with it versus additional attachments like chips and guac and queso and so on and so forth. But we're really seeing a blend, right now, of both there are times we see more add-ons and then there are times where clearly it's a larger group occasion that's off-premise that's ordering through the app or through the delivery third party.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.\nAnalysts: This Brandon on for John. I believe on the first quarter call, you mentioned that you expected marketing and promo to be elevated throughout the remainder of the year. Do you still expect that to play out throughout the back half of '18 here?\nExecutives: Yes, we were -- it will be a little elevated. We were light in the first quarter, we were at 3.2% this past quarter, and we'll be right at about that same 3.2%. So overall for the year, we'll average right at about 3% for the overall year.\nAnalysts: Got it, okay. And then I just had a follow up. You mentioned in your prepared remarks, the restaurant AB and guest sat scores are beginning to trend in the right direction. Could you elaborate on that comment and maybe quantify some of those improvements?\nExecutives: Yes. So the restaurant AB is the measurement tool that we use that's a couple of metrics that are very important to us that cover financials, people, guest experience and the team, okay? And what we're happy to see is we're seeing a nice move from Bs to As, and that's a good sign. So it's a very important metric, it's one that Scott keeps a laser eye on, and it's a good way for us to understand how we're performing in our restaurants and how we're actually making progress.\nOperator: Our final question comes from the line of Jake Bartlett with SunTrust.\nAnalysts: Great. First, I just wanted to get a sense for how much of the initiatives are driving or how much the improved outlook in the back is driven by the initiatives or driven by the easy to compares? And I know in terms of the initiatives, there's a lot of unknown timing. But maybe you can talk about what you do know. For instance, I believe when you get your study back on the consumer, that's going to be the source of a new advertising campaign, maybe some impact of the change in the new catering menu. I'm thinking about the shelf rollout. You just mentioned how kind of a no-brainer it is. I mean, is that really a test that's going on or is that just kind of a -- I mean, should we expect that to be rolled out here in the back half?\nExecutives: You know what, I didn't hear the last part of your question, but let me answer the first part, which is, as we've talked about our guidance, it's got very -- it's got nearly 0 on the initiatives that we've been talking about that we are putting into pilot and that we're going to start expanding over the course of the year. So what we're seeing right now, I think is what I mentioned earlier, which is I think we're seeing a nice improvement in our operational performance. I think we've got more visible, more effective, more relevant marketing out there, and I think we've done a nice job of expanding access through our digital efforts. I think it's going to continue to be the combination of all those things plus, as we get some learning on loyalty and potentially some new menus items down the road, that we'll see initiatives play then, hopefully, a bigger role going forward. But as of right now, there's -- I think it's very minimal. And what was the second part of your question?\nAnalysts: The second part was just your initiatives like the digital -- like, the shelves, the pickup shelves. You mentioned a kind of it's a no-brainer operationally. I mean, what is the [ optional ] to just kind of rolling that out and not considering it a test but kind of just seeing a roll out. What is there to test with that?\nExecutives: Yes. So look, I think, as an organization, we're going to be a test-and-learn organization before we go launch. And even though going into, where we've put it in these 5 stores, our early indications were it's a no-brainer. The good news is in the first 5 stores, it went as we had hoped. And as a result, we're expanding now to 4 or 5 markets in very short order. And then the goal is, assuming we continue to see the positive performance, we'll get it across the system in very short order thereafter.\nAnalysts: Great. And Jack, a clarification on the tax guidance. I'm just looking, if I think about adjusted earnings comparable to the $2.87 that you mentioned today, I look at the adjusted tax rate there, and it's 28.5% is my estimate. So when you think about the third quarter effective tax rate that you've mentioned in the fourth quarter, is that more relevant to GAAP earnings? Or is that relevant to the adjusted earnings we might be focused on?\nExecutives: Those rates are more GAAP earnings. The underlying rates are going to be more similar to what we talked about on our last call. So the higher tax rates that you're seeing this time compared to what we talked about on our first quarter call are directly attributable to the fact that we've got all these charges. It's just pushing our income down, and so it ends up pushing our rates up. When we normalize our earnings, like for example in this quarter, our normal tax rate would be in that 28.5% range.\nAnalysts: Got it. And then last question, just because I think there is some confusion around depreciation as I look at different estimates, a fairly wide range. Could you help us understand what is accelerated depreciation in 2018 and will not kind of recur in '19? And maybe whether you think that depreciation as a whole would be potentially less in '19 than the '18 overall.\nExecutives: Yes, '19 will definitely be less. We're at a higher level this year, call it 30 basis points or so. That's due to 2 things. One is due to retiring assets as a result of our refresh. We're investing in operating our restaurants, so that requires accelerated depreciation on the items that are going to be taken out of the restaurant. And then secondly, part of the restaurants that haven't closed yet, we leave a little bit on the books. GAAP requires that you leave a little bit of the asset on the books and then you write that off over the remaining time that you expect that restaurant to be open. And so as the M&R that we're doing, the refresh that we're doing, as that depreciation levels off, that'll be replaced by this higher depreciation from the stores that we're going to close, but that should fall off. Most of it should fall off this year, maybe into early next year, and then our depreciation should go to more the normal historical rates.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of our question-and-answer session, and I would like to turn the call back over to Chipotle CEO, Brian Niccol, for closing remarks.\nExecutives: Okay. Well, thank you, everybody. I know this is a busy earnings time, so I appreciate everybody taking the time to listen to our results and have a discussion of the business. And thanks again, and I'm sure we'll be in touch. Take care.\nOperator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.\nOperator: Greetings, and welcome to Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. \nI would now like to turn the conference over to Chipotle. Please go ahead.\nExecutives: Hi, everyone, and welcome to our call today. By now, you should have access to our earnings announcement released this afternoon for the second quarter of 2018. It may also be found on our Investor Relations website at ir.chipotle.com.\nBefore we begin our presentation, I will remind everyone that parts of our discussion today will include forward-looking statements as defined in the securities laws. These forward-looking statements will include statements regarding the expected benefits from our strategic focus areas or specific business initiatives; the potential opportunity for our digital sales; sales trends and forecasts for future comparable sales; expected new restaurant openings; estimates of future food, labor, marketing and maintenance and repair costs; statements about our expected effective tax rate and projections of the amount and timing of unusual cost items and stock repurchases as well as other statements of our expectations and plans. These statements are based on information available to us today, and we are not assuming any obligation to update them.\nForward-looking statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. We refer you to the risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K, as updated, and our subsequent Form 10-Qs for a discussion of these risks. Our discussion today will also include non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations of which can be found on the Presentation page of the Investor Relations section of our website. I'd also like to remind everyone that we've adopted a self-imposed quiet period, restricting communications with investors during that period. The quiet period will begin on the 16th day of the last month of each fiscal quarter and continues until the next earnings conference call.\nFor the third quarter of 2018, it will begin September 16 and continue through our third quarter earnings release. We will start today's call with some prepared remarks from Brian Niccol, Chief Executive Officer; and Jack Hartung, Chief Financial Officer. After which, we will take questions. In the room and also available during the Q&A period are Scott Boatwright, Chief Restaurant Officer; Curt Garner, Chief Digital and Information Officer; Chris Brandt, Chief Marketing Officer; Laurie Schalow, Chief Communications Officer; and Marissa Andrada, Chief Human Resources Officer. \nAnd now, I will turn the call over to Brian Niccol.\nExecutives: Thanks, Coralie, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report a solid second quarter with sales and restaurant-level margins ahead of our expectations. \nTotal sales grew 8.3% to $1.27 billion, driven by comparable sales of 3.3% and 34 new restaurants opened in the quarter. This positive comparable sales trajectory enabled us to expand restaurant-level margins, which were up 90 basis points year-over-year to 19.7%. Earnings per share adjusted for unusual costs grew nearly 24% to $2.87, and our GAAP earnings were $1.68. \nWhile Jack will go through the financials in more detail shortly, I'd like to put these results into context by discussing how the work our 70,000 employees do every day contributed to these financial outcomes. \nLast month, we shared with you that we would execute our strategy to win today and cultivate the future by focusing on these 5 areas: becoming a more culturally relevant and engaging brand that builds love and loyalty; digitizing and modernizing our restaurant experience to create a more convenient and enjoyable guest experience; running great restaurants with great hospitality and throughput; being disciplined and focused to enhance our powerful economic model; and building a great culture that can innovate and execute across digital, access, menu and the restaurant experience. \nToday, I'll focus on how innovation in digital and access and how improving our operations contributed to this quarter's results. Let me begin with operations. \nWe know that strong sales growth and margins are dependent on great operations, which is the hallmark of any healthy brand. This brand was founded on outstanding operations and real food. We are getting back to our roots. When we have the right people leading the right teams and when those teams are well trained and operating with confidence, they execute great guest experiences. \nIt takes time to build a culture of accountability, and I'm pleased that we are seeing some encouraging signs of progress in key areas, namely, our restaurant AB scores, a measurement system we implemented 1.5 years ago to drive greater accountability, is trending in the right direction. We are doing a better job staffing our restaurants to match sales volumes, and we have lower year-over-year hourly turnover, which tells us we are making progress on training and building great teams. \nAdditionally, we have seen a meaningful decline in guest complaints, and with that, our guest satisfaction scores have improved since we started measuring them last year. This tells us that we've made progress and that our guests are noticing the difference. We know that when the food is delicious, the feel of the restaurant is great, and we remove the friction from the flow of the order process, no matter the channel, we delight customers.\nWhile I'm encouraged by our progress, we still have a lot of work to do. We have an opportunity to improve throughput, consistent execution of great food and consistent delivery of a great atmosphere. I'll outline some of the initiatives underway to address those opportunities. We are halfway through our big fix initiative, which is designed to bring our restaurants back up to standards and make them uniquely Chipotle. This not only improves the guest experience, as the appearance of our restaurants is clean and well maintained for every guest, but the team member experience improves as well. \nWe overhauled our training materials several months ago and have retrained 3/4 of our field leaders through Cultivate University. That's an in-restaurant and in-classroom 1-week training session that we launched in April. That investment and the ongoing development of our field leadership continue to drive crew member engagement. We are supplementing that training with a new hospitality training program in the restaurants, and we're in the early innings of refining our training to teach and taste the details, so that we achieve the winning combination of great food, feel and flow with every guest experience. \nWe are zeroing in on how to get back to great throughput, as speed of service is a foundational element of convenience that our guests truly value. Late last year, we rolled out what we call the owner's path, a comprehensive review of our restaurant's performance. Equipping our field leaders with this tool is improving their powers of observation and allowing them to focus on the critical details of delivering an improved guest experience. In addition, the tool creates teaching moments for their general managers and documents that corrective actions are taken when needed. We're currently rolling out a digital version for mobile phones and tablets of this previous paper-based tool. That should result in more consistent operations across our restaurants. We'll have this in place nationally by October. \nWe're also in the process of redesigning our forecasting and labor scheduling tool. This is a significant undertaking but necessary for us to have accurate sales forecasting and deliver the right amount of labor at the right time to meet the needs of our guests. \nThe new tool will have a best-in-class sales forecasting component that will leverage machine learning to remove the guesswork of determining sales and labor needs for our business. In addition, our team members will have the ability to see their schedules remotely and swap shifts from mobile phones, taking these tasks out of the hands of the manager. We believe leveraging technologies such as this makes us a more desirable employer as we work to create a better experience for our crew members. We will continue to make investments in our restaurants because a better experience for our team members directly translates to a better experience for our guests. \nI'd also like to talk to you about the progress we are making around innovation in digital and access, as this was a real bright spot in the quarter. Today, our annualized digital sales are approximately $0.5 billion, and we are in the early stages of this multibillion-dollar opportunity. Our digital sales grew 33% in the quarter and now account for 10.3% of sales, an acceleration from 20% growth in the first quarter. \nWe now have 4 million active monthly users across our app and our website, a 65% increase since the end of last year. Delivery and group occasions were particularly strong this quarter. Delivery sales quadrupled in the quarter and we know from our customer research that improving access to Chipotle is an important growth lever, whether it be through adding more restaurants or enabling more convenience like delivery. \nToday, delivery is available from 1,700 restaurants and we expect that to reach 2,000 restaurants by year-end. We're also pleased that delivery is now an option available directly from our app. \nOur group ordering business was solid in the seasonally strong quarter for catering orders. In mid-July, we expanded our build-your-own catering offer nationally, whereby we lowered the minimum size and offered more price tiers for group orders therefore expanding access for more occasions. We tested this enhancement early in the year and found that group order sales in our test stores outperformed the base by mid to high single digits. \nDelivery availability for catering expanded to 2/3 of our restaurants in the quarter. As I have mentioned, Chipotle's second make-line enables the business to handle the incremental growth without any impact on throughput or the in-restaurant experience. I'm happy to see progress on  digitizing our second make-lines, which are now in roughly 500 restaurants. We're targeting approximately 1,000 restaurants to be enabled with a digital second make-line by year-end, and we are accelerating our rollout to reach completion by the end of 2019. \nThese digital second make-lines have a direct positive impact on the team member and guest experience. Also, the digital pickup-shelf test in several New York City restaurants continues to show great promise. And based on the results to date, we will be expanding the test to a larger number of restaurants in several markets next month. \nWe've mentioned before that we are undertaking a wide-ranging consumer research project, with the results available this fall. I did, however, want to mention a few interesting highlights that we've uncovered so far. Access is the #1 lever we can pull to drive sales, which supports our new unit growth as well as the innovation focus around the access via our digital channels. Additionally, we sit at in an interesting intersection between fast food and fast casual, with many attributes such as value and speed that are typically associated with fast food and attributes such as quality and freshness, which are typically associated with fast-casual. \nWe're particularly strong with millennial and Generation Z customers relative to most brands. And when these groups try us, our odds of repeat visits are much higher. These early insights give us confidence that new news and the more engaging marketing that we're beginning to see will allow us to drive transaction growth. Also, I'm pleased with the speed at which we are getting transaction-driving initiatives across digital, access, loyalty and menu into test markets. \nThe combination of these test markets and our early insights from our consumer research will inform our plans in 2019 and beyond. \nBefore I turn it over to Jack, I want to thank all of our team members across the country that are working diligently to serve our guests real food, cooked to perfection and prepared in our restaurants with fresh ingredients, just the way our guests like it. This hard work is the basis for all of our future success, and we appreciate it tremendously. \nNow over to you, Jack.\nExecutives: Thanks, Brian. I'm really pleased that our team's focus on our 5 strategic priorities has contributed to a high-quality quarter with comp sales of 3.3% and a 19.7% restaurant-level margin. And underlying earnings were also strong after adjusting for a number of unusual costs during the quarter. As we discussed on our call last month, we'll continue to see costs over the next few quarters associated with our restructuring, relocation and underperforming store closures. These charges also have a temporary impact on our tax rates, which I'll talk about in more detail later. \nWe generated revenue of $1.27 billion during the quarter, an increase of 8.3% from last year on comp sales growth of 3.3%. That's on top of last year's strong 8.1% Q2 comp sales increase. \nRestaurant-level margins of 19.7% expanded 90 basis points from last year, and normalized earnings per share adjusted for the unusual items was $2.87. \nThe second quarter had unusual expenses mostly related to the transformation, and that negatively impacted EPS by about $1.19, leading to a GAAP earnings per share of $1.68. In Q2, we expensed about $25 million in expenses related to restaurant asset write-offs, approximately $16.5 million related to office closures and $7 million related to the restructure of our organization and other unusual expenses. These charges were offset by a nonrecurring benefit of about $6.5 million related to lower stock comp expense as a result of the restructure. As a result of these transformation expenses, our tax rate increased about 400 basis points, which I'll explain later. \nThe Q2 comp of 3.3% was primarily driven by higher average checks due to the price increases taken over the last year as well as queso add-ons. Price increase averaged about 4% in the quarter, and customer resistance to the price increase remains at or below 20%. \nThe menu price impact was lower than Q1 as we lapped the first increase from April of last year in about 20% of our restaurants. Sales trends in the first 3 weeks of July continue to mirror what we saw in Q2, with the comp increasing over the last week or so as we've begun to compare against those softer trends from last year. \nSo overall, comps should improve from the 3.3% in Q2. However, keep in mind that comparisons will get tougher later in Q3 as we lap the introduction of queso in early September, which initially added about 3.5% to the comp before settling into a sustained benefit to the average check of about 2%. And in November, we will lap the price increase in about 1,000 restaurants, which added an additional 1.3% prorated impact to the comp. \nBased on second quarter results and expected improvement in the Q3 comp, we're increasing our full year comp sales guidance from low single digits to a low to mid-single-digit comp range. \nWe opened 34 new restaurants in the quarter and expect to be at the lower end of our 130 to 150 new opening guidance for the full year. While we're still building inventory for next year's openings, we continue to expect 2019 openings will be at or above the 2018 levels. \nOur new restaurants this year have opened strong, and we're continuing to emphasize high-quality, high-returning new restaurants as we build out our pipeline. \nAs mentioned on our last call, we expect to close between 55 and 65 underperforming restaurants. And today, we're closing 29 Chipotle restaurants. \nDuring the second quarter, we closed 5 Pizzeria Locales in Kansas and Ohio, and we also closed 3 Chipotle restaurants, including one relocation. So with today's closures about half of the underperforming restaurants have now closed. \nFood cost for the quarter were 32.6%, a decrease of 150 basis points from the 34.1% in Q2 of last year. The decrease from last year was driven by the menu price increase and more favorable avocado prices. The decreases were slightly offset by elevated prices for our steak and barbacoa. We expect food cost increase to the low 33% range in Q3 due to the seasonal shift to source higher cost avocados from California and an uptick in paper and packaging costs. We expect to be closer to the 33% in Q4 as we begin to shift the supply of avocados back to Mexico. \nLabor costs for the quarter were 27%, an increase of 80 basis points from the 26.2% in Q2 of last year. The increase from last year was driven primarily from wage inflation of about 6% and increased restaurant manager bonus costs as we returned to normalized bonus payouts, rewarding our managers for delivering strong results. \nThese increases were offset by leverage from the menu price increase. We expect labor costs to increase to the high 27% range in Q3 and to the mid-28% range in Q4, and these increases are driven primarily by seasonally lower sales in Q3 and Q4 and by general wage pressures. \nOccupancy costs for the quarter were 6.9%, which is flat with last year. Other operating costs for the quarter were 13.8%, a decrease of 20 basis points from Q2 of last year. \nOur marketing and promo costs were 3.2% in the quarter, a decrease of about 40 basis points compared to Q2 of last year. We expect marketing and promo costs to be at or slightly above 3% of sales for the full year, with elevated spending continuing in Q3 and Q4. \nOther operating costs continue to include about 30 basis points of higher maintenance and repair costs, which we first discussed on our Q4 call, and we expect M&R to continue at this elevated level for the rest of the year. \nG&A in the quarter increased by $8 million compared to Q1 of this year. The increase compared to last quarter was primarily due to the stock comp forfeitures and the timing of the 2018 equity grant that we discussed on the last earnings call. \nAnd as I mentioned earlier, G&A also included $7 million in charges related to the restructuring and additional unusual charges in the quarter, but those were offset by a $6.5 million nonrecurring benefit related to revising our estimates of forfeitures related to stock grants for employees expected to leave the company. \nThe G&A increase compared to Q2 of last year was primarily in support of our restaurant growth, digitizing our restaurant experience and operational leadership changes in the field. \nDepreciation expense for the quarter was 3.9%, an increase of 40 basis points from the 3.5% in Q2 of last year. This increase is due to the accelerated depreciation for items we're replacing related to the maintenance and repair refresh as well as capital initiatives that we described on our Q4 call. We expect the increase related to the refresh to fall off in the second half of the year. \nHowever, it will be replaced by accelerated depreciation from the restaurant closures we detailed earlier. As a result, we expect depreciation to remain at this elevated level for the rest of this year. \nOur pretax income was $70 million and our reported effective tax rate was 33.3%. Our tax rate was higher than the 29% underlying rate we discussed on our last earnings call and is a direct result of the $42 million in unusual expenses this quarter. \nWithout these charges, our tax rate would have been right around a 28.5% effective rate, and we expect to return to a roughly 29% rate next year when the transformation charges are fully behind us. This underlying rate of about 29% may be affected in future years by stock comp vesting and exercises when the benefit realized by our employees varies from our accounting treatment, and we'll fully call out these impacts as they occur. \nWe continue to expect the transformation costs from the restructuring, restaurant closures and other unusual costs will total between $115 million and $135 million, with most of that amount hitting in 2018. We estimate that about $50 million to $55 million will hit in Q3, with most of the remainder in Q4. There will likely be some charges related to terminating restaurant and office leases that will spill into 2019. \nWe'll also write off about $10 million in deferred tax assets beginning in Q4, with most hitting in 2019 as fully vested but underwater options will likely expire as we complete the restructure of the organization. \nIn Q3, we expect our effective tax rate to be right around 30.3% or about 130 basis points higher than we guided last quarter. In Q4, we expect our tax rate to be as high as 43% or about 450 basis points higher than we guided last quarter. Both of these increases are due to a lower pretax income as a result of the transformation expenses. \nAs mentioned during our Q1 call, our Q4 rate is impacted by performance shares that will likely expire in that period because the performance shares will only vest if the stock price is over $700. We took deductions on these performance shares over the years but if they prove worthless, we won't get a tax benefit contributing to the estimated 43% tax rate. \nWe'll continue to provide more specifics on future transformation-related costs when we have more certainty around the timing, and we will continue to break out the unusual costs from normal costs so you can follow the underlying trends. \nWe're encouraged by our second quarter results and the contributions of our restaurant teams to deliver an excellent guest experience. We're also encouraged by our guest response to our digital initiative so far, along with a solid sales and restaurant-level margin performance during the quarter. We're confident that significant changes we're making to our organization will enable us to continue to improve operational excellence in our restaurants, to be more nimble and innovative in digital, access, menu and the restaurant environment, and to execute better to deliver on our commitments to our guests, our employees and our shareholders. And now, we're happy to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Sara Senatore with Bernstein.\nAnalysts: Just on the 2Q, the implication is with 4 points of price, I think that you saw some negative traffic. And I guess, how do you turn that around? And in particular, you talked about really a lot of growth in digital usage. But do you think you're substituting -- just substituting from walk-in orders or can you actually tell that these orders are incremental? And are you starting to build a database of your customers that might allow for better targeted marketing?\nExecutives: Yes. Thanks for the question. Obviously, I think I may have mentioned in my early remarks, a lot of our new transaction-driving initiatives are getting ready to head to pilot, and we also are working on some new marketing communication as well. So I think as those things start to enter markets and then we gain learnings on how to improve those programs and then plan for national execution, the goal is to use the staged-gate process then to inform what our sales and transaction performance can be going forward. The good news is our price increase that we passed through has passed through nicely. We're not seeing customer counts retreat versus anything we've seen historically when we take pricing. I mean, regarding your question on digital sales, obviously, there's multiple elements to that, right? There's the delivery aspect, there's our catering, and then there's also the app or website orders. And we see varying degrees of incrementality across each of those spaces. The thing that we do know, though, is when we get a digital order through that second make-line, the economics of that order are very attractive, and then our customer satisfaction scores also are very attractive. So we've continued to see improvements on accuracy and speed at which we're getting people the food they want, when they want, where they want it. So still a lot to learn. And actually, when we get the pilot going on our loyalty program, I think that's going to give us another level of insight and understanding on exactly how all these transactions are interacting with each other. And that's a new skill we're going to be building for the organization going forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Tarantino.\nAnalysts: Just maybe a clarification question on the comps for the quarter. Could you maybe explain how the trend transpired as the quarter progressed? It sounded as if, on the last call, you might have started a little slow and then maybe picked up later in the quarter. But is that accurate? Or how should we think about that?\nExecutives: Yes, David. I think that is accurate. We talked on the last call that in April, because of weather and the seasonal shift of Easter, that we got off to a slow start. May was a great month for us, that's when we had the DoorDash promotion, so May looked great. And then June settled in right at about the overall average for the month. So I would say, the overall comp of 3.3% is a good kind of gauge for what the underlying trend was. A little less in April, more in May but then we settled out right in the middle in June. And so, we feel good about the way that we ended the quarter and how we're entering the third quarter now.\nAnalysts: Great. That's helpful. And then, I guess, Jack or Brian, that does suggest a little bit of underlying improvement in at least the way we look at the business on a sequential basis on traffic. So could you maybe talk about what you think drove that improvement, whether it was the operations improvements you talked about? And then on the operations improvements in particular, is there any sort of deeper look at that data that would suggest that's moving the needle as you kind of split the restaurants that are doing the best from the worst apart from one another?\nExecutives: Yes. Look, I don't think it was just one thing. The good news is though, as I've mentioned earlier, we've seen improvement in our operations on all the key metrics. And we continue to hear more and more positive customer feedback on their experiences and fewer -- or a reduction in customer complaints. And we believe there's even more opportunity for us to get even better on throughput going forward. So we're pleased with the progress we're making on ops. We also saw in the quarter, people really responded positively to the advertising that we put out there. And then obviously, we've seen very positive responses to varying elements of our digital program. So I think it was a combination of multiple things, not one thing that drove it. And that's what has us excited about how we're moving forward with all the pilots across the business. We're making progress, I think, on ops, we're making progress on digital, and we're making progress on really understanding our customer base better. So that, you know what, we get the brands the right message, then with the right food at the right place with the right value, I think we'll continue to see improvement in our performance.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nicole Miller with Piper Jaffray.\nAnalysts: Culture of accountability. Could you talk a little bit more about maybe how it's changed to work in the store day-to-day? And how are you aligning that with incentives to have the employees make these changes?\nExecutives: Nicole, I think we missed the first part of your question. Could you just start from the beginning?\nAnalysts: Absolutely. So asking about the culture of accountability, and I thought it was helpful how you talked about how that translated to the customer engagement or improved guest satisfaction. So what I'm wondering is from the employee perspective, in that store, how is it different to work there today than before? And what are the incentives that you have put in place to keep them aligned with your culture of accountability?\nExecutives: Yes. Thanks for the question. Obviously, one of the things that I think Scott's done a nice job in the field is the accountability is both on developing a great team as well as being accountable to providing a great experience for the customer. So I think we're starting to see our teams being more staffed correctly, engaged at another level than where they had been over the last couple years, and everybody has clarity on what their role is on the team. And I think we've talked about this in the past, but we've given everybody their kind of top 5 responsibilities, which then gives the team the ability to trust that each other is going to be doing what they need to do for them to be successful. And then to your question on incentives, yes, we've moved to some quarterly bonus programs and we've seen that actually have a material impact on our employee satisfaction with -- when they make great progress then they get rewarded much closer to when they have that success. So I think it's the combination really of making sure that we're holding ourselves accountable to a great experience but also holding ourselves accountable to develop a great team and then obviously rewarding them when they have successes.\nAnalysts: And then just a final question. When you think about the structural framework previously of a $2 million AUV translating loosely to a 20% store-level margin, you're doing that yet you have over 3 percentage points of marketing that is at least twice as much as what it had been historically. So it seems that there might be more leverage in the model. Is there any kind of framework you could give or update for us to think about as we model going forward?\nExecutives: Nicole, we've also got M&R just a little high as well. So I mean, the results we're seeing in the last couple of quarters give us even more confidence that the model, at $2 million, gets you right about in that high teens to 20% margin. And as we grow the volume from there, we think we can move back up into the 20-plus percent margin. So the things that we thought the model can do, I think we're starting to see that they're coming to [ life ].\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets.\nAnalysts: Brian, you mentioned some statistics earlier about how the fast-casual occasion, perhaps, overlaps with that of fast food in some ways with younger generations and that trial seems to be important with these consumers. I'm trying to understand what you're seeing and saying about the opportunity there. In the past, I think Chipotle tried to get trial going, coupons and the like, with this understanding that if you get trial, they'll come back. But how are you thinking about marketing perhaps different than that and using the data you're seeing?\nExecutives: Sure, yes. So I think I mentioned this in our call a couple weeks ago. We've got a big foundational consumer study out, and we're starting to get some top lines in. And what we have definitely seen is when people try the brand and have a positive experience with it, their intent to stay with the brand is much higher than a lot of our competitors in both fast-casual as well as fast food. And it's very exciting because when we look at younger people, we get an even more positive response to intent and then intent to stay with us. So that's what I was referencing. And then the brand, obviously, I think we all instinctually see this as very much a purpose-driven brand that syncs up nicely with Gen Z and millennials, and we're seeing that play out in our research as well. So we're going to want to continue to build on that strength as we move forward.\nAnalysts: And Jack, you mentioned the restructuring expense that you expect. I know it's not typical, necessarily, in the sector, but could you talk about the dollar savings you anticipate or maybe the return on investment from these store closures and restructuring expenses and the timing of that? Any color would be helpful.\nExecutives: Yes, David. On the restaurants we're closing, these are all cash flow-losing restaurants. We've got about half of them closed right now. So it's going to take -- before we can see the full effect, we're going to have to have them all closed. But we should pick up somewhere in the 20, 30 basis points of margin once they're all closed. So there's a definite improvement in our margin returns from that standpoint. Most of the other costs, that's more with restructuring the organization. There's going to be return on that. It's not going to be as black and white or linear. The return is going to be on having a culture that's more innovative, a culture that's more results-oriented. And we think there's going to be lots and lots of benefits there, but it's going to be less of a cause and effect where we can tell you what the actual return is.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Karen Holthouse with Goldman Sachs.\nAnalysts: This is actually Jared on for Karen. Can you guys give us a sense of maybe delivery as a percent of your total sales at this point, and maybe just some context about how delivery is contributing to a stronger comp in 2Q versus 3Q?\nExecutives: Yes, delivery is a piece of that 10% number that I mentioned earlier on our digital sales. And what we're seeing is, today, we're in 1,700 restaurants, we'll be expanding to closer to 2,000 here shortly. Really, the delivery performance, not surprising, right now, what we're seeing is it really is impacted by how we promote it, because we're in the early days of getting people to even understand that it's available. I think, the last number I saw, we still have over 50% of customers not realizing Chipotle is available for delivery. So we're seeing some variability in the delivery performance based on how we promote with these partners. The thing that is exciting though is we are seeing, when we get that bump, we don't fall below where we were. So we're continuing to see progress. And I think, over time, as we build awareness, build a habit, I think we'll see this play a bigger and bigger role in getting us into an off-premise occasion.\nAnalysts: And if I could just follow up with one more. Have you guys seen any learnings early on the new menu test items that you have in tests right now?\nExecutives: Sure. I think I mentioned this earlier. We're actually -- you've seen the products in our NEXT Kitchen where that's really just for us to look at operational execution. And we're just getting ready to use our staged-gate process to move a handful of initiatives into an actual test market, where we'll be at scale, where we'll start to really have true learnings of customer experience, team member experience and then how that plays out on total Chipotle performance. So too early to comment on any of those items right now.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andy Barish with Jefferies.\nAnalysts: Two things just on -- can you help us understand as you start to lap, I think you mentioned, Jack, the July issues last year in Virginia, just how we should think about that maybe 500 or 600 basis points decline in traffic kind of coming back?\nExecutives: Yes, Andy. There's a couple things going on right now. We're also comparing against, right now, SAVOR.WAVS. So we did see a nice uptick in a comp in the last week or so as we compare it to the soft sales from last year. But SAVOR.WAVS happened as well, which there was a big BOGO, a lot of buy one, get one. And so, that's creating a little bit of noise, but we do expect to see much more attractive traffic and much more attractive sales comps over the next several weeks. And that'll only be slowed a bit as we compare to the launch of queso last year, which I talked about in my prepared comments. So yes, we're already seeing the positive effect from the comparisons to last year -- to the softness from last year.\nAnalysts: Got you. And then anything on sort of pricing as you do the research on the brand, the ability to be a more regular menu price increase taker instead of every several years as has been the case in the past?\nExecutives: Yes. So one of the things we're definitely looking to understand is exactly the health over value equation. The good news is, our value continues to be very strong. And what we're assessing right now is what is the right approach to sequencing pricing over time, making sure we don't ever get ahead of a great value equation? So that's part of the consumer research, frankly, that we've got going on right now. As we get those learnings back, it we will inform how we approach pricing going forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays.\nAnalysts: This is actually Jeff Priester on for Jeff Bernstein. Operationally, given all these initiatives, including your potential new items coming from the NEXT Kitchen, and I know, in New York, some of the pickup shelves around the end of your actual make-line, is there going to be an issue down the line where implementing some of these initiatives where you need to expand the line or reorganize it to get some of these things out there? And then I have one follow-up.\nExecutives: Yes, sure. So I think I've mentioned this before. Obviously, everything we're looking at has to be thoughtfully executed so that the throughput engine of Chipotle is not jeopardized. And I think I mentioned this earlier, there's some projects that frankly, just are a bolt-on. So like a digital-shelf pickup, that actually improves the customer experience and the team member experience because it illuminates that confusion for where the mobile order person is supposed to go, that awkward moment at the cashier, it eliminates a lot of that. So that, in our opinion, is a throughput enabler because 2 things happen. One, it merchandises the fact that you can do this mobile ordering and not have to go through the line. And then the second piece is it really takes advantage of our second make-line, which is, I think, a huge advantage to open up an off-premise business. But look, the varying initiatives, if it comes with needs for new equipment, we'll test out the new equipment and make sure that it works and plays nicely with the throughput engine that we have. If it doesn't, then that's why we use the staged-gate process to learn and figure out how we try again. And it's going to be an [ intricate ] process with us, so I'm very excited that we're going to start the process of seeing some of these pilots get into market, so that we protect the integrity of what's made Chipotle great, while we figure out how we enhance relevance and dial up engagement.\nAnalysts: Great. And then on delivery, can you give us a sense of the average check you're seeing relative to your dining customer and then, as well as the number of customers per order, the number of entrées per order, however you want to approach it?\nExecutives: Yes, I mean, we see obviously, a nice increase in our digital orders. So the mobile and delivery orders are in that $16 to $17 range versus our traditional check is in the $12 range. And we're still learning, frankly, what is the order size that comes with it versus additional attachments like chips and guac and queso and so on and so forth. But we're really seeing a blend, right now, of both there are times we see more add-ons and then there are times where clearly it's a larger group occasion that's off-premise that's ordering through the app or through the delivery third party.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.\nAnalysts: This Brandon on for John. I believe on the first quarter call, you mentioned that you expected marketing and promo to be elevated throughout the remainder of the year. Do you still expect that to play out throughout the back half of '18 here?\nExecutives: Yes, we were -- it will be a little elevated. We were light in the first quarter, we were at 3.2% this past quarter, and we'll be right at about that same 3.2%. So overall for the year, we'll average right at about 3% for the overall year.\nAnalysts: Got it, okay. And then I just had a follow up. You mentioned in your prepared remarks, the restaurant AB and guest sat scores are beginning to trend in the right direction. Could you elaborate on that comment and maybe quantify some of those improvements?\nExecutives: Yes. So the restaurant AB is the measurement tool that we use that's a couple of metrics that are very important to us that cover financials, people, guest experience and the team, okay? And what we're happy to see is we're seeing a nice move from Bs to As, and that's a good sign. So it's a very important metric, it's one that Scott keeps a laser eye on, and it's a good way for us to understand how we're performing in our restaurants and how we're actually making progress.\nOperator: Our final question comes from the line of Jake Bartlett with SunTrust.\nAnalysts: Great. First, I just wanted to get a sense for how much of the initiatives are driving or how much the improved outlook in the back is driven by the initiatives or driven by the easy to compares? And I know in terms of the initiatives, there's a lot of unknown timing. But maybe you can talk about what you do know. For instance, I believe when you get your study back on the consumer, that's going to be the source of a new advertising campaign, maybe some impact of the change in the new catering menu. I'm thinking about the shelf rollout. You just mentioned how kind of a no-brainer it is. I mean, is that really a test that's going on or is that just kind of a -- I mean, should we expect that to be rolled out here in the back half?\nExecutives: You know what, I didn't hear the last part of your question, but let me answer the first part, which is, as we've talked about our guidance, it's got very -- it's got nearly 0 on the initiatives that we've been talking about that we are putting into pilot and that we're going to start expanding over the course of the year. So what we're seeing right now, I think is what I mentioned earlier, which is I think we're seeing a nice improvement in our operational performance. I think we've got more visible, more effective, more relevant marketing out there, and I think we've done a nice job of expanding access through our digital efforts. I think it's going to continue to be the combination of all those things plus, as we get some learning on loyalty and potentially some new menus items down the road, that we'll see initiatives play then, hopefully, a bigger role going forward. But as of right now, there's -- I think it's very minimal. And what was the second part of your question?\nAnalysts: The second part was just your initiatives like the digital -- like, the shelves, the pickup shelves. You mentioned a kind of it's a no-brainer operationally. I mean, what is the [ optional ] to just kind of rolling that out and not considering it a test but kind of just seeing a roll out. What is there to test with that?\nExecutives: Yes. So look, I think, as an organization, we're going to be a test-and-learn organization before we go launch. And even though going into, where we've put it in these 5 stores, our early indications were it's a no-brainer. The good news is in the first 5 stores, it went as we had hoped. And as a result, we're expanding now to 4 or 5 markets in very short order. And then the goal is, assuming we continue to see the positive performance, we'll get it across the system in very short order thereafter.\nAnalysts: Great. And Jack, a clarification on the tax guidance. I'm just looking, if I think about adjusted earnings comparable to the $2.87 that you mentioned today, I look at the adjusted tax rate there, and it's 28.5% is my estimate. So when you think about the third quarter effective tax rate that you've mentioned in the fourth quarter, is that more relevant to GAAP earnings? Or is that relevant to the adjusted earnings we might be focused on?\nExecutives: Those rates are more GAAP earnings. The underlying rates are going to be more similar to what we talked about on our last call. So the higher tax rates that you're seeing this time compared to what we talked about on our first quarter call are directly attributable to the fact that we've got all these charges. It's just pushing our income down, and so it ends up pushing our rates up. When we normalize our earnings, like for example in this quarter, our normal tax rate would be in that 28.5% range.\nAnalysts: Got it. And then last question, just because I think there is some confusion around depreciation as I look at different estimates, a fairly wide range. Could you help us understand what is accelerated depreciation in 2018 and will not kind of recur in '19? And maybe whether you think that depreciation as a whole would be potentially less in '19 than the '18 overall.\nExecutives: Yes, '19 will definitely be less. We're at a higher level this year, call it 30 basis points or so. That's due to 2 things. One is due to retiring assets as a result of our refresh. We're investing in operating our restaurants, so that requires accelerated depreciation on the items that are going to be taken out of the restaurant. And then secondly, part of the restaurants that haven't closed yet, we leave a little bit on the books. GAAP requires that you leave a little bit of the asset on the books and then you write that off over the remaining time that you expect that restaurant to be open. And so as the M&R that we're doing, the refresh that we're doing, as that depreciation levels off, that'll be replaced by this higher depreciation from the stores that we're going to close, but that should fall off. Most of it should fall off this year, maybe into early next year, and then our depreciation should go to more the normal historical rates.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of our question-and-answer session, and I would like to turn the call back over to Chipotle CEO, Brian Niccol, for closing remarks.\nExecutives: Okay. Well, thank you, everybody. I know this is a busy earnings time, so I appreciate everybody taking the time to listen to our results and have a discussion of the business. And thanks again, and I'm sure we'll be in touch. Take care.\nOperator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."

         "Operator: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Chipotle Q3 2018 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Coralie Witter. Please go ahead.\nExecutives: Hi, everyone, and welcome to our call today. By now, you should have access to our earnings announcement released this afternoon for the third quarter of 2018. It may also be found on our Investor Relations website at ir.chipotle.com.

The quiet period will begin on the 16th day of the last month of each fiscal quarter and continues until the next earnings conference call. For the fourth quarter of 2018, it will begin December 16 and continue through our fourth quarter earnings release. We will start today's call with some prepared remarks from Brian Niccol, Chief Executive Officer; and Jack Hartung, Chief Financial Officer. After which, we will take questions. Our entire executive leadership team is available during the Q&A period. And now, I will turn the call over to Brian Niccol.\nExecutives: Thanks, Coralie, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report our third quarter results, which demonstrated that our strategy today and cultivate a better future at work. Total overall sales grew 8.6% to $1.2 billion, driven by comparable restaurant sales increases of 4.4% and 28 new restaurants opened in the quarter. The positive comp sales trends enabled us to expand restaurant level margin, which were up 260 basis points year-over-year to 18.7%. \nEarnings per share adjusted for unusual costs were 62% to $2.16, and our GAAP earnings were $1.36. While the court experienced some sales headwinds, we had a noticeable lift in sales for the launch of our new four-wheel marketing campaign in late September, and that increase has sustained through October. Marketing that drives culture, drives difference and drives purchase, combined with great operations, drives results. \nAdditionally in Q3, key growth initiatives moved forward at a healthy pace, and the team executed with the excellence to relocation, the restructuring, the hiring of new talent and our all manager conference. We exit the quarter with momentum, which sets us up for a solid fourth quarter, and we remain focused on building a culture of innovation and great execution that will drive sustainable long-term growth. \nBefore I dive deeper into this quarter's great spots, I'd like to take a step back to remind you that our strategy to win today and cultivate the future is based on 5 focus area: one, becoming a more culturally relevant and engaging brand that builds love and loyalty; two, digitizing and modernizing our restaurant experience to create a more convenient and enjoyable guest experience; three,  turning great restaurants with great hospitality and throughput; four, being disciplined and focused to enhance our powerful economic model; and five, building a great culture that can innovate and execute across digital, access menu and restaurant experience. \nThis quarter, we've made strides towards becoming a more culturally-relevant and engaging brand. Our four-wheel campaigns celebrates what is uniquely chipotle, that our food reflects our belief that there's a connection between health food as raised prepared in how it tastes. Real flavors, real ingredients and real cooking techniques result in food that simply taste better. \nWe are making much better use of our advertising budget by more effectively communicating who we are and by being in better communication channel, thereby increasing our resident and visibility. We'll continue to be present on national TV for the middle of November, and the four-wheel messaging will remain visible in digital and social channels for the balance of the year. Going forward, you can expect Chipotle to have a presence and national media, where and when it makes sense, and to have on always on the social digital program. \nWhile we are a brand that speaks everyone, our consumer research tells us that we are particularly relevant to millennials and Gen Z consumers, who share our values, and our customers also want to be our employee. During September, we hosted our own managers conference, and it was clear from looking at our general managers and field leaders in the audience that they reflect our customer base. Our team's came away from this conference energized around our purpose, our values and our goals and ready to get back to the restaurants armed with inspiration and information on how to improve the hiring experience, the training experience and the guest experience. \nIn Q3, we made progress on our purpose of cultivating a better world with the announcement of an accelerated program called the Chipotle Illuminaries Project. This is funded by our Chipotle Cultivate Foundation to help food-focused growth stage ventures that share our belief of cultivating a better world and are seeking to disrupt the current food landscape and take their business the next level. \nWe are using insights from our consumer research to refine our innovation pipeline and how we communicate with our guest. We continue to hear that the #1 reason that consumers eat elsewhere is because they don't have convenient access to Chipotle. Expanding the reach of our digital system remains a key priority in providing our guests with easier access and greater convenience. The digitized second make-lines are now nearly 750 restaurants and continue to be on track to be an all restaurants by the end of next year. The digital pickup shelves are now in nearly 350 restaurants, and we are moving quickly to get them in all our restaurants before the middle of 2019. \nWe continued to build momentum in digital this quarter, with digital sales going 48%, accelerating from the year-over-year growth rate to we saw in the first half of this year and now accounting for 11.2% of sales. App downloads have increased 25% since last quarter, and we are seeing strong interest from a new and infrequent customers as well as frequent customers. \nAs was the case last quarter, we are seeing particularly strong momentum from delivery. In Q2, we added DoorDash's new partner and in Q3, we added delivery capabilities directly from our app and website. A free delivery promotion from our app in September drove an acceleration in delivery sales in the quarter. We continuously incrementality delivery, and we see very little customer overlap between our own in-app delivery and our third-party delivery partner app. We are pleased with how delivery in our app is attracting and retaining new and lapsed customers, and the results we're seeing across our delivery channels validate our strategy to be available wherever and however our guests want to access us. \nAs we continue to remove the friction from the digital ordering and pick-up process, we would expect our delivery time advantage to continue to widen. Our current average delivery time is under 30 minutes, already making us one of the most attractive choices for customers on our delivery partner's website, and this will keep getting better. As part of our goal to increase access, we are also exploring new format that leverage digitally-enabled convenience. We're pleased with the early results from our initial digital pickup lane restaurants, and we will expand this test to additional new restaurants in 2019 across several market. These restaurants have a convenient drive up window for guest to pick of digital orders, a clear from these that are guest appreciate the added convenience as these restaurants generate digital sales that are far above our national average. This format is also a win for operations as the window leverages are digital make-line. \nWe're also is it about our loyalty test, which was launched in September in pretest market. It's very early, but sign-ups look promising. And we'll evaluate from loyalty test as it moves to the stage in preparation for national launch during 2019. \nWe also have a number of menu items going through our new CHP process, so that you can build the pipeline for future years. We're testing quesadillas, nachos, bacon, lemonade and the Mexican chocolate milkshake, for example. These items are in different phases of the stage process. Importantly, we are improving our ability to deliver great innovations for our customers and restaurant teams with the new continuing operations screening process, more consumer insight and a better cross-functional process from idea at the launch. \nLastly, I'd like to touch on where we are in organizational transformation. That our all managers conference last month, we rolled out our new values. These are: one, the line is the moment of truth; two, teach and taste Chipotle; three, authenticity lives here; and four, the movement is real. These values were very well received to the conference by restaurant managers who are more energized than ever. We also emphasize the following key areas for operations to focus on going forward: #1, throughput excellence; #2, team stability and development; #3, great-tasting food; and #4, great customer hospitality. We did a number of store visits following the conference restaurants managers where they took away. I'm happy to say we are aligned from the support center to each individual restaurant. \nThese values and focus areas also form the foundations for the culture we are building in our support centers, which exist to serve our general managers and team members so that they can delight our guests. I'm pleased with the significant progress we've made in rebuilding Chipotle into the organization with an inclusive culture that sets us up to be more innovative, more connected to what our guests want and better at executing so that we can capitalize on the tremendous growth opportunities in front of us. \nI'm delighted with the great talent that we are attracting as well as the talent that we're relocating. We've continued to enhance our leadership team, adding Roger , as General Counsel who joins us from Whiteley. The restructuring and relocations are nearing completion, and we are building an organization with best-in-class and diverse talent. I love the start of energy. It greets me everyday I come in. \nFinally, before I turn it over to Jack, I want to thank of our team members across the company that are providing our guests with a great experience, serving real food cooked-to-perfection and prepared in our restaurants with fresh ingredients. \nI'd also like to thank our general managers who collect the leader the managing restaurant channel during quarter 3, enabling Chipotle to deliver on financial commitment. Okay. Over to you, Jack.\nExecutives: Thanks, Brian. I'm equally pleased with how our team's growth didn't miss a beat despite managing a significant restructuring that delivers solid quarter and great sales momentum that is carried into the fourth quarter. We generated revenue of $1.2 billion during the quarter, an increase of 8.6% from last year on comp sales growth of 4.4%. \nRestaurant level margins of 18.7% expanded 260 basis points from last year, contributing to underlying earnings per share adjusted for unusual items up 62% to $2.16. \nThe third quarter had unusual expenses, mostly related to the transformation and that negatively impacted our tax rate and our earnings per share by about $0.80, leading to GAAP earnings per share of $1.36. \nAs discussed last quarter, we'll continue to see costs over the next few quarters associated with our restructuring, relocation and underperforming store closures. \nIn Q3, we recognize $26 million in total targets with $10 million related to underperforming or closed restaurant and $16 million related to the organizational restructuring and other unusual expenses. As result of the transformation as well as noncash tax item, our reported effective tax rate increased to 36.8% or about 690 basis points higher than underlying effective tax rate of 29.9% that I'll explain later. \nIn Q3 comp of 4.4% was primarily driven by higher average jacked up of pricing increase taken last November and January, and to a lesser extent, the addition of case menu. During the quarter comps were in the mid-single digits during July and August before softening to low single digit in September when we compared to the advertised launch of queso in 2017. The launch of our four-wheel campaign with national TV in late September, comps moved back up and our running 4% so far in October. \nLooking to Q4, we'll lap the price increase in about 1,000 restaurants in November, which will be headwind to our overall Q4 comp by about 100 basis points. \nWe would typically provide our first glance of our comp guidance for 2019 right now, but with a growing pipeline of initiatives still early on in the process, we'll hold off and providing 2019 comp guidance until we have a better perspective of the timing and expected impact of each of these initiatives. \nWe opened 28 new restaurant in the quarter and continue to expect to be at the lower end of our 130 to 150 new openings guidance for the full year. Our new restaurant this year have opened strong levels, and we continue to emphasize high-quality, high returning new restaurants as we build out the pipeline. As a result of these strong new economics combined with a healthy pipeline for next year's opening, we expect to open between 140 to 155 new restaurants in 2019. \nAs mentioned on our last call, we expect to close between 55 and 65 underperforming restaurants. In the quarter, we closed to 32 of these restaurants and 38 in total, including the 6 closed in Q2, all related to the restructuring. The remaining underperforming restaurants were closed over the next several quarters as we pursue strategic alternatives to manage our future rent liability. \nFood cost for the quarter were 33.4%, a decrease of 160 basis points from the 35% in Q3 of last year. The decrease from last year was driven by the menu price increase as well as more favorable avocado prices. These were offset by elevated prices for beef and paper and packaging items. We expect to be in the low 33% range in Q4 with the slight decrease from Q3 due to the shift in the avocado back to Mexico, provincially. Labor cost for the quarter were 27.2% or flat compared to Q3 of last year. The price increase offset wage inflation of about 4% to 5%. We also decreased our workers' comp liability by about $4 million in the quarter due to better management of claims activity so far this year. We expect labor cost to increase in the mid-28% range in Q4 as a result of deleverage from seasonally lower sales as well as continued wage pressure. \nOccupancy cost for the quarter was 7.1%, a decrease of 30 basis points compared to Q3 last year, and that's due mostly to the increase in comp sales. \nOther operating cost for the quarter were 13.7%, a decrease of 70 basis points from Q3 of last year. Our marketing promo costs were 2.5% in the quarter, a decrease of about 70 basis points compared to Q3 of last year. The lower-than-expected marketing in Q3 is due to the timing and shift into Q4 as our four-wheel campaign began in late September and will continue through mid-November. \nAs a result, we expect marketing and promo cost will be in the low 4% of sales during Q4, while full year marketing promo will still be right around 3% of sales overall for the year. \nOther operating costs continue to include about 30 basis points of higher maintenance and repair costs, which we first discussed on the Q4 2017 call, and we expect M&R to continue at this elevated level for the rest of the year before abating in 2019. \nG&A in the quarter increased $24 million compared to Q2 of this year. The increase compared to last quarter was primarily due to $16 million in charges related to the restructuring and other unusual charges in the quarter as well as $11 million for bi-annual all manager conference. \nCompared to Q3 of last year, the items I just listed mostly offset the one-time charge we had in same quarter of last year. Underlying G&A increase compared to last year, primarily in support of our restaurant growth and digitizing our restaurant experience and operational leadership changes in the field. The Q4 we expect total DNA fee right around $95 million, which includes an estimated $10 million to $12 million of restructuring-related expenses. \nUnderlying G&A in Q4, excluding bonuses and stock comp is expected to be at similar levels as Q2 and Q3 of this year, however, both bonuses and stock comp are expected to be higher year-over-year as a result of better performance. \nDepreciation for the quarter was 4.3%, an increase of 60 basis points from the 3.7% in Q3 of last year. This increase is due to the accelerated depreciation for the restaurant closures we discussed earlier, and to a lesser extent, accelerated depreciation from the office closure. We now expect transformation costs from restructuring of our restaurant closes and certain other charges to total between $100 million and $120 million versus our initial estimate of $115 million to $135 million, again with most getting in 2018. So far this year, we charge nearly $70 million, and we estimate that another $10 million to $25 million will hit in Q4. And the remaining charges, mostly related to terminating restaurant and office leases will still into 2019. We'll continue to provide specific and future transformation-related cost when we have more certainty around timing, and we'll break out the unusual cost to the usual cost following the underlying trend. \nOur pretax income was $58.5 million and reported effective tax rate was 36.8%. Our 36.8% reported effective tax rate was higher than our 29.9% underlying rate due to the transformation cause and noncash dockside related to the write-off and deferred tax assets associated with underwater option, but we anticipate the underlying rate in Q4 to remain in the 28.9% to 29.9% range. We anticipate our effective Q4 tax rate to be in the high 30% range or higher due to the impact of transformation charges as well as anticipated additional noncash tax write-off. \nDuring the quarter, we repurchased $19 million of our stock at an average price of $474 per share, leaving about $100 million in our current buyback operation. Our buyback rate will remain at this lower level as we fund the transformation costs. This decrease in short term -- the decrease in short term, and we expect to return optimistically referred to shares at a higher level once we've completed the restructuring. \nWe're encouraged by our third quarter results as our team's demonstrated that they can stay focused on serving our guests and executing growth drivers, while also being nimble on managing the business. \nMeanwhile, our support Center made important progress in relocating and hiring talent, hosting our all manager conference and rebuilding and organizational structure designed to innovate and deliver on commitments to our guests, our employees and to our shareholders. And now, we're happy to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Dave Tarantino of Baird.\nAnalysts: Just a couple of questions on the comp trends. First, Brian, or Jack, could you maybe talk about your estimate of the impact, if there was any, from the Ohio incident that was pretty well-publicized? And I guess based on how you look at the business, looking at may be your average daily sales trends and seasonality adjusted for that, do you think this most recent uplift from the marketing program has got your back on trend if there was an impact in Q3? And then I have a couple of follow-ups.\nExecutives: David, this is Jack. There's a lot going on in the quarter. We compared in the middle of the quarter to some software results from the last year. We had avocado day that turned a double day once we broke the Internet. We had a back-to-school promotion that we compared to the new queso we had marketing at the end. So teasing out any single impact was very difficult, that's why it walked through and wanted to given that comp trends throughout the quarter. The thing that we know for sure is that marketing did have an impact as we went on air and as customers start to see the commercials. We did see an improvement in our sales, and I think when I look through the net benefit, by the time we left the quarter, I don't think there's any lasting impact of anything that happened in Ohio.\nAnalysts: Great, that's helpful, Jack. And on the quarter-to-date, you mentioned that 4% from the comp. I know you're cycling now the mix benefits you have, but the queso, I guess as traffic now running positive in the quarter-to-date in the advertising?\nExecutives: You know, David, it's right around flattish. When you look at the 4%, we're still carrying a price increase in about a couple of thousand restaurants will lap the next November, and then the final wave in January. So I called the traffic right around flat.\nAnalysts: Great. And then last question for Brian, you talked a lot about the process with some of the menu innovation you're working on. So I guess at a high level, when do you think we'll start seeing some your items added at the menu? And then if you can maybe share your perspective on what you've learned in adding new items to the menu and the operating model?\nExecutives: Sure. So yes, we've got obviously, a couple items in the stage they produce all in various stages actually, both digital initiatives as well as food initiatives. And I think you're going to see both a digital, the total system from loyalty to our mobile app to our digital shelves, all those things are in this markets right now, and we're very optimistic about what we're seeing. And we're continuing to learn, and the plan is they will start to touch in 2019 consumer. Same thing with the food initiative or 2. So we're still early days, David, but we're learning a lot. We're optimistic about what we're seeing, and we're feeling like the stage the process is working, and it's going to set us up to execute with excellence when some of these initiatives come to market in 2019.\nOperator: The next question will come from John Glass of Morgan Stanley.\nAnalysts: Could you -- there were a couple of operational initiatives, Brian. You talked either on or off-line if throughput seemed like an early opportunity for you, and I think you talked about maybe purchasing professionals in that organization. So some of the operational things that you're taking on, where are you on those? And then do have an impact on the past quarter?\nExecutives: So we are early days into both of those. And the good news is, I would say, our operational focus, I feel like we're out of the starting blocks with getting our throughput to a higher level than where we'd been. But really, our focus was, at that all manager conference, to get everybody aligned on values so that we're hiring the right people, so that ultimately, we can then end with a stable team with the right leaders. And then the other key focus for that meeting was to make sure people understood we're getting back to the throughput excellence, great-tasting food, either of those two things, you end up with great customer prehospital the. And what I love is I feel like we're out of blocks with all the things, and we should -- as we go into 2019, we'll continue to make progress as opposed to just getting started with 2019. And the same thing goes for the supply chain leadership. Carlos, actually, myself and Jack, we already started our visit with some of our key partners, and it's been great to understand the relationship that were started in some cases 25 years ago to some that are relatively new. And the good news is, I think this is an integral process where there's opportunities for Chipotle and our suppliers to benefit going forward. So very optimistic on both of those fronts, and I feel like a lot of good work has been put in place so that when you walk into 2019, we'll start to see some real tangible benefit.\nAnalysts: Just one more for me. On the digital sales growth of this quarter, which is impressive, do you -- are you seeing the operational benefits you hoped, particularly some of the member the margin benefit to help utilizing the second make-line? Or is it too early and have to get the total threshold of volume going to that second make-line to really start to see some of the margin leverage benefit that you might expect?\nExecutives: Yes. I think it's a little too early on the margin side of it, but 1 of the things that's been great to see is where we have the digital make-line, where we have our shelves, and you got this the customer app everywhere. We're seeing increases in customer satisfaction, and we're continuing to see a higher ticket, and it's playing across all those digital channels that we expect, the app, the web and delivery.\nOperator: The next will come from Nicole Miller of Piper Jaffray.\nAnalysts: It seems to me you've had or in the midst of the headquarter cultural residing combination with what is store alignment actually very powerful. So I'm curious, what are today's store-level incentive metric? And I've noticed on some of my visit, some customer contacts in the dining room. And I'm wondering is that the particular element that you're focusing on?\nExecutives: Yes, absolutely. We are very much focused on -- we want people to walk away from Chipotle with a guest experience. And I think you heard me mention is when we say the line is the moment of truth, we believe the whole stage is set from the second you see our line, and those are both digital lines as well as our customer-facing line. And I think what Scott and his team have been also focused on is we got to make sure our hospitality matches our client experience. So you'll see some table touches, you'll see what stock cornerstone start to roll out across the system. So I'm delighted to hear that you're seeing that.\nAnalysts: And could you speak more specifically about the set of metrics for the store-level employees?\nExecutives: Sure. We can talk a little bit more about that. Scott, I don't know if you want to chime in here, but this is all based on our restaurant AB scorecard. So...\nExecutives: Nicole, good to hear from you. Scott here. Yes, so our incentives are currently tied to our AB scorecard, which encompasses sales and profits obviously but also incorporates the guest experience, food safety, obviously paramount to our business. As, and so when we landed that up, we understand where we are from a business unit perspective and everyone's driving to reach the A level. And we've had -- we've made great progress this year of getting there. So hopefully that answers your question around incentives specifically.\nAnalysts: That's very helpful. And then just last question. Brian, when you first talked to us a couple of conference calls ago, you talked a lot about enhancing and aiding the Chipotle awareness. And today, I heard you talk about customers wanting accessibility. So could you compare and contrast those opportunities? And how are you approaching and prioritizing the strategies and tactics between those 2 opportunities?\nExecutives: Yes. I think that you picked up what I think are the 2 biggest levers outside of our operational excellence, around throughput and great hospitality. I think what you just saw with the four-wheel marketing campaign, and this is what I meant by being more visible and also being more focused on what makes Chipotle uniquely different. So you're going to continue to see us push very hard on getting across what makes Chipotle different, what makes Chipotle driving culture through culture and then obviously, we want our marketing to be driving the purchase as well. And I think that can be done at the brand level, which is very exciting for Chipotle because I think our purpose is powerful. The other big lever for us is access, and I think it's going to be driven by this digital access. So those are two things that we are very focused on getting front and center. And then, obviously, I think there are opportunities for many variety and the other things that I talked about. But the 2 biggest focus areas here in the near term are the visibility of the Chipotle brand and purpose because I think we're creating a new category with folks and changing food culture, and we are much more visible with the customer's response, and then the digital access -- aspect is another place where we're seeing great response across that whole digital system that we're rolling out.\nAnalysts: So is it fair may be for us to think about your integrated generating the call to action and the access distribution returned reducing the friction to get to you, is that right?\nExecutives: Well said. I should have started there.\nOperator: The next question will come from Sara Senatore of Sandfort.\nAnalysts: I have 2 follow-ups. One is just in traffic. I think in the past, we've heard there's been a bit of struggle in frequency in the sense of all tiers of customer maybe coming a little bit less. And I was wondering if you could talk about what you're seeing there. Is this where loyalty comes in? Or is it the new menu items that bring people back more frequently? So besides access, what are customers telling you that they want to see most in order to sort of ramp-up that frequency curve, which used to be such a tailwind to Chipotle comp? And then I have another 1.\nExecutives: Sure. So yes. So we've seen, and this is early days, is with our loyalty pilot, we're seeing people that have less frequency answering the program, and we don't have enough time to truly understand what ultimately is going to be the impact on our frequency, but we're very excited about the cohort that we are seeing coming to the loyalty program in the early day. So we think that is going to play out where that program will be the vehicle for driving frequency among the cohort. But today, we have the opportunity to increase in frequency. Another thing that's really been exciting is a lot of our digital business is attracting new and lapsed users to our business. So that's been another really exciting learning for us. And then I think your point on what about the people that are historically were coming all the time, I think that's where we need to get back to talking about what makes Chipotle unique in culture, food culture, what makes our purpose so different because that really resonates with our heavy users that are bought in. And we've seen some early indications that, that's a great way to drive frequency into our loyalists.\nAnalysts: That's helpful. And then just on the unit, you are serving at the low end of the range this year but obviously, we'll be above that in fiscal '19 guidance. I'm just trying to understand the extent to which this year's build rate with maybe a function with reestablishing your growth pipeline or your development kind of how your project versus just the how many attractive trade areas are left? Next year, I guess, would we expect to see more of a makeshift towards some of the newer or less established? Or are you going to continue to mostly focus on these established markets?\nExecutives: I'll answer, and then I'll let Jack chime in well. But yes, look, what we're really excited about is the restaurants that we opened this year opened very strong. And the economics or continuing to open Chipotle restaurants above the rate of which we open this year. And I think that was the guidance which I shared with you all. The thing that's also exciting about Chipotle is we're finding we're having success in some new formats. As I've mentioned, in the earlier statements, the digital pickup lane is a very exciting proposition, we're going to do more of those next year. We're also very excited about how we're seeing success in proven markets and the new markets that got the brakes on frankly. But the economic model of new restaurant openings is very powerful and as such, we are building the pipeline and accordingly, so that when the opportunities present themselves, we can take advantage of those. Jack, I don't know if you want to add.\nExecutives: The only thing that I would add -- sorry, we did increase the quality this year and that shows. We've got better economics this year than we have in the past few. We were more discerning, we were more selective. We did focus more of our attention in the proven and fully-developed markets, but we also had great success in some of the new and developing. So I think by being discerning, both in our proven markets and are developing and new markets, we've got better quality. I think that's at the table now for us to take the stair step up that we talked about next year, and I fully expect to continue to build this kind of quality, work for another stairs the year after social. We focus on quality first, and then quantity, second.\nOperator: The next question will come from Andy Barish with Jefferies.\nAnalysts: Just wondering if you could -- I know you've probably given us a bunch of thoughts coming out of your consumer research. But more importantly, on pricing for next year, any initial conclusions on sort of how you're going to approach pricing versus the historical practice of kind of a larger price increase every several years?\nExecutives: I don't know, Jack.\nExecutives: Yes, Andy. We have mentioned on previous calls, we're open to a whole different approach when the early stages of talking as an outside party about our menu compared to competition. Customers that chop within our menu and are there opportunities, and I think you'll more likely see us take smaller price increases rather than wait 2 or 3 years and so then take a larger 1 but nothing report right now.\nAnalysts: Okay and then just a quick follow-up on, again, looking at the next year. Having for real for the full year, how do you anticipate sort of the marketing windows to kind of fall versus obviously, the late roll this year?\nExecutives: Yes. So we are still in the planning phases on exactly when and where we want to use national media. But we feel really good about is, we believe you got the right communication and now, we're working through how we use the right communication vehicles at the right time. But what we do know is we'll have and always on social, mobile, digital effort, and then we're still working through how we use the traditional mediums throughout the year in 2019.\nOperator: The next question comes from Sharon Zackfia from William Blair.\nAnalysts: I guess just a follow-up on an discretion, 3% for marketing, I mean, how are you arriving at that right number? And how do we think about that going into 2019.\nExecutives: Yes. So we believe 3% is the right number based on what our planning process is sharing with us. And we're using our safe process to really understand what those each initiative provide as far as growth goes layered on top of our throughput effort. And what we're seeing is, as of right now, as we reapproach the marketing budget, we're going to change the allocation from a lot of local marketing to a more national. And in that switch, it changes the level of visibility that we can achieve with our marketing dollar. So I think you'll -- what should happen is, our 3% should feel like we're much bigger than what our 3% has been this quarter. And that's our ingoing assumption. Obviously, we find through our stage the process that we have an opportunity to enhance the marketing because the result matches the increased investment, and then we'll do that opportunistically. But the going in plan is to make more out of the 3% than we have in the past.\nAnalysts: Can I ask just a quick follow-up? For 2018, what percent of that marketing budget is digital?\nExecutives: Chris. Do you know that off the top of your head?\nExecutives: It's -- so, I don't know that the answer off the top, and I don't know that we necessarily want to give everybody a clue into that. But clearly, with our consumer base, giving my millennial and more Gen Z, that digital is an integral part of the program for us. And 1 of the things we have a lot of things going on with stage beta in terms of 5 initiatives, but even the media that we are running, we are constantly in a stage of where we look at how we those and how we evaluated and to how it moves the business, and we'll feel free to shift things between more traditional linear media and digital media as the results warrant.\nOperator: The next question will come from David Palmer of RBC Capital Markets.\nAnalysts: A couple of follow-ups for me as well. You talked about operations, digital menu innovation and obviously, you've done a lot of research and testing. But if you were to start of rank your biggest bucket or buckets of opportunity from this point, how would you do that in terms of what is going to be the biggest source of improvement? I think the assumption might be new menu news being the unlock from here, but I want to hear your thoughts.\nExecutives: Yes, look. I don't think new menu news is the primarily unlock. I think it plays a role, but I think the digital access, removing fiction and getting into digital access is a big unlock for the Chipotle business. Throughput, reclaiming our throughput capability, is another being unlock and then, obviously, I think making the brand more visible and more resonant with this real campaign is another unlock. So menu will play a role, but I think you're going to find digital and the combination of throughput and reminding people why they love Chipotle are going to be big unlock.\nAnalysts: And, Jack, in the past, you've had these rules of thumbs about margins, restaurant level margins and their commensurate levels of sales per unit.\nExecutives: Menu will play a role, but I think you're going to find digital and the combination of throughput and reminding people why they love Chipotle are going to be big unlock.\nAnalysts: And, Jack, in the past you have these rules of thumbs about margins, restaurant level margins and their commensurate level of sales per unit.\nExecutives: Menu will play a role, but I think you're going to find digital and the combination of throughput and reminding people why they love Chipotle are going to be big unlock.\nAnalysts: And, Jack, in the past, you've had these rules of thumbs [Audio Gap] menu price increase but if we can use well-thought-out menu price increases to make sure that we manage labor inflation, the model is still intact, and there's efficiencies of moving our customers from the frontline to the second make-line, and then as a matter of working with our delivery partners to make sure that the economics work for both us and them. But everything I've said in the past dated, still intact.\nOperator: The next question will come from Karen Holthouse of Goldman Sachs.\nAnalysts: Two quick housekeeping questions, and I have another one. What was the actual cost and a manager conference in this quarter? And what are you working for, for the stock comp for the year?\nExecutives: What was the number for the conference?\nExecutives: It was like $11 -- $10 million on the quarter, $11 million for the year. Stock comp for the year is in the between $60 million and $65 million.\nAnalysts: And then as we've started to see some of the marketing digital initiatives take hold, is there anything you're seeing in terms of regional variations in the comp performance? And what I'm really kind of getting at are our markets at night competition in sort of the overall casual space and specifically with concepts that share a lot of the same philosophies and values around food quality and sourcing. Are those regions keeping pace with the system?\nExecutives: Yes, we're not seeing big variations in performance based on the initiatives that we've rolled out to date. And when we've done our stage date process, we try to be true to, representing the United States, so we get a picture of how this performs across the country. So, no, we've not seen that issue.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Matt McGinley of Evercore ISI.\nAnalysts: On the liberate in the quarter, you did a good job of managing that relative to what you anticipate or total would be in July, what improved relative to what you assumed back in July?\nExecutives: I missed the first part of your question. Sorry, you cut out.\nAnalysts: The labor rate looks better than you had got in the July, I'm curious what came in better than we you anticipated from the labor standpoint?\nExecutives: Yes, two things. Our team worked really hard to manage workers' comp and workers' comp is something that you don't see the benefit week-by-week or month-by-month, but we saw steady progress throughout the year, and so we're able to make an adjustment there. And then secondly, Scott, and the team, they challenged the team during the third quarter to really take a close look at staffing and make sure you got the right people throughout the day, and so we saw some efficiency gains throughout the quarter as well. So those are the two things, and I agree with you, that we did a nicer job with labor in the third quarter than we did in the second quarter.\nAnalysts: In the quarter, you were in a few offers to grow digital usage I think you had the free delivery offer, did that have any impact on the margin and is this promotion something that you would use on go-forward basis to drive utilization of that, or would expect it to be more of just a more natural increase in digital usage as awareness of the platform builds?\nExecutives: Let me answer the latter part of the question, and I can hand it back to Jack on your margin question. But yes, we have seen is when we increase awareness of the digital platforms, we get a good response. And I think over time, our loyalty program in using analytics to inform how we incentivize behaviors is going to be the future. You'll see us continue to use, but I will call, broad scale incentives as we build the database and get people into our loyalty program, get people using the mobile app but where we're ultimately headed is, we want, I think we're less than 50% awareness on these\n[Audio Gap]\nExecutives: We need to improve that dramatically we need to create capability around using analytics to drive the right incentives with the right cohort at the right time. So with that approach, we think good things happen throughout the entire P&L but, Jack, I don't know what you want to add anything else.\nExecutives: Yes, it does have the theoretical impact on our margin. We gave away guacamole. Guacamole, our customers love it. It comes more than 50% of our transactions, and we gave away a lot of it that we plan to get away from 1, we gave it away for 2 days, but not anything that I would call out when you look at $1.2 billion in sales over the entire quarter. It wasn't material enough to look at. But it can invest more making because we attract a lot of people into our digital platform, and so it's an investment that will pay off. So it has a theoretical impact on the margin but not enough to call out during the quarter.\nOperator: The next question will come from Jeffrey Bernstein of Barclays.\nAnalysts: Two questions. One, just following up on the discussion. Clearly, you're up in the absolute number in '19. I was wondering how you actually arrive at that absolute number? I mean, you talked about having lots of opportunities in different types of stores that you could do, and I know a few years back, you are doing well north of 200 stores a year. So I'm wondering how you think about maybe what are the guardrails or challenges to a greater stairstep in growth? And if you think there's certain market saturation? Or is it real estate availability? Or close to build? Or quality of managers? I'm just wondering what keeps you from ramping up that number more meaningfully in the short term?\nExecutives: Look, I think 1 of the things that always have to go hand-in-hand with new restaurants is having managers ready to take over those new restaurants. So you have to take it at a measured pace as we increase year-to-year because unless you want to be doing is opening restaurants ahead of your capability to run them. The good news is, I think our economic models suggest we still have room to grow in a meaningful way. And the Chipotle employee value proposition is very compelling, we're able to attract managers, apprentices who get them prepared and develop so that they can be a part of the growth story as well. So it's really that is that balancing act. If you got to have the teams ready to work and leave the restaurant, coupled with making sure you got the right economic sites available to open them. You can't just all of a sudden, well, you could, but we're not going to just go guardrails a guardrail on the same. I think we would find ourselves not executing very well. So those are the principles we're using.\nAnalysts: Got it. And then you've mentioned the unlocks earlier, which I thought was interesting. You didn't mention anything about I guess, maybe store hours, in other words, to selling breeders earlier in the day are going to have breakfast, I know certain markets we are now doing more late-night initiatives. I'm just wondering how you assess what extended hours might work, what might not work in the potential opportunity?\nExecutives: Yes, I think 1 of the things we learned through the stage day process is ours is going to be a surgical approach. It's not a once initiative. And so in the light of that, we learned that. In Highlands as opposed on a national level. So you'll see our hours be very surgical. Where it makes sense, you'll see us at different hours, but it's not going to be a national effort.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Brian Niccol for any closing remarks.\nExecutives: Okay. Thanks, everybody, for listening and joining in. I think, as I've said in my early remarks, very proud of what this team has accomplished in the third quarter. I do believe our strategy to win today and cultivate the future is making tremendous progress. The team that we're building in the support center, I am very excited about diversity of the talent and the caliber of the talent. I'm also very excited about how we've moved all these initiatives forward, while moving the company to a new cultural space through this relocation and restructuring. So the Chipotle brand continues to be a purpose-driven brand that we continue to learn over and over again, it means a lot to our customers, it means a lot our team members and very proud of what we've accomplished to date and also very optimistic about the pipeline that we're building and the initiatives that we focused on going forward. So thank you for taking the time and look forward to speaking to all of you in the future. Take care.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

We refer you to the risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K as updated and our subsequent Form 10-Qs for discussion of these risks.\nOur discussion today will also include non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations of which can be found on the Presentation page of the Investor Relations section of our website, which can be found at the link included on the Presentation page.\nI'd also like to remind everyone that we have adopted a self-imposed quiet period, restricting communications with investors during that period. The quiet period will begin on the 16th day of the last month of each fiscal quarter and continues until the next earnings conference call. For the fourth quarter of 2018, it will begin December 16 and continue through our fourth quarter earnings release.\nWe will start today's call with some prepared remarks from Brian Niccol, Chief Executive Officer; and Jack Hartung, Chief Financial Officer, after which we will take questions. Our entire executive leadership team is available during the Q&A period. \nAnd now I will turn the call over to Brian Niccol.\nExecutives: Thanks, Coralie, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report our third quarter results, which demonstrated that our strategy to win today and cultivate a better future are working. Total overall sales grew 8.6% to $1.2 billion, driven by comparable restaurant sales increases of 4.4% and 28 new restaurants opened in the quarter. The positive comp sales trend enabled us to expand restaurant-level margin, which were up 260 basis points year-over-year to 18.7%. Earnings per share adjusted for unusual costs grew 62% to $2.16, and our GAAP earnings were $1.36.\nWhile the quarter experienced some sales headwinds, we had a noticeable lift in sales with the launch of our new For Real marketing campaign in late September. And that increase has sustained through October. Marketing that drives culture, drives difference and drives purchase, combined with great operations, drives results.\nAdditionally in Q3, key growth initiatives moved forward at a healthy pace, and the team executed with excellence the relocation, the restructuring, the hiring of new talent and our All Managers' Conference. We exit the quarter with momentum, which sets us up for a solid fourth quarter, and we remain focused on building a culture of innovation and great execution that will drive sustainable long-term growth.\nBefore I dive deeper into this quarter's great spots, I'd like to take a step back to remind you that our strategy to win today and cultivate the future is based on 5 focus area: one, becoming a more culturally relevant and engaging brand that builds love and loyalty; two, digitizing and modernizing our restaurant experience to create a more convenient and enjoyable guest experience; three, running great restaurants with great hospitality and throughput; four, being disciplined and focused to enhance our powerful economic model; and five, building a great culture that can innovate and execute across digital, access, menu and the restaurant experience.\nThis quarter, we've made strides towards becoming a more culturally relevant and engaging brand. Our For Real campaign celebrates what is uniquely Chipotle, that our food reflects our belief that there's a connection between how food is raised and prepared and how it tastes. Real flavors, real ingredients and real cooking techniques result in food that simply tastes better.\nWe are making much better use of our advertising budget by more effectively communicating who we are and by being in better communication channel, thereby increasing our resonance and visibility. We'll continue to be present on national TV through the middle of November, and the For Real messaging will remain visible in digital and social channels for the balance of the year. Going forward, you can expect Chipotle to have a presence in national media where and when it makes sense and to have an always-on social and digital program.\nWhile we are a brand that speaks to everyone, our consumer research tells us that we are particularly relevant to millennials and Gen Z consumers who share our values, and our customers also want to be our employee. During September, we hosted our All Managers' Conference, and it was clear from looking at our general managers and field leaders in the audience that they reflect our customer base. Our teams came away from this conference energized around our purpose, our values and our goals and ready to get back to their restaurants armed with inspiration and information on how to improve the hiring experience, the training experience and the guest experience.\nIn Q3, we made progress on our purpose of cultivating a better world with the announcement of a new accelerated program called the Chipotle Aluminaries Project. This is funded by our Chipotle Cultivate Foundation to help food-focused, growth-stage ventures that share our belief of cultivating a better world and are seeking to disrupt the current food landscape and take their business to the next level.\nWe are using insights from our consumer research to refine our innovation pipeline and how we communicate with our guests. We continue to hear that the #1 reason that consumers eat elsewhere is because they don't have convenient access to Chipotle. Expanding the reach of our digital system remains a key priority in providing our guests with easier access and greater convenience. The digitized second make-lines are now in nearly 750 restaurants and continue to be on track to be in all restaurants by the end of next year. The digital pickup shelves are now in nearly 350 restaurants, and we are moving quickly to get them in all our restaurants before the middle of 2019.\nWe continued to build momentum in digital this quarter, with digital sales growing 48%, accelerating from the year-over-year growth rate we saw in the first half of this year and now accounting for 11.2% of sales. App downloads have increased 25% since last quarter, and we are seeing strong interest from new and infrequent customers as well as frequent customers.\nAs was the case last quarter, we are seeing particularly strong momentum from delivery. In Q2, we added DoorDash's new partner, and in Q3, we added delivery capabilities directly from our app and website. A free delivery promotion from our app in September drove an acceleration in delivery sales in the quarter. We continue to see good incrementality in delivery, and we see very little customer overlap between our own in-app delivery and our third-party delivery partner app. We are pleased with how delivery in our app is attracting and retaining new and lapsed customers, and the results we're seeing across our delivery channels validate our strategy to be available wherever and however our guests want to access us.\nAs we continue to remove friction from the digital ordering and pickup process, we would expect our delivery time advantage to continue to widen. Our current average delivery time is under 30 minutes, already making us one of the most attractive choices for customers on our delivery partner's website, and this will keep getting better.\nAs part of our goal to increase access, we are also exploring new format that leverages digitally enabled convenience. We're pleased with the early results from our initial digital pickup lane restaurants, and we will expand this test to additional new restaurants in 2019 across several markets. These restaurants have a convenient drive-up window for guests to pick up digital orders. It's clear from this test that our guests appreciate the added convenience as these restaurants generate digital sales that are far above our national average. This format is also a win for operations as the window leverages are digital make-line.\nWe're also excited about our loyalty test, which launched in September in pretest market. It's very early, but sign-ups look promising, and we'll evaluate and learn from the loyalty test as it moves to the stage gate in preparation for national launch during 2019.\nWe also have a number of menu items going through our new stage-gate process so that we can build a pipeline for future years. We're testing quesadillas, nachos, bacon, lemonade and a Mexican chocolate milkshake, for example. These items are in different phases of the stage-gate process.\nImportantly, we're improving our ability to deliver great innovations for our customers and restaurant teams with the new concept of screening process, more consumer insight and a better cross-functional process from idea at the launch.\nLastly, I'd like to touch on where we are in our organizational transformation. At our All Managers' Conference last month, we rolled out our new values. These are: one, the line is the moment of truth; two, teach and taste Chipotle; three, authenticity lives here; and four, the movement is real. These values were very well received at the conference by restaurant managers who are more energized than ever. We also emphasized the following key areas for operations to focus on going forward: number one, throughput excellence; number two, team stability and development; number three, great-tasting food; and number four, great customer hospitality. We did a number of store visits following the conference and asked our restaurant managers what they took away. I'm happy to say we are aligned from the support center to each individual restaurant.\nThese values and focus areas also form the foundation for the culture we are building in our support centers, which exist to serve our general managers and team members so that they can delight our guests. I'm pleased with the significant progress we've made in rebuilding Chipotle into an organization with an inclusive culture that sets us up to be more innovative, more connected to what our guests want and better at executing so that we can capitalize on the tremendous growth opportunities in front of us.\nI'm delighted with the great talent that we are attracting as well as the talent that we're relocating. We've continued to enhance our leadership team, adding Roger Theodoredis as General Counsel, who joined us from WhiteWave. The restructuring and the relocations are nearing completion, and we are building an organization with best-in-class and diverse talent. I love the start-up energy. It greets me every day I come in.\nFinally, before I turn it over to Jack, I want to thank all of our team members across the company that are providing our guests with a great experience, serving real food cooked to perfection and prepared in our restaurants with fresh ingredients. I'd also like to thank our general managers who collectively do a great job managing the restaurant P&L during quarter 3, enabling Chipotle to deliver on financial commitment.\nOkay, over to you, Jack.\nExecutives: Thanks, Brian. I'm equally pleased with how our team's [indiscernible] and didn't miss a beat despite managing a significant restructuring to deliver a solid quarter and great sales momentum that is carried into the fourth quarter. We generated revenue of $1.2 billion during the quarter, an increase of 8.6% from last year on comp sales growth of 4.4%. Restaurant-level margins of 18.7% expanded 260 basis points from last year, contributing to underlying earnings per share, adjusted for unusual items, up 62% to $2.16. The third quarter had unusual expenses, mostly related to the transformation, and that negatively impacted our tax rate and our earnings per share by about $0.80, leading to GAAP earnings per share of $1.36. As discussed last quarter, we'll continue to see costs over the next few quarters associated with our restructuring, relocation and underperforming store closures.\nIn Q3, we recognized $26 million in total charges, with $10 million related to underperforming or closed restaurant and $16 million related to the organizational restructuring and other unusual expenses. As a result of the transformation as well as noncash tax item, our reported effective tax rate increased to 36.8% or about 690 basis points higher than underlying effective tax rate of 29.9%, which I'll explain later.\nThe Q3 comp of 4.4% was primarily driven by higher average check from the price increase taken last November and January and, to a lesser extent, the addition of queso to our menu. During the quarter, comps were in the mid-single digits during July and August before softening to low single digits in September when we compared to the advertised launch of queso in 2017. With the launch of our For Real campaign with national TV in late September, comps moved back up and are running 4% so far in October. Looking to Q4, we'll lap the price increase in about 1,000 restaurants in November, which will be a headwind to our overall Q4 comp by about 100 basis points.\nWe would typically provide a first glance of our comp guidance for 2019 right now, but with a growing pipeline of initiatives still early on in the stage-gate process, we'll hold off in providing 2019 comp guidance until we have a better perspective of the timing and expected impact of each of these initiatives.\nWe opened 28 new restaurants in the quarter and continue to expect to be at the lower end of our 130 to 150 new openings guidance for the full year. Our new restaurants this year have opened at stronger levels, and we continue to emphasize high-quality, high returning new restaurants as we build out the pipeline. As a result of the strong [indiscernible] economics, combined with a healthy pipeline for next year's opening, we expect to open between 140 to 155 new restaurants in 2019.\nAs mentioned on our last call, we expect to close between 55 and 65 underperforming restaurants. In the third quarter, we closed 32 of these restaurants and 38 in total, including the 6 closed in Q2, all related to the restructuring. The remaining underperforming restaurants will close over the next several quarters as we pursue strategic alternatives to manage our future rent liability.\nFood costs for the quarter were 33.4%, a decrease of 160 basis points from the 35% in Q3 of last year. The decrease from last year was driven by the menu price increase as well as more favorable avocado prices. These were offset by elevated prices for beef and paper and packaging items. We expect to be in the low 33% range in Q4, with a slight decrease from Q3 due to the shift in the supply of avocados back to Mexico [indiscernible].\nLabor costs for the quarter were 27.2% or flat compared to Q3 of last year. The price increase offset wage inflation of about 4% to 5%. We also decreased our workers' comp liability by about $4 million in the quarter due to better management of claims activity so far this year. We expect labor costs to increase to the mid-28% range in Q4 as a result of deleverage from seasonally lower sales as well as continued wage pressure.\nOccupancy costs for the quarter were 7.1%, a decrease of 30 basis points compared to Q3 last year, and that's due mostly to the increase in comp sales.\nOther operating costs for the quarter were 13.7%, a decrease of 70 basis points from Q3 of last year.\nOur marketing and promo costs were 2.5% in the quarter, a decrease of about 70 basis points compared to Q3 of last year. The lower-than-expected marketing in Q3 is due to a timing shift into Q4 as our For Real campaign began in late September and will continue through mid-November. As a result, we expect marketing and promo costs will be in the low 4% of sales during Q4, while full year marketing and promo will still be right around 3% of sales overall for the year.\nOther operating costs continue to include about 30 basis points of higher maintenance and repair costs, which we first discussed on the Q4 2017 call, and we expect M&R to continue at this elevated level for the rest of the year before abating in 2019.\nG&A in the quarter increased $24 million compared to Q2 of this year. The increase compared to last quarter was primarily due to $16 million in charges related to the restructuring and other unusual charges in the quarter as well as $11 million for our biennial All Managers' Conference. Compared to Q3 of last year, the items I just listed mostly offset the onetime charge we had in same quarter of last year.\nUnderlying G&A increased compared to last year, primarily in support of our restaurant growth and digitizing our restaurant experience and operational leadership changes in the field. For Q4, we expect total G&A to be right around $95 million, which includes an estimated $10 million to $12 million of restructuring-related expenses. Underlying G&A in Q4, excluding bonuses and stock comp, is expected to be at similar levels as Q2 and Q3 of this year. However, both bonuses and stock comp are expected to be higher year-over-year as a result of better performance.\nDepreciation for the quarter was 4.3%, an increase of 60 basis points from the 3.7% in Q3 of last year. This increase is due to the accelerated depreciation for the restaurant closures we discussed earlier and, to a lesser extent, accelerated depreciation from the office closures.\nWe now expect transformation costs from restructuring and restaurant closures and certain other charges to total between $100 million and $120 million versus our initial estimate of $115 million to $135 million, again, with most hitting into 2018. So far this year, we charged nearly $70 million, and we estimate that another $10 million to $25 million will hit in Q4. And the remaining charges, mostly related to terminating restaurant and office leases, will spill into 2019. We'll continue to provide specific and future transformation-related costs when we have more certainty around timing, and we'll break out the unusual costs from normal costs so you can follow the underlying trend.\nOur pretax income was $58.5 million, and the reported effective tax rate was 36.8%. Our 36.8% reported effective tax rate was higher than our 29.9% underlying rate due to the transformation costs and noncash tax items related to the write-off of deferred tax assets associated with underwater option. While we anticipate the underlying rate in Q4 to remain in the 28.9% to 29.9% range, we anticipate our effective Q4 tax rate to be in the high 30% range or higher due to the impact of transformation charges as well as anticipated additional noncash tax write-off.\nDuring the quarter, we repurchased $19 million of our stock at an average price of $474 per share, leaving about $100 million in our current buyback authorization. Our buyback rate will remain at this lower level as we fund the transformation costs. This decrease is short term, and we expect to return opportunistically repurchasing shares at a higher level once we've completed the restructuring.\nWe're encouraged by our third quarter results as our teams demonstrated that they can stay focused on serving our guests and executing growth drivers while also being nimble on managing the business.  Meanwhile, our support center made important progress in relocating and hiring talent, hosting our All Managers' Conference and rebuilding an organizational structure designed to innovate and deliver on commitments to our guests, to our employees and to our shareholders.\nAnd now we're happy to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question will come from David Tarantino of Baird.\nAnalysts: Just a couple of questions on the comp trends. First, Brian or Jack, could you maybe talk about your estimate of the impact, if there was any, from the Ohio incident that was pretty well publicized? And I guess, based on how you look at the business, looking at maybe your average daily sales trends and seasonally adjusted for that, do you think this most recent uplift from the marketing program has got your back on trend if there was an impact in Q3? And then I have a couple of follow-ups.\nExecutives: Yes, David, this is Jack. There was a lot going on in the quarter. We compared in the middle of the quarter to some soft results from the last year. We had avocado day that turned into a double day once we broke the Internet. We had a back-to-school promotion, and we compared to queso, and then we had marketing at the end. So teasing out any single impact was very difficult. That's why I walked through and I wanted to give the comp trends throughout the quarter. The thing that we know for sure is that marketing did have an impact. As we went on air and as customers started seeing the commercials, we did see an improvement in our sales. And I think when I looked through the net-net of it, by the time we left the quarter, I don't think there's any lasting impact of anything that happened in Ohio.\nAnalysts: Great. That's helpful, Jack. And then on the quarter-to-date, you mentioned 4% for the comp. I know you're cycling now the mix benefits you have with the queso. So I guess is traffic now running positive in the quarter-to-date period behind the advertising?\nExecutives: David, it's right around flattish. When you look at the 4%, we're still carrying a price increase, and about a couple thousand restaurants will lap the next wave in November and then the final wave in January. So I've called the traffic right around flat.\nAnalysts: Great. And then last question for Brian. You talked a lot about the stage-gate process with some of the menu innovation you're working on. So I guess, at a high level, when do you think we'll start seeing some new items added to the menu? And then if you can maybe share your perspective on what you've learned in adding new items to the menu and the operating model.\nExecutives: Sure. So yes, we've got, obviously, a couple items in the stage-gate process on various stages, actually, both digital initiatives as well as food initiatives. And I think you're going to see both a digital, the total system, from loyalty to our mobile app to our digital shelves, all those things are in test markets right now, and we're very optimistic about what we're seeing. And we're continuing to learn. And the plan is they will start to touch, in 2019, consumers. Same thing with a food initiative or 2. So we're still early days, David, but we're learning a lot. We're optimistic about what we're seeing. And we're feeling like the stage-gate process is working, and it's going to set us up to execute with excellence when some of these initiatives come to market in 2019.\nOperator: The next question will come from John Glass of Morgan Stanley.\nAnalysts: Could you -- there were a couple of operational initiatives, Brian, you talked about, either on or off-line, during the quarter, including throughput, seemed like an early opportunity for you. And I think you talked about maybe purchasing [indiscernible] in that organization. So some of the operational things that you're taking on, where are you on those? And do they have any impact on the past quarter?\nExecutives: So we are early days into both of those. And the good news is, I would say, our operational focus, I feel like we're out of the starting blocks with getting our throughput to a higher level than where we'd been. But really, our focus was, at our All Managers' Conference, to get everybody aligned on values so that we're hiring the right people, so that ultimately, we can end up with a stable team with the right leaders. And then the other key focus for that meeting was to make sure people understood we're getting back to the throughput excellence, great-tasting food. You do those 2 things, you end up with great customer hospitality. And what I love is I feel like we're out of blocks in all these things, and we should -- as we go into 2019, we'll continue to make progress as opposed to just getting started with it in 2019. And the same thing goes for the supply chain leadership. Carlos, actually, myself and Jack, we've already started our visits with some of our key partners, and it's been great to understand the relationship that was started, in some cases, 25 years ago to some that are relatively new. And the good news is I think this is an [indiscernible] process where there's opportunities for Chipotle and our suppliers to benefit going forward. So very optimistic on both of those fronts, and I feel like a lot of good work has been put in place so that when we walk into 2019, we'll start to see some real tangible benefits.\nAnalysts: Just one more for me. On the digital sales growth this quarter, which is impressive, do you -- are you seeing the operational benefits you hoped, particularly some of maybe the margin benefit you hoped utilizing the second make-line? Or is it too early and you have to get sort of a threshold of volume going through that second make-line to really start to see some of the margin leverage benefit that you might expect?\nExecutives: Yes. I think it's a little too early on the margin side of it. But one of the things that's been great to see is where we have the digital make-line, where we have our shelves, and you got this -- obviously, the customer app everywhere, we're seeing increases in customer satisfaction, and we're continuing to see a higher ticket, and it's playing across all those digital channels that you'd expect, the app, the web and in delivery.\nOperator: The next question will come from Nicole Miller of Piper Jaffray.\nAnalysts: It seems to me you've had -- or you're in the midst of a headquarter cultural residing combination with what is store alignment, actually very powerful. So I'm curious, what are today's store-level incentive metrics? And I've noticed on some of my visits some customer contacts in the dining room. And I'm wondering, is that the particular element that you're focusing on?\nExecutives: Yes, absolutely. We are very much focused on -- we want people to walk away from Chipotle with a [indiscernible] guest experience. And I think you heard me mention is when we say the line is the moment of truth, we believe the whole stage is set from the second you see our line. And those are both digital lines as well as our customer-facing line. And I think what Scott and his team have been also focused on is we got to make sure our hospitality matches that client experience. So you will see some table touches. You'll see what Scott calls his 4 cornerstones start to roll out across the system. So I'm delighted to hear that you're seeing that firsthand.\nAnalysts: And could you speak more specifically about the incentive metrics for the store-level employees?\nExecutives: Sure. We can talk a little bit more about that. Scott, I don't know if you want to chime in here, but this is all based on our restaurant AB scorecard. So much [indiscernible].\nExecutives: Scott here. Yes, so our incentives currently are tied to our AB scorecard, which encompasses sales and profits, obviously, but also incorporates the guest experience, food safety, obviously, being paramount to our business. As -- and so when we lathered that up, we understand where we are from a business unit perspective. And everyone is driving to reach the A level. We've had -- we've made great progress this year of getting there. So hopefully, that answers your question around incentives specifically.\nAnalysts: That's very helpful. And then just the last question. Brian, when you first talked to us a couple of conference calls ago, you talked a lot about enhancing and aiding the Chipotle awareness. And today, I heard you talk about customers wanting accessibility. So could you compare and contrast those opportunities? And how are you approaching and prioritizing the strategies and tactics between those 2 opportunities?\nExecutives: Yes. I think you picked up on what I think are the 2 biggest levers outside of our operational excellence, around throughput and great hospitality. I think what you just saw with the For Real marketing campaign -- and this is what I meant by being more visible and also being more focused on what makes Chipotle uniquely different. So you're going to continue to see us push very hard on getting across what makes Chipotle different, what makes Chipotle driving culture, food culture, and then obviously, we want our marketing to be driving the purchase as well. And I think that can be done at the brand level, which is very exciting for Chipotle because I think our purpose is powerful. The other big lever for us is access, and I think it's going to be driven by this digital access. So those are 2 things that we are very focused on getting front and center. And then, obviously, I think there are opportunities for many variety and few other things that we talked about. But the 2 biggest focus areas here in the very near term are the visibility of the Chipotle brand and purpose because I think we're creating a new category with folks and changing food culture. And we're much more visible with the customer's response, and then the digital access aspect is another place where we're seeing great response across that whole digital system that we're rolling out.\nAnalysts: So is it fair maybe for us to think about awareness is really generating the call to action and that access to distribution reducing the friction to get to you? Is that right?\nExecutives: Yes, well said. I should have started there.\nOperator: The next question will come from Sara Senatore of Bernstein.\nAnalysts: I have 2 follow-ups. One, just on traffic. I think in the past, we've heard there's been a bit of a struggle with frequency in the sense of just all tiers of customer maybe coming a little bit less. And I was wondering if you could talk about what you're seeing there. Is this where loyalty comes in? Or is it the new menu items that will bring people back more frequently? So besides access, what are customers telling you that they want to see most in order to sort of ramp up that frequency curve, which used to be such a tailwind to the Chipotle comp? And then I have another one.\nExecutives: Sure. So yes, what we've seen, and this is early days, is with our loyalty pilot, we're seeing people that have less frequency answering the program. And we don't have enough time to truly understand what ultimately is going to be the impact on our frequency, but we're very excited about the cohort that we're seeing come in to the loyalty program in the early days. So we think that is going to play out, where that program will be a vehicle for driving frequency among the cohort, but today, have an opportunity to increase the frequency. Another thing that's really been exciting is a lot of our digital business is attracting new and lapsed users to our business. So that's been another really exciting learning for us. And then I think your point on what about the people that historically were coming all the time, I think that's where we need to get back to talking about what makes Chipotle unique in culture, visible food culture, what makes our purpose so different because that really resonates with our heavy users that are bought in. And we've seen some early indications that, that's a great way to drive frequency into our loyalists.\nAnalysts: That's helpful. And then just on the unit, you were sort of at the low end of the range this year but obviously will be above that in fiscal '19, according to the guidance. I'm just trying to understand the extent to which this year's build rate was maybe a function of just reestablishing your growth pipeline or your development, kind of how you approach it versus just the -- how many attractive trade areas are left. Next year, I guess, would we expect to see more of a mix shift towards some of the newer or less established? Or are you going to continue to mostly focus on these established markets?\nExecutives: I'll answer, and then I'll let Jack chime in as well. But yes, look, what we're really excited about is the restaurants that we opened this year opened very strong. And the economic support continuing to open Chipotle restaurants above the rate of which we opened this year. And I think that was the guidance which I shared with you all. The thing that's also exciting about Chipotle is we're finding we're having success in some new formats. As I've mentioned in the earlier statements, the digital pickup lane is a very exciting proposition. We're going to do more of those next year. We're also very excited about how we're seeing success in proven markets and the new markets that we got the brakes on, frankly, a while ago. But the economic model of new restaurant openings is very powerful, and as such, we are building the pipeline accordingly so that where the opportunities present itself, we can take advantage of those. Jack, I don't know if you want to add anything.\nExecutives: Yes. The only thing, Brian, I would add is, Sara, we did increase the quality this year, and that showed. We've got better economics this year than we have in the past few. We were more discerning. We were more selective. We did focus more of our attention in the proven and fully developed markets. But we also had great success in some of the new and developing. So I think by being discerning, both in our proven markets and our developing and new markets, we've got better quality. I think that sets the table now for us to take the stair step up that we talked about next year. And I fully expect that if we continue to build this kind of quality, work for another stair step the year after. So we focus on quality first, and then quantity, second.\nOperator: The next question will come from Andy Barish of Jefferies.\nAnalysts: Just wondering if you could -- I know you've probably given us a bunch of thoughts coming out of your consumer research. But more importantly, on pricing for next year, any initial conclusions on sort of how you're going to approach pricing versus the historical practice of kind of a larger price increase every several years?\nExecutives: I'll let Jack take that.\nExecutives: Yes, Andy, we have mentioned on previous calls, we're open to a whole different approach. We're in the early stages of talking to some outside parties about our menu compared to competition, customers that shop within our menu and are there opportunities. And I think you'll more likely see us take smaller price increases rather than wait 2 or 3 years or so and then take a larger one, but nothing to report right now.\nAnalysts: Okay. And then just a quick follow-up on -- again, looking out to next year, having For Real for the full year, how do you anticipate sort of the marketing windows to kind of fall versus, obviously, the late roll this year?\nExecutives: Yes. So we are still in the planning phases on exactly when and where we want to use national media. But what we feel really good about is we believe we've got the right communication, and now we're working through how we use the right communication vehicles at the right time. But what we do know is we'll have an always-on social, mobile, digital effort, and then we're still working through how we use the traditional mediums throughout the year in 2019.\nOperator: The next question comes from Sharon Zackfia of William Blair.\nAnalysts: I guess just a follow-up to Andy's question. 3% for marketing, I mean, how are you arriving at that as the right number? And how do we think about that going into 2019?\nExecutives: Yes. So we believe 3% is the right number based on what our planning process is sharing with us. We're using our stage-gate process to really understand what does each initiative provide as far as growth goes, layered on top of our throughput effort. And what we've seen is, as of right now, as we reapproach the marketing budget, we're going to change the allocation from a lot of local marketing to more national. And in that switch, it changes the level of visibility that we can achieve with our marketing dollar. So I think you'll -- what should happen is our 3% should feel like we're much bigger than what our 3% has been historically. And that's our ingoing assumption. Obviously, if we find through our stage-gate process that we have an opportunity to enhance the marketing because the result matches the increased investment, then we'll do that opportunistically. But the going-in plan is to make more out of the 3% than we have in the past.\nAnalysts: Can I ask just a quick follow-up? For 2018, what percent of that marketing budget is digital?\nExecutives: Chris, do you know that off the top of your head?\nExecutives: It's -- so -- I don't know the answer off the top, and I don't know that we necessarily want to give everybody a clue into that. But clearly, with our consumer base going more millennial and more Gen Z, that digital is an integral part of the program for us. And one of the things, we have a lot of things going on with stage gate in terms of 5 initiatives but even the media that we're running. We're constantly in the state of where we look at how it goes and how we evaluate it and to how it moves the business, and we'll feel free to shift things between more traditional linear media and digital media as the results warrant.\nOperator: The next question will come from David Palmer of RBC Capital Markets.\nAnalysts: A couple of follow-ups for me as well. You talked about operations, digital menu innovation, and obviously, you've done a lot of research and testing. But if you were to sort of rank your biggest bucket or buckets of opportunity from this point, how would you do that in terms of what is going to be the biggest source of improvement? I think the assumption might be new menu news being the unlock from here, but I wanted to hear your thoughts.\nExecutives: Yes, look, I don't think new menu news is the primary unlock. I think it plays a role, but I think the digital access, removing fiction and getting into digital access is a big unlock for the Chipotle business. Throughput, reclaiming our throughput capability, is another big unlock. And then, obviously, I think making the brand more visible and more resonant with this For Real campaign is another unlock. So menu will play a role, but I think you're going to find digital and the combination of throughput and reminding people why they love Chipotle are going to be big unlock.\nAnalysts: And, Jack, in the past, you've had these rules of thumbs about margins -- restaurant-level margins and their commensurate level of sales per unit. How has your thinking been changing on that? Obviously, you see innovation deliver your things that bring complexity, and you think that could be margin dilutive. And on the other side, you've talked about productivity, and of course, there's labor inflation and pricing. So how does -- have you really shifted how you think about what margins are possible at what levels of sales?\nExecutives: No, David. We got through and studied this carefully. And I think everything with digital, with delivery, we feel good that there's -- anytime there's an added cost, that there's an opportunity for an efficiency there. So I still think if we get the $2.1 million, we can be in the 21% margin. $2.2 million is at 22% margin. Wage inflation is a bit of a wildcard. We can't overcome that with transaction growth alone. That will require some careful timing and place in the menu price increases. But if we can use well-thought-out menu price increases to make sure that we manage labor inflation, the model is still intact. And there's efficiencies of moving our customers from the front line to the second make-line. And then it's a matter of working with our delivery partners to make sure that the economics work for both us and them. But everything I've said in the past, David, still intact.\nOperator: The next question will come from Karen Holthouse of Goldman Sachs.\nAnalysts: Two quick housekeeping questions, and I have another one. What was the actual cost of the manager conference in the quarter? And what are you working for, for a stock comp for the year?\nExecutives: What was the number for the conference?\nExecutives: It was like $11 -- $10 million in the quarter, $11 million for the year. Stock comp for the year is in the -- between $60 million and $65 million.\nAnalysts: And then as we've started to see some of the marketing digital initiatives take hold, is there anything you're seeing in terms of regional variations in the comp performance? And what I'm really getting at are markets that might be thought of as having more competition in sort of the overall fast-casual space and, specifically, with concepts that share a lot of the same philosophies and values around food quality and sourcing. Are those regions keeping pace with the system?\nExecutives: Yes. We're not seeing big variations in performance based on the initiatives that we've rolled out to date. And when we've done our stage-gate process, we've tried to be true to representing the full United States, so we get a picture of how this performs across the country. So, no, we've not seen that issue.\nOperator: The next question will come from Matt McGinley of Evercore ISI.\nAnalysts: On the labor rate in the quarter, you did a good job of managing that relative to what you had anticipated your totals would be in July. What improved relative to what you assumed back in July?\nExecutives: I missed the first part of your question. Sorry, you cut out.\nAnalysts: The labor rate looked a little bit better than you had guided in July, and I'm curious what came in better than what you anticipated from a labor standpoint?\nExecutives: Yes. Two things. Our teams worked really hard to manage workers' comp, and workers' comp is something that you don't see the benefit week-by-week or month-by-month, but we saw a steady progress throughout the year, and so we're able to make an adjustment there. And then secondly, Scott and the team, they challenged the team during the third quarter to really take a close look at staffing and making sure you got the right people throughout the day. And so we saw some efficiency gains throughout the quarter as well. So those are the 2 things that -- and I agree with you that we did a nicer job with labor in the third quarter than we did in the second quarter.\nAnalysts: In the quarter, you ran a few offers to grow digital usage. I think you ran a BOGO, and you had the free delivery offer. Did that have any impact on the margin? And is promotion something that you would use on a go-forward basis to drive utilization of that? Or would you expect it to be more of just -- a more natural increase in digital usage as awareness of the platform builds?\nExecutives: Let me answer the latter part of the question, and I can hand it back to Jack on your margin question. But, yes, what we have seen is when we increase awareness of the digital platforms, we get a good response. And I think, over time, our loyalty program and using analytics to inform how we incentivize behaviors is going to be the future. You'll see us continue to use what I will call broad-scale incentives as we build the database and get people into our loyalty program, get people using the mobile app. But where we're ultimately headed is we want -- I think we're less than 50% awareness on these digital platforms. We need to improve that dramatically. And then once we get them into the platform, we need to create a capability around using analytics to drive the right incentives for the right cohort at the right time. So with that approach, we think good things happen throughout the entire P&L. But, Jack, I don't know if you want to add anything else.\nExecutives: Yes. I must add I think it was well said. You answered it. It does have a theoretical impact on our margin. We give away guacamole. Guacamole, our customers love it. It comes with more than 50% of our transactions. And we gave away a lot of it that we planned to giving it away for 1 day, we gave it away for 2 days. But not anything that I would call out when you look at $1.2 billion in sales over the entire quarter. It wasn't material enough to look at. But we can invest more making because we attract a lot of people into our digital platform, and so it's an investment that will pay off. So it has a theoretical impact on the margin but not enough to call out during the quarter.\nOperator: The next question will come from Jeffrey Bernstein of Barclays.\nAnalysts: Two questions. One, just following up on the unit growth discussion. I mean, clearly, you're up in the absolute number in '19. I was wondering how you actually arrived at that absolute number. I mean, you talked about how there's lots of opportunities and different types of stores that you could do, and I know a few years back, you were doing well north of 200 stores a year. So I'm wondering how you think about maybe what are the guardrails or challenges to a greater stair step in growth and if you think there's certain market attrition? Or is it real estate availability or close to build or quality of managers? I'm just wondering what keeps you from ramping up that number more meaningfully in the short term?\nExecutives: Look, I think one of the things that always have to go hand-in-hand with new restaurants is having managers ready to take over those new restaurants. So you have to take it at a measured pace as we increase year-to-year because the last thing you want to be doing is opening restaurants ahead of your capability to run them. The good news is I think our economic models suggest we still have room to grow in a meaningful way. And the Chipotle employee value proposition is very compelling, so we're able to attract managers, apprentices to get them prepared and developed so that they can be a part of the growth story as well. So it's really -- it's that balancing act. So you got to have the teams ready to work and leave the restaurant, coupled with making sure you got the right economic sites available to open them. You can't just all of a sudden -- well, you could, but we're not going to just go guardrail to guardrail on this thing. I think we would find ourselves not executing very well. So those are the principles we're using.\nAnalysts: Got it. And then you mentioned the unlocks earlier, which I thought was interesting. You didn't mention anything about, I guess, maybe extended store hours. I know there was some talk of selling burritos earlier in the day, you're going into breakfast store. I know in certain markets you're now doing more late-night initiatives. I'm just wondering how you assess what extended hours might work, what might not work and the potential opportunity.\nExecutives: Yes, I think one of the things we learned through the stage-gate process is hours is going to be a surgical approach. It's not a once initiative. And so in the light of that, we learned that in pilots as opposed on a national level. So you'll see our hours be very surgical. Where it makes sense, you'll see us at different hours, but it's not going to be a national blunt effort.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Brian Niccol for any closing remarks.\nExecutives: Okay. Thanks to everybody for listening and joining in. I think as I've said in my early remarks, very proud of what this team has accomplished in the third quarter. I do believe our strategy to win today and cultivate the future is making tremendous progress. The team that we're building in the support center, I am very excited about diversity of the talent and the caliber of the talent. I'm also very excited about how we've moved all these initiatives forward while moving the company to a new cultural space through this relocation and restructuring. So the Chipotle brand continues to be a purpose-driven brand that we continue to learn over and over again. It means a lot to our customers. It means a lot to our team members and very proud of what we accomplished to date and also very optimistic about the pipeline that we're building and the initiatives that we're focused on going forward. So thank you for taking the time and look forward to speaking with all of you in the future. Take care.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines. Have a great day.\nOperator: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Chipotle Q3 2018 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Coralie Witter. Please go ahead.\nExecutives: Hi, everyone, and welcome to our call today. By now, you should have access to our earnings announcement released this afternoon for the third quarter of 2018. It may also be found on our Investor Relations website at ir.chipotle.com.\nBefore we begin our presentation, I will remind everyone that parts of our discussion today will include forward-looking statements as defined in the securities laws. These forward-looking statements will include statements regarding our outlook for the fourth quarter; the potential of a number of our digital sales strategies; sales trends and forecasts for future comparable sales; expected new restaurant openings; estimates on future food, labor, marketing and maintenance and repair costs and G&A spend; statements about our expected effective tax rate and projections of the amount and timing of transformation and restructuring costs and stock repurchases; as well as other statements of our expectations and plans.

The quiet period will begin on the 16th day of the last month of each fiscal quarter and continues until the next earnings conference call. For the fourth quarter of 2018, it will begin December 16 and continue through our fourth quarter earnings release.\nWe will start today's call with some prepared remarks from Brian Niccol, Chief Executive Officer; and Jack Hartung, Chief Financial Officer, after which we will take questions. Our entire executive leadership team is available during the Q&A period. \nAnd now I will turn the call over to Brian Niccol.\nExecutives: Thanks, Coralie, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report our third quarter results, which demonstrated that our strategy to win today and cultivate a better future are working. Total overall sales grew 8.6% to $1.2 billion, driven by comparable restaurant sales increases of 4.4% and 28 new restaurants opened in the quarter. The positive comp sales trend enabled us to expand restaurant-level margin, which were up 260 basis points year-over-year to 18.7%. Earnings per share adjusted for unusual costs grew 62% to $2.16, and our GAAP earnings were $1.36.\nWhile the quarter experienced some sales headwinds, we had a noticeable lift in sales with the launch of our new For Real marketing campaign in late September. And that increase has sustained through October. Marketing that drives culture, drives difference and drives purchase, combined with great operations, drives results.\nAdditionally in Q3, key growth initiatives moved forward at a healthy pace, and the team executed with excellence the relocation, the restructuring, the hiring of new talent and our All Managers' Conference. We exit the quarter with momentum, which sets us up for a solid fourth quarter, and we remain focused on building a culture of innovation and great execution that will drive sustainable long-term growth.\nBefore I dive deeper into this quarter's great spots, I'd like to take a step back to remind you that our strategy to win today and cultivate the future is based on 5 focus area: one, becoming a more culturally relevant and engaging brand that builds love and loyalty; two, digitizing and modernizing our restaurant experience to create a more convenient and enjoyable guest experience; three, running great restaurants with great hospitality and throughput; four, being disciplined and focused to enhance our powerful economic model; and five, building a great culture that can innovate and execute across digital, access, menu and the restaurant experience.\nThis quarter, we've made strides towards becoming a more culturally relevant and engaging brand. Our For Real campaign celebrates what is uniquely Chipotle, that our food reflects our belief that there's a connection between how food is raised and prepared and how it tastes. Real flavors, real ingredients and real cooking techniques result in food that simply tastes better.\nWe are making much better use of our advertising budget by more effectively communicating who we are and by being in better communication channel, thereby increasing our resonance and visibility. We'll continue to be present on national TV through the middle of November, and the For Real messaging will remain visible in digital and social channels for the balance of the year. Going forward, you can expect Chipotle to have a presence in national media where and when it makes sense and to have an always-on social and digital program.\nWhile we are a brand that speaks to everyone, our consumer research tells us that we are particularly relevant to millennials and Gen Z consumers who share our values, and our customers also want to be our employee. During September, we hosted our All Managers' Conference, and it was clear from looking at our general managers and field leaders in the audience that they reflect our customer base. Our teams came away from this conference energized around our purpose, our values and our goals and ready to get back to their restaurants armed with inspiration and information on how to improve the hiring experience, the training experience and the guest experience.\nIn Q3, we made progress on our purpose of cultivating a better world with the announcement of a new accelerated program called the Chipotle Aluminaries Project. This is funded by our Chipotle Cultivate Foundation to help food-focused, growth-stage ventures that share our belief of cultivating a better world and are seeking to disrupt the current food landscape and take their business to the next level.\nWe are using insights from our consumer research to refine our innovation pipeline and how we communicate with our guests. We continue to hear that the #1 reason that consumers eat elsewhere is because they don't have convenient access to Chipotle. Expanding the reach of our digital system remains a key priority in providing our guests with easier access and greater convenience. The digitized second make-lines are now in nearly 750 restaurants and continue to be on track to be in all restaurants by the end of next year. The digital pickup shelves are now in nearly 350 restaurants, and we are moving quickly to get them in all our restaurants before the middle of 2019.\nWe continued to build momentum in digital this quarter, with digital sales growing 48%, accelerating from the year-over-year growth rate we saw in the first half of this year and now accounting for 11.2% of sales. App downloads have increased 25% since last quarter, and we are seeing strong interest from new and infrequent customers as well as frequent customers.\nAs was the case last quarter, we are seeing particularly strong momentum from delivery. In Q2, we added DoorDash's new partner, and in Q3, we added delivery capabilities directly from our app and website. A free delivery promotion from our app in September drove an acceleration in delivery sales in the quarter. We continue to see good incrementality in delivery, and we see very little customer overlap between our own in-app delivery and our third-party delivery partner app. We are pleased with how delivery in our app is attracting and retaining new and lapsed customers, and the results we're seeing across our delivery channels validate our strategy to be available wherever and however our guests want to access us.\nAs we continue to remove friction from the digital ordering and pickup process, we would expect our delivery time advantage to continue to widen. Our current average delivery time is under 30 minutes, already making us one of the most attractive choices for customers on our delivery partner's website, and this will keep getting better.\nAs part of our goal to increase access, we are also exploring new format that leverages digitally enabled convenience. We're pleased with the early results from our initial digital pickup lane restaurants, and we will expand this test to additional new restaurants in 2019 across several markets. These restaurants have a convenient drive-up window for guests to pick up digital orders. It's clear from this test that our guests appreciate the added convenience as these restaurants generate digital sales that are far above our national average. This format is also a win for operations as the window leverages are digital make-line.\nWe're also excited about our loyalty test, which launched in September in pretest market. It's very early, but sign-ups look promising, and we'll evaluate and learn from the loyalty test as it moves to the stage gate in preparation for national launch during 2019.\nWe also have a number of menu items going through our new stage-gate process so that we can build a pipeline for future years. We're testing quesadillas, nachos, bacon, lemonade and a Mexican chocolate milkshake, for example. These items are in different phases of the stage-gate process.\nImportantly, we're improving our ability to deliver great innovations for our customers and restaurant teams with the new concept of screening process, more consumer insight and a better cross-functional process from idea at the launch.\nLastly, I'd like to touch on where we are in our organizational transformation. At our All Managers' Conference last month, we rolled out our new values. These are: one, the line is the moment of truth; two, teach and taste Chipotle; three, authenticity lives here; and four, the movement is real. These values were very well received at the conference by restaurant managers who are more energized than ever. We also emphasized the following key areas for operations to focus on going forward: number one, throughput excellence; number two, team stability and development; number three, great-tasting food; and number four, great customer hospitality. We did a number of store visits following the conference and asked our restaurant managers what they took away. I'm happy to say we are aligned from the support center to each individual restaurant.\nThese values and focus areas also form the foundation for the culture we are building in our support centers, which exist to serve our general managers and team members so that they can delight our guests. I'm pleased with the significant progress we've made in rebuilding Chipotle into an organization with an inclusive culture that sets us up to be more innovative, more connected to what our guests want and better at executing so that we can capitalize on the tremendous growth opportunities in front of us.\nI'm delighted with the great talent that we are attracting as well as the talent that we're relocating. We've continued to enhance our leadership team, adding Roger Theodoredis as General Counsel, who joined us from WhiteWave. The restructuring and the relocations are nearing completion, and we are building an organization with best-in-class and diverse talent. I love the start-up energy. It greets me every day I come in.\nFinally, before I turn it over to Jack, I want to thank all of our team members across the company that are providing our guests with a great experience, serving real food cooked to perfection and prepared in our restaurants with fresh ingredients. I'd also like to thank our general managers who collectively do a great job managing the restaurant P&L during quarter 3, enabling Chipotle to deliver on financial commitment.\nOkay, over to you, Jack.\nExecutives: Thanks, Brian. I'm equally pleased with how our team rose to the occasion and didn't miss a beat despite managing a significant restructuring to deliver a solid quarter and great sales momentum that is carried into the fourth quarter. We generated revenue of $1.2 billion during the quarter, an increase of 8.6% from last year on comp sales growth of 4.4%. Restaurant-level margins of 18.7% expanded 260 basis points from last year, contributing to underlying earnings per share, adjusted for unusual items, up 62% to $2.16. The third quarter had unusual expenses, mostly related to the transformation, and that negatively impacted our tax rate and our earnings per share by about $0.80, leading to GAAP earnings per share of $1.36. As discussed last quarter, we'll continue to see costs over the next few quarters associated with our restructuring, relocation and underperforming store closures.\nIn Q3, we recognized $26 million in total charges, with $10 million related to underperforming or closed restaurant and $16 million related to the organizational restructuring and other unusual expenses. As a result of the transformation as well as noncash tax item, our reported effective tax rate increased to 36.8% or about 690 basis points higher than underlying effective tax rate of 29.9%, which I'll explain later.\nThe Q3 comp of 4.4% was primarily driven by higher average check from the price increase taken last November and January and, to a lesser extent, the addition of queso to our menu. During the quarter, comps were in the mid-single digits during July and August before softening to low single digits in September when we compared to the advertised launch of queso in 2017. With the launch of our For Real campaign with national TV in late September, comps moved back up and are running 4% so far in October. Looking to Q4, we'll lap the price increase in about 1,000 restaurants in November, which will be a headwind to our overall Q4 comp by about 100 basis points.\nWe would typically provide a first glance of our comp guidance for 2019 right now, but with a growing pipeline of initiatives still early on in the stage-gate process, we'll hold off in providing 2019 comp guidance until we have a better perspective of the timing and expected impact of each of these initiatives.\nWe opened 28 new restaurants in the quarter and continue to expect to be at the lower end of our 130 to 150 new openings guidance for the full year. Our new restaurants this year have opened at stronger levels, and we continue to emphasize high-quality, high returning new restaurants as we build out the pipeline. As a result of the strong unit economics, combined with a healthy pipeline for next year's opening, we expect to open between 140 to 155 new restaurants in 2019.\nAs mentioned on our last call, we expect to close between 55 and 65 underperforming restaurants. In the third quarter, we closed 32 of these restaurants and 38 in total, including the 6 closed in Q2, all related to the restructuring. The remaining underperforming restaurants will close over the next several quarters as we pursue strategic alternatives to manage our future rent liability.\nFood costs for the quarter were 33.4%, a decrease of 160 basis points from the 35% in Q3 of last year. The decrease from last year was driven by the menu price increase as well as more favorable avocado prices. These were offset by elevated prices for beef and paper and packaging items. We expect to be in the low 33% range in Q4, with a slight decrease from Q3 due to the shift in the supply of avocados back to Mexico [indiscernible].\nLabor costs for the quarter were 27.2% or flat compared to Q3 of last year. The price increase offset wage inflation of about 4% to 5%. We also decreased our workers' comp liability by about $4 million in the quarter due to better management of claims activity so far this year. We expect labor costs to increase to the mid-28% range in Q4 as a result of deleverage from seasonally lower sales as well as continued wage pressure.\nOccupancy costs for the quarter were 7.1%, a decrease of 30 basis points compared to Q3 last year, and that's due mostly to the increase in comp sales.\nOther operating costs for the quarter were 13.7%, a decrease of 70 basis points from Q3 of last year.\nOur marketing and promo costs were 2.5% in the quarter, a decrease of about 70 basis points compared to Q3 of last year. The lower-than-expected marketing in Q3 is due to a timing shift into Q4 as our For Real campaign began in late September and will continue through mid-November. As a result, we expect marketing and promo costs will be in the low 4% of sales during Q4, while full year marketing and promo will still be right around 3% of sales overall for the year.\nOther operating costs continue to include about 30 basis points of higher maintenance and repair costs, which we first discussed on the Q4 2017 call, and we expect M&R to continue at this elevated level for the rest of the year before abating in 2019.\nG&A in the quarter increased $24 million compared to Q2 of this year. The increase compared to last quarter was primarily due to $16 million in charges related to the restructuring and other unusual charges in the quarter as well as $11 million for our biennial All Managers' Conference. Compared to Q3 of last year, the items I just listed mostly offset the onetime charge we had in same quarter of last year.\nUnderlying G&A increased compared to last year, primarily in support of our restaurant growth and digitizing our restaurant experience and operational leadership changes in the field. For Q4, we expect total G&A to be right around $95 million, which includes an estimated $10 million to $12 million of restructuring-related expenses. Underlying G&A in Q4, excluding bonuses and stock comp, is expected to be at similar levels as Q2 and Q3 of this year. However, both bonuses and stock comp are expected to be higher year-over-year as a result of better performance.\nDepreciation for the quarter was 4.3%, an increase of 60 basis points from the 3.7% in Q3 of last year. This increase is due to the accelerated depreciation for the restaurant closures we discussed earlier and, to a lesser extent, accelerated depreciation from the office closures.\nWe now expect transformation costs from restructuring and restaurant closures and certain other charges to total between $100 million and $120 million versus our initial estimate of $115 million to $135 million, again, with most hitting into 2018. So far this year, we charged nearly $70 million, and we estimate that another $10 million to $25 million will hit in Q4. And the remaining charges, mostly related to terminating restaurant and office leases, will spill into 2019. We'll continue to provide specific and future transformation-related costs when we have more certainty around timing, and we'll break out the unusual costs from normal costs so you can follow the underlying trend.\nOur pretax income was $58.5 million, and the reported effective tax rate was 36.8%. Our 36.8% reported effective tax rate was higher than our 29.9% underlying rate due to the transformation costs and noncash tax items related to the write-off of deferred tax assets associated with underwater option. While we anticipate the underlying rate in Q4 to remain in the 28.9% to 29.9% range, we anticipate our effective Q4 tax rate to be in the high 30% range or higher due to the impact of transformation charges as well as anticipated additional noncash tax write-off.\nDuring the quarter, we repurchased $19 million of our stock at an average price of $474 per share, leaving about $100 million in our current buyback authorization. Our buyback rate will remain at this lower level as we fund the transformation costs. This decrease is short term, and we expect to return opportunistically repurchasing shares at a higher level once we've completed the restructuring.\nWe're encouraged by our third quarter results as our teams demonstrated that they can stay focused on serving our guests and executing growth drivers while also being nimble on managing the business.  Meanwhile, our support center made important progress in relocating and hiring talent, hosting our All Managers' Conference and rebuilding an organizational structure designed to innovate and deliver on commitments to our guests, to our employees and to our shareholders.\nAnd now we're happy to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question will come from David Tarantino of Baird.\nAnalysts: Just a couple of questions on the comp trends. First, Brian or Jack, could you maybe talk about your estimate of the impact, if there was any, from the Ohio incident that was pretty well publicized? And I guess, based on how you look at the business, looking at maybe your average daily sales trends and seasonally adjusted for that, do you think this most recent uplift from the marketing program has got your back on trend if there was an impact in Q3? And then I have a couple of follow-ups.\nExecutives: Yes, David, this is Jack. There was a lot going on in the quarter. We compared in the middle of the quarter to some soft results from the last year. We had avocado day that turned into a double day once we broke the Internet. We had a back-to-school promotion, and we compared to queso, and then we had marketing at the end. So teasing out any single impact was very difficult. That's why I walked through and I wanted to give the comp trends throughout the quarter. The thing that we know for sure is that marketing did have an impact. As we went on air and as customers started seeing the commercials, we did see an improvement in our sales. And I think when I looked through the net-net of it, by the time we left the quarter, I don't think there's any lasting impact of anything that happened in Ohio.\nAnalysts: Great. That's helpful, Jack. And then on the quarter-to-date, you mentioned 4% for the comp. I know you're cycling now the mix benefits you have with the queso. So I guess is traffic now running positive in the quarter-to-date period behind the advertising?\nExecutives: David, it's right around flattish. When you look at the 4%, we're still carrying a price increase, and about a couple thousand restaurants will lap the next wave in November and then the final wave in January. So I've called the traffic right around flat.\nAnalysts: Great. And then last question for Brian. You talked a lot about the stage-gate process with some of the menu innovation you're working on. So I guess, at a high level, when do you think we'll start seeing some new items added to the menu? And then if you can maybe share your perspective on what you've learned in adding new items to the menu and the operating model.\nExecutives: Sure. So yes, we've got, obviously, a couple items in the stage-gate process on various stages, actually, both digital initiatives as well as food initiatives. And I think you're going to see both a digital, the total system, from loyalty to our mobile app to our digital shelves, all those things are in test markets right now, and we're very optimistic about what we're seeing. And we're continuing to learn. And the plan is they will start to touch, in 2019, consumers. Same thing with a food initiative or 2. So we're still early days, David, but we're learning a lot. We're optimistic about what we're seeing. And we're feeling like the stage-gate process is working, and it's going to set us up to execute with excellence when some of these initiatives come to market in 2019.\nOperator: The next question will come from John Glass of Morgan Stanley.\nAnalysts: Could you -- there were a couple of operational initiatives, Brian, you talked about, either on or off-line, during the quarter, including throughput, seemed like an early opportunity for you. And I think you talked about maybe purchasing -- professionalize in that organization. So some of the operational things that you're taking on, where are you on those? And do they have any impact on the past quarter?\nExecutives: So we are early days into both of those. And the good news is, I would say, our operational focus, I feel like we're out of the starting blocks with getting our throughput to a higher level than where we'd been. But really, our focus was, at our All Managers' Conference, to get everybody aligned on values so that we're hiring the right people, so that ultimately, we can end up with a stable team with the right leaders. And then the other key focus for that meeting was to make sure people understood we're getting back to the throughput excellence, great-tasting food. You do those 2 things, you end up with great customer hospitality. And what I love is I feel like we're out of blocks in all these things, and we should -- as we go into 2019, we'll continue to make progress as opposed to just getting started with it in 2019. And the same thing goes for the supply chain leadership. Carlos, actually, myself and Jack, we've already started our visits with some of our key partners, and it's been great to understand the relationship that was started, in some cases, 25 years ago to some that are relatively new. And the good news is I think this is an iterative process where there's opportunities for Chipotle and our suppliers to benefit going forward. So very optimistic on both of those fronts, and I feel like a lot of good work has been put in place so that when we walk into 2019, we'll start to see some real tangible benefits.\nAnalysts: Just one more for me. On the digital sales growth this quarter, which is impressive, do you -- are you seeing the operational benefits you hoped, particularly some of maybe the margin benefit you hoped utilizing the second make-line? Or is it too early and you have to get sort of a threshold of volume going through that second make-line to really start to see some of the margin leverage benefit that you might expect?\nExecutives: Yes. I think it's a little too early on the margin side of it. But one of the things that's been great to see is where we have the digital make-line, where we have our shelves, and you got this -- obviously, the customer app everywhere, we're seeing increases in customer satisfaction, and we're continuing to see a higher ticket, and it's playing across all those digital channels that you'd expect, the app, the web and in delivery.\nOperator: The next question will come from Nicole Miller of Piper Jaffray.\nAnalysts: It seems to me you've had -- or you're in the midst of a headquarter cultural residing combination with what is store alignment, actually very powerful. So I'm curious, what are today's store-level incentive metrics? And I've noticed on some of my visits some customer contacts in the dining room. And I'm wondering, is that the particular element that you're focusing on?\nExecutives: Yes, absolutely. We are very much focused on -- we want people to walk away from Chipotle with a [indiscernible] guest experience. And I think you heard me mention is when we say the line is the moment of truth, we believe the whole stage is set from the second you see our line. And those are both digital lines as well as our customer-facing line. And I think what Scott and his team have been also focused on is we got to make sure our hospitality matches that client experience. So you will see some table touches. You'll see what Scott calls his 4 cornerstones start to roll out across the system. So I'm delighted to hear that you're seeing that firsthand.\nAnalysts: And could you speak more specifically about the incentive metrics for the store-level employees?\nExecutives: Sure. We can talk a little bit more about that. Scott, I don't know if you want to chime in here, but this is all based on our restaurant AB scorecard. So much [indiscernible].\nExecutives: Scott here. Yes, so our incentives currently are tied to our AB scorecard, which encompasses sales and profits, obviously, but also incorporates the guest experience, food safety, obviously, being paramount to our business. As -- and so when we lathered that up, we understand where we are from a business unit perspective. And everyone is driving to reach the A level. We've had -- we've made great progress this year of getting there. So hopefully, that answers your question around incentives specifically.\nAnalysts: That's very helpful. And then just the last question. Brian, when you first talked to us a couple of conference calls ago, you talked a lot about enhancing and aiding the Chipotle awareness. And today, I heard you talk about customers wanting accessibility. So could you compare and contrast those opportunities? And how are you approaching and prioritizing the strategies and tactics between those 2 opportunities?\nExecutives: Yes. I think you picked up on what I think are the 2 biggest levers outside of our operational excellence, around throughput and great hospitality. I think what you just saw with the For Real marketing campaign -- and this is what I meant by being more visible and also being more focused on what makes Chipotle uniquely different. So you're going to continue to see us push very hard on getting across what makes Chipotle different, what makes Chipotle driving culture, food culture, and then obviously, we want our marketing to be driving the purchase as well. And I think that can be done at the brand level, which is very exciting for Chipotle because I think our purpose is powerful. The other big lever for us is access, and I think it's going to be driven by this digital access. So those are 2 things that we are very focused on getting front and center. And then, obviously, I think there are opportunities for many variety and few other things that we talked about. But the 2 biggest focus areas here in the very near term are the visibility of the Chipotle brand and purpose because I think we're creating a new category with folks and changing food culture. And we're much more visible with the customer's response, and then the digital access aspect is another place where we're seeing great response across that whole digital system that we're rolling out.\nAnalysts: So is it fair maybe for us to think about awareness is really generating the call to action and that access to distribution reducing the friction to get to you? Is that right?\nExecutives: Yes, well said. I should have started there.\nOperator: The next question will come from Sara Senatore of Bernstein.\nAnalysts: I have 2 follow-ups. One, just on traffic. I think in the past, we've heard there's been a bit of a struggle with frequency in the sense of just all tiers of customer maybe coming a little bit less. And I was wondering if you could talk about what you're seeing there. Is this where loyalty comes in? Or is it the new menu items that will bring people back more frequently? So besides access, what are customers telling you that they want to see most in order to sort of ramp up that frequency curve, which used to be such a tailwind to the Chipotle comp? And then I have another one.\nExecutives: Sure. So yes, what we've seen, and this is early days, is with our loyalty pilot, we're seeing people that have less frequency answering the program. And we don't have enough time to truly understand what ultimately is going to be the impact on our frequency, but we're very excited about the cohort that we're seeing come in to the loyalty program in the early days. So we think that is going to play out, where that program will be a vehicle for driving frequency among the cohort, but today, have an opportunity to increase the frequency. Another thing that's really been exciting is a lot of our digital business is attracting new and lapsed users to our business. So that's been another really exciting learning for us. And then I think your point on what about the people that historically were coming all the time, I think that's where we need to get back to talking about what makes Chipotle unique in culture, visible food culture, what makes our purpose so different because that really resonates with our heavy users that are bought in. And we've seen some early indications that, that's a great way to drive frequency into our loyalists.\nAnalysts: That's helpful. And then just on the unit, you were sort of at the low end of the range this year but obviously will be above that in fiscal '19, according to the guidance. I'm just trying to understand the extent to which this year's build rate was maybe a function of just reestablishing your growth pipeline or your development, kind of how you approach it versus just the -- how many attractive trade areas are left. Next year, I guess, would we expect to see more of a mix shift towards some of the newer or less established? Or are you going to continue to mostly focus on these established markets?\nExecutives: I'll answer, and then I'll let Jack chime in as well. But yes, look, what we're really excited about is the restaurants that we opened this year opened very strong. And the economic support continuing to open Chipotle restaurants above the rate of which we opened this year. And I think that was the guidance which I shared with you all. The thing that's also exciting about Chipotle is we're finding we're having success in some new formats. As I've mentioned in the earlier statements, the digital pickup lane is a very exciting proposition. We're going to do more of those next year. We're also very excited about how we're seeing success in proven markets and the new markets that we got the brakes on, frankly, a while ago. But the economic model of new restaurant openings is very powerful, and as such, we are building the pipeline accordingly so that where the opportunities present itself, we can take advantage of those. Jack, I don't know if you want to add anything.\nExecutives: Yes. The only thing, Brian, I would add is, Sara, we did increase the quality this year, and that showed. We've got better economics this year than we have in the past few. We were more discerning. We were more selective. We did focus more of our attention in the proven and fully developed markets. But we also had great success in some of the new and developing. So I think by being discerning, both in our proven markets and our developing and new markets, we've got better quality. I think that sets the table now for us to take the stair step up that we talked about next year. And I fully expect that if we continue to build this kind of quality, work for another stair step the year after. So we focus on quality first, and then quantity, second.\nOperator: The next question will come from Andy Barish of Jefferies.\nAnalysts: Just wondering if you could -- I know you've probably given us a bunch of thoughts coming out of your consumer research. But more importantly, on pricing for next year, any initial conclusions on sort of how you're going to approach pricing versus the historical practice of kind of a larger price increase every several years?\nExecutives: I'll let Jack take that.\nExecutives: Yes, Andy, we have mentioned on previous calls, we're open to a whole different approach. We're in the early stages of talking to some outside parties about our menu compared to competition, customers that shop within our menu and are there opportunities. And I think you'll more likely see us take smaller price increases rather than wait 2 or 3 years or so and then take a larger one, but nothing to report right now.\nAnalysts: Okay. And then just a quick follow-up on -- again, looking out to next year, having For Real for the full year, how do you anticipate sort of the marketing windows to kind of fall versus, obviously, the late roll this year?\nExecutives: Yes. So we are still in the planning phases on exactly when and where we want to use national media. But what we feel really good about is we believe we've got the right communication, and now we're working through how we use the right communication vehicles at the right time. But what we do know is we'll have an always-on social, mobile, digital effort, and then we're still working through how we use the traditional mediums throughout the year in 2019.\nOperator: The next question comes from Sharon Zackfia of William Blair.\nAnalysts: I guess just a follow-up to Andy's question. 3% for marketing, I mean, how are you arriving at that as the right number? And how do we think about that going into 2019?\nExecutives: Yes. So we believe 3% is the right number based on what our planning process is sharing with us. We're using our stage-gate process to really understand what does each initiative provide as far as growth goes, layered on top of our throughput effort. And what we've seen is, as of right now, as we reapproach the marketing budget, we're going to change the allocation from a lot of local marketing to more national. And in that switch, it changes the level of visibility that we can achieve with our marketing dollar. So I think you'll -- what should happen is our 3% should feel like we're much bigger than what our 3% has been historically. And that's our ingoing assumption. Obviously, if we find through our stage-gate process that we have an opportunity to enhance the marketing because the result matches the increased investment, then we'll do that opportunistically. But the going-in plan is to make more out of the 3% than we have in the past.\nAnalysts: Can I ask just a quick follow-up? For 2018, what percent of that marketing budget is digital?\nExecutives: Chris, do you know that off the top of your head?\nExecutives: It's -- so -- I don't know the answer off the top, and I don't know that we necessarily want to give everybody a clue into that. But clearly, with our consumer base going more millennial and more Gen Z, that digital is an integral part of the program for us. And one of the things, we have a lot of things going on with stage gate in terms of 5 initiatives but even the media that we're running. We're constantly in the state of where we look at how it goes and how we evaluate it and to how it moves the business, and we'll feel free to shift things between more traditional linear media and digital media as the results warrant.\nOperator: The next question will come from David Palmer of RBC Capital Markets.\nAnalysts: A couple of follow-ups for me as well. You talked about operations, digital menu innovation, and obviously, you've done a lot of research and testing. But if you were to sort of rank your biggest bucket or buckets of opportunity from this point, how would you do that in terms of what is going to be the biggest source of improvement? I think the assumption might be new menu news being the unlock from here, but I wanted to hear your thoughts.\nExecutives: Yes, look, I don't think new menu news is the primary unlock. I think it plays a role, but I think the digital access, removing fiction and getting into digital access is a big unlock for the Chipotle business. Throughput, reclaiming our throughput capability, is another big unlock. And then, obviously, I think making the brand more visible and more resonant with this For Real campaign is another unlock. So menu will play a role, but I think you're going to find digital and the combination of throughput and reminding people why they love Chipotle are going to be big unlock.\nAnalysts: And, Jack, in the past, you've had these rules of thumbs about margins -- restaurant-level margins and their commensurate level of sales per unit. How has your thinking been changing on that? Obviously, you see innovation deliver your things that bring complexity, and you think that could be margin dilutive. And on the other side, you've talked about productivity, and of course, there's labor inflation and pricing. So how does -- have you really shifted how you think about what margins are possible at what levels of sales?\nExecutives: No, David. We got through and studied this carefully. And I think everything with digital, with delivery, we feel good that there's -- anytime there's an added cost, that there's an opportunity for an efficiency there. So I still think if we get the $2.1 million, we can be in the 21% margin. $2.2 million is at 22% margin. Wage inflation is a bit of a wildcard. We can't overcome that with transaction growth alone. That will require some careful timing and place in the menu price increases. But if we can use well-thought-out menu price increases to make sure that we manage labor inflation, the model is still intact. And there's efficiencies of moving our customers from the front line to the second make-line. And then it's a matter of working with our delivery partners to make sure that the economics work for both us and them. But everything I've said in the past, David, still intact.\nOperator: The next question will come from Karen Holthouse of Goldman Sachs.\nAnalysts: Two quick housekeeping questions, and I have another one. What was the actual cost of the manager conference in the quarter? And what are you working for, for a stock comp for the year?\nExecutives: What was the number for the conference?\nExecutives: It was like $11 -- $10 million in the quarter, $11 million for the year. Stock comp for the year is in the -- between $60 million and $65 million.\nAnalysts: And then as we've started to see some of the marketing digital initiatives take hold, is there anything you're seeing in terms of regional variations in the comp performance? And what I'm really getting at are markets that might be thought of as having more competition in sort of the overall fast-casual space and, specifically, with concepts that share a lot of the same philosophies and values around food quality and sourcing. Are those regions keeping pace with the system?\nExecutives: Yes. We're not seeing big variations in performance based on the initiatives that we've rolled out to date. And when we've done our stage-gate process, we've tried to be true to representing the full United States, so we get a picture of how this performs across the country. So, no, we've not seen that issue.\nOperator: The next question will come from Matt McGinley of Evercore ISI.\nAnalysts: On the labor rate in the quarter, you did a good job of managing that relative to what you had anticipated your totals would be in July. What improved relative to what you assumed back in July?\nExecutives: I missed the first part of your question. Sorry, you cut out.\nAnalysts: The labor rate looked a little bit better than you had guided in July, and I'm curious what came in better than what you anticipated from a labor standpoint?\nExecutives: Yes. Two things. Our teams worked really hard to manage workers' comp, and workers' comp is something that you don't see the benefit week-by-week or month-by-month, but we saw a steady progress throughout the year, and so we're able to make an adjustment there. And then secondly, Scott and the team, they challenged the team during the third quarter to really take a close look at staffing and making sure you got the right people throughout the day. And so we saw some efficiency gains throughout the quarter as well. So those are the 2 things that -- and I agree with you that we did a nicer job with labor in the third quarter than we did in the second quarter.\nAnalysts: In the quarter, you ran a few offers to grow digital usage. I think you ran a BOGO, and you had the free delivery offer. Did that have any impact on the margin? And is promotion something that you would use on a go-forward basis to drive utilization of that? Or would you expect it to be more of just -- a more natural increase in digital usage as awareness of the platform builds?\nExecutives: Let me answer the latter part of the question, and I can hand it back to Jack on your margin question. But, yes, what we have seen is when we increase awareness of the digital platforms, we get a good response. And I think, over time, our loyalty program and using analytics to inform how we incentivize behaviors is going to be the future. You'll see us continue to use what I will call broad-scale incentives as we build the database and get people into our loyalty program, get people using the mobile app. But where we're ultimately headed is we want -- I think we're less than 50% awareness on these digital platforms. We need to improve that dramatically. And then once we get them into the platform, we need to create a capability around using analytics to drive the right incentives for the right cohort at the right time. So with that approach, we think good things happen throughout the entire P&L. But, Jack, I don't know if you want to add anything else.\nExecutives: Yes. I must add I think it was well said. You answered it. It does have a theoretical impact on our margin. We give away guacamole. Guacamole, our customers love it. It comes with more than 50% of our transactions. And we gave away a lot of it that we planned to giving it away for 1 day, we gave it away for 2 days. But not anything that I would call out when you look at $1.2 billion in sales over the entire quarter. It wasn't material enough to look at. But we can invest more making because we attract a lot of people into our digital platform, and so it's an investment that will pay off. So it has a theoretical impact on the margin but not enough to call out during the quarter.\nOperator: The next question will come from Jeffrey Bernstein of Barclays.\nAnalysts: Two questions. One, just following up on the unit growth discussion. I mean, clearly, you're up in the absolute number in '19. I was wondering how you actually arrived at that absolute number. I mean, you talked about how there's lots of opportunities and different types of stores that you could do, and I know a few years back, you were doing well north of 200 stores a year. So I'm wondering how you think about maybe what are the guardrails or challenges to a greater stair step in growth and if you think there's certain market attrition? Or is it real estate availability or close to build or quality of managers? I'm just wondering what keeps you from ramping up that number more meaningfully in the short term?\nExecutives: Look, I think one of the things that always have to go hand-in-hand with new restaurants is having managers ready to take over those new restaurants. So you have to take it at a measured pace as we increase year-to-year because the last thing you want to be doing is opening restaurants ahead of your capability to run them. The good news is I think our economic models suggest we still have room to grow in a meaningful way. And the Chipotle employee value proposition is very compelling, so we're able to attract managers, apprentices to get them prepared and developed so that they can be a part of the growth story as well. So it's really -- it's that balancing act. So you got to have the teams ready to work and leave the restaurant, coupled with making sure you got the right economic sites available to open them. You can't just all of a sudden -- well, you could, but we're not going to just go guardrail to guardrail on this thing. I think we would find ourselves not executing very well. So those are the principles we're using.\nAnalysts: Got it. And then you mentioned the unlocks earlier, which I thought was interesting. You didn't mention anything about, I guess, maybe extended store hours. I know there was some talk of selling burritos earlier in the day, you're going into breakfast store. I know in certain markets you're now doing more late-night initiatives. I'm just wondering how you assess what extended hours might work, what might not work and the potential opportunity.\nExecutives: Yes, I think one of the things we learned through the stage-gate process is hours is going to be a surgical approach. It's not a once initiative. And so in the light of that, we learned that in pilots as opposed on a national level. So you'll see our hours be very surgical. Where it makes sense, you'll see us at different hours, but it's not going to be a national blunt effort.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Brian Niccol for any closing remarks.\nExecutives: Okay. Thanks to everybody for listening and joining in. I think as I've said in my early remarks, very proud of what this team has accomplished in the third quarter. I do believe our strategy to win today and cultivate the future is making tremendous progress. The team that we're building in the support center, I am very excited about diversity of the talent and the caliber of the talent. I'm also very excited about how we've moved all these initiatives forward while moving the company to a new cultural space through this relocation and restructuring. So the Chipotle brand continues to be a purpose-driven brand that we continue to learn over and over again. It means a lot to our customers. It means a lot to our team members and very proud of what we accomplished to date and also very optimistic about the pipeline that we're building and the initiatives that we're focused on going forward. So thank you for taking the time and look forward to speaking with all of you in the future. Take care.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines. Have a great day.\nOperator: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Chipotle Q3 2018 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Coralie Witter. Please go ahead.\nExecutives: Hi, everyone, and welcome to our call today. By now, you should have access to our earnings announcement released this afternoon for the third quarter of 2018. It may also be found on our Investor Relations website at ir.chipotle.com.\nBefore we begin our presentation, I will remind everyone that parts of our discussion today will include forward-looking statements as defined in the securities laws. These forward-looking statements will include statements regarding our outlook for the fourth quarter; the potential of a number of our digital sales strategies; sales trends and forecasts for future comparable sales; expected new restaurant openings; estimates on future food, labor, marketing and maintenance and repair costs and G&A spend; statements about our expected effective tax rate and projections of the amount and timing of transformation and restructuring costs and stock repurchases; as well as other statements of our expectations and plans. These statements are based on information available to us today, and we are not assuming any obligation to update them.\nForward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. We refer you to the risk factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K as updated and our subsequent Form 10-Qs for a discussion of these risks.\nOur discussion today will also include non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations of which can be found on the Presentation page of the Investor Relations section of our website, which can be found at the link included on the Presentation page.\nI'd also like to remind everyone that we have adopted a self-imposed quiet period, restricting communications with investors during that period. The quiet period will begin on the 16th day of the last month of each fiscal quarter and continues until the next earnings conference call. For the fourth quarter of 2018, it will begin December 16 and continue through our fourth quarter earnings release.\nWe will start today's call with some prepared remarks from: Brian Niccol, Chief Executive Officer; and Jack Hartung, Chief Financial Officer, after which we will take questions. Our entire executive leadership team is available during the Q&A period. \nAnd now I will turn the call over to Brian Niccol.\nExecutives: Thanks, Coralie, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report our third quarter results, which demonstrated that our strategy to win today and cultivate a better future are working. Total overall sales grew 8.6% to $1.2 billion, driven by comparable restaurant sales increases of 4.4% and 28 new restaurants opened in the quarter. The positive comp sales trend enabled us to expand restaurant-level margin, which were up 260 basis points year-over-year to 18.7%. Earnings per share adjusted for unusual costs grew 62% to $2.16, and our GAAP earnings were $1.36.\nWhile the quarter experienced some sales headwinds, we had a noticeable lift in sales with the launch of our new For Real marketing campaign in late September. And that increase has sustained through October. Marketing that drives culture, drives difference and drives purchase, combined with great operations, drives results.\nAdditionally in Q3, key growth initiatives moved forward at a healthy pace, and the team executed with excellence the relocation, the restructuring, the hiring of new talent and our All Managers' Conference. We exit the quarter with momentum, which sets us up for a solid fourth quarter, and we remain focused on building a culture of innovation and great execution that will drive sustainable long-term growth.\nBefore I dive deeper into this quarter's bright spots, I'd like to take a step back to remind you that our strategy to win today and cultivate the future is based on 5 focus areas: one, becoming a more culturally relevant and engaging brand that builds love and loyalty; two, digitizing and modernizing our restaurant experience to create a more convenient and enjoyable guest experience; three, running great restaurants with great hospitality and throughput; four, being disciplined and focused to enhance our powerful economic model; and five, building a great culture that can innovate and execute across digital, access, menu and the restaurant experience.\nThis quarter, we've made strides toward becoming a more culturally relevant and engaging brand. Our For Real campaign celebrates what is uniquely Chipotle, that our food reflects our belief that there's a connection between how food is raised and prepared and how it tastes. Real flavors, real ingredients and real cooking techniques result in food that simply tastes better.\nWe are making much better use of our advertising budget by more effectively communicating who we are and by being in better communication channels, thereby increasing our resonance and visibility. We'll continue to be present on national TV through the middle of November, and the For Real messaging will remain visible in digital and social channels for the balance of the year. Going forward, you can expect Chipotle to have a presence in national media where and when it makes sense and to have an always-on social and digital program.\nWhile we are a brand that speaks to everyone, our consumer research tells us that we are particularly relevant to millennials and Gen Z consumers who share our values, and our customers also want to be our employees. During September, we hosted our All Managers' Conference, and it was clear from looking at our general managers and field leaders in the audience that they reflect our customer base. Our teams came away from this conference energized around our purpose, our values and our goals and ready to get back to their restaurants armed with inspiration and information on how to improve the hiring experience, the training experience and the guest experience.\nIn Q3, we made progress on our purpose of cultivating a better world with the announcement of a new accelerated program called the Chipotle Aluminaries Project. This is funded by our Chipotle Cultivate Foundation to help food-focused, growth-stage ventures that share our belief of cultivating a better world and are seeking to disrupt the current food landscape and take their business to the next level.\nWe are using insights from our consumer research to refine our innovation pipeline and how we communicate with our guests. We continue to hear that the #1 reason that consumers eat elsewhere is because they don't have convenient access to Chipotle. Expanding the reach of our digital system remains a key priority in providing our guests with easier access and greater convenience. The digitized second make-lines are now in nearly 750 restaurants and continue to be on track to be in all restaurants by the end of next year. The digital pickup shelves are now in nearly 350 restaurants, and we are moving quickly to get them in all our restaurants before the middle of 2019.\nWe continued to build momentum in digital this quarter, with digital sales growing 48%, accelerating from the year-over-year growth rate we saw in the first half of this year and now accounting for 11.2% of sales. App downloads have increased 25% since last quarter, and we are seeing strong interest from new and infrequent customers, as well as frequent customers.\nAs was the case last quarter, we are seeing particularly strong momentum from delivery. In Q2, we added DoorDash as a new partner, and in Q3, we added delivery capabilities directly from our app and website. A free delivery promotion from our app in September drove an acceleration in delivery sales in the quarter. We continue to see good incrementality in delivery, and we see very little customer overlap between our own in-app delivery and our third-party delivery partner app. We are pleased with how delivery in our app is attracting and retaining new and lapsed customers, and the results we're seeing across our delivery channels validate our strategy to be available wherever and however our guests want to access us.\nAs we continue to remove friction from the digital ordering and pickup process, we would expect our delivery time advantage to continue to widen. Our current average delivery time is under 30 minutes, already making us one of the most attractive choices for customers on our delivery partner's website, and this will keep getting better.\nAs part of our goal to increase access, we are also exploring a new format that leverages digitally-enabled convenience. We're pleased with the early results from our initial digital pickup lane restaurants, and we will expand this test to additional new restaurants in 2019 across several markets. These restaurants have a convenient drive-up window for guests to pick up digital orders. It's clear from these tests that our guests appreciate the added convenience, as these restaurants generate digital sales that are far above our national average. This format is also a win for operations, as the window leverages are digital make-line.\nWe're also excited about our loyalty test, which were launched in September in 3 test markets. It's very early, but sign-ups look promising, and we'll evaluate and learn from the loyalty test as it moves to the stage gate in preparation for national launch during 2019.\nWe also have a number of menu items going through our new stage-gate process so that we can build a pipeline for future years. We're testing quesadillas, nachos, bacon, lemonade and a Mexican chocolate milkshake, for example. These items are in different phases of the stage-gate process.\nImportantly, we're improving our ability to deliver great innovations for our customers and restaurant teams with the new concept of screening process, more consumer insight and a better cross-functional process from idea at the launch.\nLastly, I'd like to touch on where we are in our organizational transformation. At our All Managers' Conference last month, we rolled out our new values. These are: one, the line is the moment of truth; two, teach and taste Chipotle; three, authenticity lives here; and four, the movement is real. These values were very well received at the conference by restaurant managers who are more energized than ever. We also emphasized the following key areas for operations to focus on going forward: number one, throughput excellence; number two, team stability and development; number three, great-tasting food; and number four, great customer hospitality. We did a number of store visits following the conference and asked our restaurant managers what they took away. I'm happy to say we are aligned from the support center to each individual restaurant.\nThese values and focus areas also form the foundation for the culture we are building in our support centers, which exist to serve our general managers and team members so that they can delight our guests. I'm pleased with the significant progress we've made in rebuilding Chipotle into an organization with an inclusive culture that sets us up to be more innovative, more connected to what our guests want and better at executing so that we can capitalize on the tremendous growth opportunities in front of us.\nI'm delighted with the great talent that we are attracting, as well as the talent that we're relocating. We've continued to enhance our leadership team, adding Roger Theodoredis as General Counsel, who joined us from WhiteWave. The restructuring and the relocations are nearing completion, and we are building an organization with best-in-class and diverse talent. I love the start-up energy. It greets me every day I come in.\nFinally, before I turn it over to Jack, I want to thank all of our team members across the company that are providing our guests with a great experience, serving real food cooked to perfection and prepared in our restaurants with fresh ingredients. I'd also like to thank our general managers who collectively do a great job managing the restaurant P&L during quarter 3, enabling Chipotle to deliver on financial commitment.\nOkay, over to you, Jack.\nExecutives: Thanks, Brian. I'm equally pleased with how our team rose to the occasion and didn't miss a beat, despite managing a significant restructuring to deliver a solid quarter and great sales momentum that has carried into the fourth quarter. We generated revenue of $1.2 billion during the quarter, an increase of 8.6% from last year on comp sales growth of 4.4%. Restaurant-level margins of 18.7% expanded 260 basis points from last year, contributing to underlying earnings per share, adjusted for unusual items, up 62% to $2.16. The third quarter had unusual expenses, mostly related to the transformation, and that negatively impacted our tax rate and our earnings per share by about $0.80, leading to GAAP earnings per share of $1.36. As discussed last quarter, we'll continue to see costs over the next few quarters associated with our restructuring, relocation and underperforming store closures.\nIn Q3, we recognized $26 million in total charges, with $10 million related to underperforming or closed restaurants and $16 million related to the organizational restructuring and other unusual expenses. As a result of the transformation as well as noncash tax items, our reported effective tax rate increased to 36.8% or about 690 basis points higher than underlying effective tax rate of 29.9%, which I'll explain later.\nThe Q3 comp of 4.4% was primarily driven by higher average check from the price increase taken last November and January and, to a lesser extent, the addition of queso to our menu. During the quarter, comps were in the mid-single digits during July and August before softening to low single digits in September, when we compared to the advertised launch of queso in 2017. With the launch of our For Real campaign with national TV in late September, comps moved back up and are running 4% so far in October. Looking to Q4, we'll lap the price increase in about 1,000 restaurants in November, which will be a headwind to our overall Q4 comp by about 100 basis points.\nWe would typically provide a first glance of our comp guidance for 2019 right now, but with a growing pipeline of initiatives still early on in the stage-gate process, we'll hold off in providing 2019 comp guidance until we have a better perspective of the timing and expected impact of each of these initiatives.\nWe opened 28 new restaurants in the quarter and continue to expect to be at the lower end of our 130 to 150 new openings guidance for the full year. Our new restaurants this year have opened at stronger levels, and we continue to emphasize high-quality, high returning new restaurants as we build out the pipeline. As a result of these strong unit economics, combined with a healthy pipeline for next year's opening, we expect to open between 140 to 155 new restaurants in 2019.\nAs mentioned on our last call, we expect to close between 55 and 65 underperforming restaurants. In the third quarter, we closed 32 of these restaurants and 38 in total, including the 6 closed in Q2, all related to the restructuring. The remaining underperforming restaurants will close over the next several quarters, as we pursue strategic alternatives to manage our future rent liability.\nFood costs for the quarter were 33.4%, a decrease of 160 basis points from the 35% in Q3 of last year. The decrease from last year was driven by the menu price increase as well as more favorable avocado prices. These were offset by elevated prices for beef and paper and packaging items. We expect to be in the low 33% range in Q4, with a slight decrease from Q3 due to the shift in the supply of avocados back to Mexico, Peru and Chile.\nLabor costs for the quarter were 27.2% or flat compared to Q3 of last year. The price increase offset wage inflation of about 4% to 5%. We also decreased our workers' comp liability by about $4 million in the quarter due to better management of claims activity so far this year. We expect labor costs to increase to the mid-28% range in Q4, as a result of deleverage from seasonally lower sales as well as continued wage pressure.\nOccupancy costs for the quarter were 7.1%, a decrease of 30 basis points compared to Q3 last year, and that's due mostly to the increase in comp sales.\nOther operating costs for the quarter were 13.7%, a decrease of 70 basis points from Q3 of last year.\nOur marketing and promo costs were 2.5% in the quarter, a decrease of about 70 basis points compared to Q3 of last year. The lower-than-expected marketing in Q3 is due to a timing shift into Q4 as our For Real campaign began in late September and will continue through mid-November. As a result, we expect marketing and promo costs will be in the low 4% of sales during Q4, while full year marketing and promo will still be right around 3% of sales overall for the year.\nOther operating costs continue to include about 30 basis points of higher maintenance and repair costs, which we first discussed on the Q4 2017 call, and we expect M&R to continue at this elevated level for the rest of the year before abating in 2019.\nG&A in the quarter increased $24 million compared to Q2 of this year. The increase compared to last quarter was primarily due to $16 million in charges related to the restructuring and other unusual charges in the quarter, as well as $11 million for our biennial All Managers' Conference. Compared to Q3 of last year, the items I just listed mostly offset the one-time charge we had in same quarter of last year.\nUnderlying G&A increased compared to last year, primarily in support of our restaurant growth and digitizing our restaurant experience and operational leadership changes in the field. For Q4, we expect total G&A to be right around $95 million, which includes an estimated $10 million to $12 million of restructuring-related expenses. Underlying G&A in Q4, excluding bonuses and stock comp, is expected to be at similar levels as Q2 and Q3 of this year. However, both bonuses and stock comp are expected to be higher year-over-year as a result of better performance.\nDepreciation for the quarter was 4.3%, an increase of 60 basis points from the 3.7% in Q3 of last year. This increase is due to the accelerated depreciation for the restaurant closures we discussed earlier and, to a lesser extent, accelerated depreciation from the office closures.\nWe now expect transformation costs from restructuring and restaurant closures and certain other charges to total between $100 million and $120 million versus our initial estimate of $115 million to $135 million, again, with most hitting in 2018. So far this year, we charged nearly $70 million, and we estimate that another $10 million to $25 million will hit in Q4. And the remaining charges, mostly related to terminating restaurant and office leases, will spill into 2019. We'll continue to provide specific and future transformation-related costs when we have more certainty around timing, and we'll break out the unusual costs from normal costs so you can follow the underlying trend.\nOur pretax income was $58.5 million, and the reported effective tax rate was 36.8%. Our 36.8% reported effective tax rate was higher than our 29.9% underlying rate due to the transformation costs and noncash tax items related to the write-off of deferred tax assets associated with the underwater option. While we anticipate the underlying rate in Q4 to remain in the 28.9% to 29.9% range, we anticipate our effective Q4 tax rate to be in the high 30% range or higher due to the impact of transformation charges as well as anticipated additional noncash debt write-off.\nDuring the quarter, we repurchased $19 million of our stock at an average price of $474 per share, leaving about $100 million in our current buyback authorization. Our buyback rate will remain at this lower level as we fund the transformation costs. This decrease is short-term, and we expect to return opportunistically repurchasing shares at a higher level once we've completed the restructuring.\nWe're encouraged by our third quarter results, as our teams demonstrated that they can stay focused on serving our guests and executing growth drivers while also being nimble on managing the business. Meanwhile, our support center made important progress in relocating and hiring talent, hosting our All Managers' Conference and rebuilding an organizational structure designed to innovate and deliver on commitments to our guests, to our employees and to our shareholders.\nAnd now we're happy to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question will come from David Tarantino of Baird.\nAnalysts: Just a couple of questions on the comp trends. First, Brian or Jack, could you maybe talk about your estimate of the impact, if there was any, from the Ohio incident that was pretty well-publicized? And I guess, based on how you look at the business, looking at maybe your average daily sales trends and seasonally adjusted for that, do you think this most recent uplift from the marketing program has got your back on trend if there was an impact in Q3? And then I have a couple of follow-ups.\nExecutives: Yes, David, this is Jack. There was a lot going on in the quarter. We compared in the middle of the quarter to some soft results from the last year. We had avocado day that turned into a double day once we broke the Internet. We had a back-to-school promotion that we compared to queso, and then we had marketing at the end. So teasing out any single impact was very difficult. That's why I walked through and I wanted to give the comp trends throughout the quarter. The thing that we know for sure is that marketing did have an impact. As we went on air and as customers started seeing the commercials, we did see an improvement in our sales. And I think when I looked through the net-net of it, by the time we left the quarter, I don't think there's any lasting impact of anything that happened in Ohio.\nAnalysts: Great. That's helpful, Jack. And then on the quarter-to-date, you mentioned up 4% for the comp. I know you're cycling now the mix benefits you have with the queso. So I guess is traffic now running positive in the quarter-to-date period behind the advertising?\nExecutives: David, it's right around flattish. When you look at the 4%, we're still carrying a price increase, and about a couple thousand restaurants will lap the next wave in November and then the final wave in January. So I've called the traffic right around flat.\nAnalysts: Great. And then last question for Brian. You talked a lot about the stage-gate process with some of the menu innovation you're working on. So I guess, at a high level, when do you think we'll start seeing some new items added to the menu? And then if you can maybe share your perspective on what you've learned in adding new items to the menu and the operating model.\nExecutives: Sure. So yes, we've got, obviously, a couple items in the stage-gate process on various stages, actually, both digital initiatives as well as food initiatives. And I think you're going to see both a digital, the total system, from loyalty to our mobile app to our digital shelves, all those things are in test markets right now, and we're very optimistic about what we're seeing. And we're continuing to learn. And the plan is they will start to touch, in 2019, consumers. Same thing with a food initiative or 2. So we're still early days, David, but we're learning a lot. We're optimistic about what we're seeing. And we're feeling like the stage-gate process is working, and it's going to set us up to execute with excellence when some of these initiatives come to market in 2019.\nOperator: The next question will come from John Glass of Morgan Stanley.\nAnalysts: Could you -- there were a couple of operational initiatives, Brian, you talked about, either on or off-line, during the quarter, including throughput, seemed like an early opportunity for you. And I think you talked about maybe purchasing -- professionalize in that organization. So some of the operational things that you're taking on, where are you on those? And do they have any impact on the past quarter?\nExecutives: So we are early days into both of those. And the good news is, I would say, our operational focus, I feel like we're out of the starting blocks with getting our throughput to a higher level than where we've been. But really, our focus was, at our All Managers' Conference, to get everybody aligned on values so that we're hiring the right people, so that ultimately, we can end up with a stable team with the right leaders. And then the other key focus for that meeting was to make sure people understood we're getting back to the throughput excellence, great-tasting food. You do those 2 things, you end up with great customer hospitality. And what I love is I feel like we're out of the blocks on all these things, and we should -- as we go into 2019, we'll continue to make progress as opposed to just getting started with it in 2019. And the same thing goes for the supply chain leadership. Carlos, actually, myself and Jack, we've already started our visits with some of our key partners, and it's been great to understand the relationship that was started, in some cases, 25 years ago to some that are relatively new. And the good news is I think this is an iterative process, where there's opportunities for Chipotle and our suppliers to benefit going forward. So very optimistic on both of those fronts, and I feel like a lot of good work has been put in place so that when we walk into 2019, we'll start to see some real tangible benefits.\nAnalysts: Just one more for me. On the digital sales growth this quarter, which is impressive, do you -- are you seeing the operational benefits you hoped, particularly some of maybe the margin benefit you hoped utilizing the second make-line? Or is it too early and you have to get sort of a threshold of volume going through that second make-line to really start to see some of the margin leverage benefit that you might expect?\nExecutives: Yes. I think it's a little too early on the margin side of it. But one of the things that's been great to see is where we have the digital make-line, where we have our shelves, and you've got this -- obviously, the customer app everywhere, we're seeing increases in customer satisfaction. And we're continuing to see a higher ticket, and it's playing across all those digital channels that you'd expect: the app, the web and in delivery.\nOperator: The next question will come from Nicole Miller of Piper Jaffray.\nAnalysts: It seems to me you've had -- or you're in the midst of a headquarter cultural re-siding combination with what is store alignment, that can be actually very powerful. So I'm curious, what are today's store-level incentive metrics? And I've noticed on some of my visits, some customer contacts in the dining room. And I'm wondering, is that a particular element that you're focusing on?\nExecutives: Yes, absolutely. We are very much focused on -- we want people to walk away from Chipotle with a [ great ] guest experience. And I think you heard me mention this, when we say the line is the moment of truth, we believe the whole stage is set from the second you see our line. And those are both digital lines, as well as our customer-facing line. And I think what Scott and his team have been also focused on is we've got to make sure our hospitality matches that line experience. So you will see some table touches. You'll see what Scott calls his 4 cornerstones start to roll out across the system. So I'm delighted to hear that you're seeing that firsthand.\nAnalysts: And could you speak more specifically about the incentive metrics for the store-level employees?\nExecutives: Sure. We can talk a little bit more about that. Scott, I don't know if you want to chime in here, but this is all based on our restaurant AB scorecard. So much...\nExecutives: Scott here. Yes, so our incentives currently are tied to our AB scorecard, which encompasses sales and profits, obviously, but also incorporates the guest experience, food safety, obviously, being paramount to our business. As -- and so when we lathered that up, we understand where we are from a business unit perspective. And everyone is driving to reach the A level. We've had -- we've made great progress this year of getting there. So I hope that answers your question around incentives specifically.\nAnalysts: That's very helpful. And then just the last question. Brian, when you first talked to us a couple of conference calls ago, you talked a lot about enhancing and aiding the Chipotle awareness. And today, I heard you talk about customers wanting accessibility. So could you compare and contrast those opportunities? And how are you approaching and prioritizing the strategies and tactics between those 2 opportunities?\nExecutives: Yes. I think you picked up on what I think are the 2 biggest levers outside of our operational excellence, around throughput and great hospitality. I think what you just saw with the For Real marketing campaign -- and this is what I meant by being more visible and also being more focused on what makes Chipotle uniquely different. So you're going to continue to see us push very hard on getting across what makes Chipotle different, what makes Chipotle driving culture, food culture, and then obviously, we want our marketing to be driving the purchase as well. And I think that can be done at the brand level, which is very exciting for Chipotle because I think our purpose is powerful. The other big lever for us is access, and I think it's going to be driven by this digital access. So those are 2 things that we are very focused on getting front and center. And then, obviously, I think there are opportunities for menu variety and few other things that we talked about. But the 2 biggest focus areas here in the very near term are the visibility of the Chipotle brand and purpose because I think we're creating a new category with folks and changing food culture. And when we're much more visible with it, customers respond and then, the digital access aspect is another place where we're seeing great response across that whole digital system that we're rolling out.\nAnalysts: So is it fair maybe for us to think about awareness is really generating the call to action and that access [ to distribution is ] reducing the friction to get to you? Is that right?\nExecutives: Yes, well said. I should have started there.\nOperator: The next question will come from Sara Senatore of Bernstein.\nAnalysts: I have 2 follow-ups. One, just on traffic. I think in the past, we've heard there's been a bit of a struggle with frequency in the sense of just all tiers of customers maybe coming a little bit less. And I was wondering if you could talk about what you're seeing there. Is this where loyalty comes in? Or is it the new menu items that will bring people back more frequently? So besides access, what are customers telling you that they want to see most in order to sort of ramp up that frequency curve, which used to be such a tailwind to the Chipotle comp? And then I have another one.\nExecutives: Sure. So yes, what we've seen, and this is early days, is with our loyalty pilot, we're seeing people that have less frequency answering the program. And we don't have enough time to truly understand what ultimately is going to be the impact on our frequency, but we're very excited about the cohort that we're seeing come in to the loyalty program in the early days. So we think that is going to play out, where that program will be a key vehicle for driving frequency among the cohort, but today, I have [ not seen them reduce their ] frequency. Another thing that's really been exciting is a lot of our digital business is attracting new and lapsed users to our business. So that's been another really exciting learning for us. And then I think your point on what about the people that historically were coming all the time, I think that's where we need to get back to talking about what makes Chipotle unique in culture, visible food culture, what makes our purpose so different because that really resonates with our heavy users that are bought in. And we've seen some early indications that, that's a great way to drive frequency into our loyalists.\nAnalysts: That's helpful. And then just on the unit, you were sort of at the low end of the range this year but obviously will be above that in fiscal '19, according to the guidance. I'm just trying to understand the extent to which this year's build rate was maybe a function of just reestablishing your growth pipeline or your development, kind of how you approach it versus just the -- how many attractive trade areas are left. Next year, I guess, would we expect to see more of a mix shift towards some of the newer or less established? Or are you going to continue to mostly focus on these established markets?\nExecutives: I'll answer, and then I'll let Jack chime in as well. But yes, look, what we're really excited about is the restaurants that we opened this year opened very strong. And the economic support continuing to open Chipotle restaurants above the rate of which we opened this year. And I think that was the guidance which I shared with you all. The thing that's also exciting about Chipotle is we're finding we're having success in some new formats. As I've mentioned in the earlier statements, the digital pickup lane is a very exciting proposition. We're going to do more of those next year. We're also very excited about how we're seeing success in proven markets and the new markets that we got the brakes on, frankly, a while ago. But the economic model of new restaurant openings is very powerful, and as such, we are building the pipeline accordingly so that where the opportunities present itself, we can take advantage of those. Jack, I don't know if you want to add anything.\nExecutives: Yes. The only thing, Brian, I would add is, Sara, we did increase the quality this year, and that showed. We've got better economics this year than we have in the past few. We were more discerning. We were more selective. We did focus more of our attention in the proven and fully developed markets. But we also had great success in some of the new and developing. So I think by being discerning, both in our proven markets and our developing and new markets, we've got better quality. I think that sets the table now for us to take the stair step up that we talked about next year. And I fully expect that if we continue to build this kind of quality, work for another stair step the year after. So we focus on quality first, and then quantity, second.\nOperator: The next question will come from Andy Barish of Jefferies.\nAnalysts: Just wondering if you could -- I know you've probably given us a bunch of thoughts coming out of your consumer research. But more importantly, on pricing for next year, any initial conclusions on sort of how you're going to approach pricing versus the historical practice of kind of a larger price increase every several years?\nExecutives: I'll let Jack take that.\nExecutives: Yes, Andy, we have mentioned on previous calls, we're open to a whole different approach. We're in the early stages of talking to some outside parties about our menu compared to competition, customers that shop within our menu and are there opportunities. And I think you'll more likely see us take smaller price increases rather than wait 2 or 3 years or so and then take a larger one, but nothing to report right now.\nAnalysts: Okay. And then just a quick follow-up on -- again, looking out to next year, having For Real for the full year, how do you anticipate sort of the marketing windows to kind of fall versus, obviously, the late roll this year?\nExecutives: Yes. So we are still in the planning phases on exactly when and where we want to use national media. But what we feel really good about is we believe we've got the right communication, and now we're working through how we use the right communication vehicles at the right time. But what we do know is we'll have an always-on social, mobile, digital effort, and then we're still working through how we use the traditional mediums throughout the year in 2019.\nOperator: The next question comes from Sharon Zackfia of William Blair.\nAnalysts: I guess just a follow-up to Andy's question, 3% for marketing, I mean, how are you arriving at that as the right number? And how do we think about that going into 2019?\nExecutives: Yes. So we believe 3% is the right number based on what our planning process is sharing with us. We're using our stage-gate process to really understand what does each initiative provide as far as growth goes, layered on top of our throughput effort. And what we've seen is, as of right now, as we re-approach the marketing budget, we're going to change the allocation from a lot of local marketing to more national. And in that switch, it changes the level of visibility that we can achieve with our marketing dollar. So I think you'll -- what should happen is our 3% should feel like we're much bigger than what our 3% has been historically. And that's our ingoing assumption. Obviously, if we find through our stage-gate process that we have an opportunity to enhance the marketing because the result matches the increased investment, then we'll do that opportunistically. But the going-in plan is to make more out of the 3% than we have in the past.\nAnalysts: Can I ask just a quick follow-up? For 2018, what percent of that marketing budget is digital?\nExecutives: Chris, do you know that off the top of your head?\nExecutives: It's -- so -- I don't know the answer off the top, and I don't know that we necessarily want to give everybody a clue into that. But clearly, with our consumer base going more millennial and more Gen Z, that digital is an integral part of the program for us. And one of the things, we have a lot of things going on with stage gate in terms of 5 initiatives but even the media that we're running, we're constantly in the state of where we look at how it goes and how we evaluate it and to how it moves the business, and we'll feel free to shift things between more traditional linear media and digital media as the results warrant.\nOperator: The next question will come from David Palmer of RBC Capital Markets.\nAnalysts: A couple of follow-ups for me as well. You talked about operations, digital menu innovation, and obviously, you've done a lot of research and testing. But if you were to sort of rank your biggest bucket or buckets of opportunity from this point, how would you do that in terms of what is going to be the biggest source of improvement? I think the assumption might be new menu news being the unlock from here, but I wanted to hear your thoughts.\nExecutives: Yes, look, I don't think new menu news is the primary unlock. I think it plays a role, but I think the digital access, removing friction and getting into digital access is a big unlock for the Chipotle business. Throughput, reclaiming our throughput capability, is another big unlock. And then, obviously, I think making the brand more visible and more resonant with this For Real campaign is another unlock. So menu will play a role, but I think you're going to find digital and the combination of throughput and reminding people why they love Chipotle are going to be the big unlock.\nAnalysts: And, Jack, in the past, you've had these rules of thumbs about margins -- restaurant-level margins and their commensurate level of sales per unit. How has your thinking been changing on that? Obviously, you see innovation in delivery or things that bring complexity, and you think that could be margin dilutive. And on the other side, you've talked about productivity, and of course, there's labor inflation and pricing. So how does -- have you really shifted how you think about what margins are possible at what levels of sales?\nExecutives: No, David. We go through and study this carefully. And I think everything with digital, with delivery, we feel good that there's -- anytime there's an added cost, that there's an opportunity for an efficiency there. So I still think if we get the $2.1 million, we can be in the 21% margin. $2.2 million is at 22% margin. Wage inflation is a bit of a wildcard. We can't overcome that with transaction growth alone. That will require some careful timing and place in the menu price increases. But if we can use well-thought-out menu price increases to make sure that we manage labor inflation, the model is still intact. And there's efficiencies of moving our customers from the front line to the second make-line. And then it's a matter of working with our delivery partners to make sure that the economics work for both us and them. But everything I've said in the past, David, still intact.\nOperator: The next question will come from Karen Holthouse of Goldman Sachs.\nAnalysts: Two quick housekeeping questions, and I have another one. What was the actual cost of the manager conference in the quarter? And what are you working for, for a stock comp for the year?\nExecutives: What was the number for the conference?\nExecutives: It was like $11 -- $10 million in the quarter, $11 million for the year. Stock comp for the year is in the -- between $60 million and $65 million.\nAnalysts: And then as we've started to see some of the marketing digital initiatives take hold, is there anything you're seeing in terms of regional variations in the comp performance? And what I'm really getting at are markets that might be thought of as having more competition in sort of the overall fast-casual space and, specifically, with concepts that share a lot of the same philosophies and values around food quality and sourcing. Are those regions keeping pace with the system?\nExecutives: Yes. We're not seeing big variations in performance based on the initiatives that we've rolled out to date. And when we've done our stage-gate process, we've tried to be true to representing the full United States, so we get a picture of how this performs across the country. So, no, we've not seen that issue.\nOperator: The next question will come from Matt McGinley of Evercore ISI.\nAnalysts: On the labor rate in the quarter, you did a good job of managing that relative to what you had anticipated your totals would be in July. What improved relative to what you assumed back in July?\nExecutives: I missed the first part of your question. Sorry, you cut out.\nAnalysts: The labor rate looked a little bit better than you had guided in July, and I'm curious what came in better than what you anticipated from a labor standpoint?\nExecutives: Yes. Two things. Our teams worked really hard to manage workers' comp, and workers' comp is something that you don't see the benefit week-by-week or month-by-month, but we saw a steady progress throughout the year, and so we're able to make an adjustment there. And then secondly, Scott and the team, they challenged the team during the third quarter to really take a close look at staffing and making sure you've got the right people throughout the day. And so we saw some efficiency gains throughout the quarter as well. So those are the 2 things that -- and I agree with you that we did a nicer job with labor in the third quarter than we did in the second quarter.\nAnalysts: In the quarter, you ran a few offers to grow digital usage. I think you ran a BOGO, and you had the free delivery offer. Did that have any impact on the margin? And is promotion something that you would use on a go-forward basis to drive utilization of that? Or would you expect it to be more of just -- a more natural increase in digital usage as awareness of the platform builds?\nExecutives: Let me answer the latter part of the question, and I can hand it back to Jack on your margin question. But, yes, what we have seen is when we increase awareness of the digital platforms, we get a good response. And I think, over time, our loyalty program and using analytics to inform how we incentivize behaviors is going to be the future. You'll see us continue to use what I will call broad-scale incentives as we build the database and get people into our loyalty program, get people using the mobile app. But where we're ultimately headed is we want -- I think we're less than 50% awareness on these digital platforms. We need to improve that dramatically. And then once we get them into the platform, we need to create a capability around using analytics to drive the right incentives for the right cohort at the right time. So with that approach, we think good things happen throughout the entire P&L. But, Jack, I don't know if you want to add anything else.\nExecutives: Yes. I must add I think it was well said. You answered it. It does have a theoretical impact on our margin. We give away guacamole. Guacamole, our customers love it. It comes with more than 50% of our transactions. And we gave away a lot of it that we planned to giving it away for 1 day, we gave it away for 2 days. But not anything that I would call out when you look at $1.2 billion in sales over the entire quarter. It wasn't material enough to look at. But it's an investment worth making because we attract a lot of people into our digital platform, and so it's an investment that will pay off. So it has a theoretical impact on the margin but not enough to call out during the quarter.\nOperator: The next question will come from Jeffrey Bernstein of Barclays.\nAnalysts: Two questions. One, just following up on the unit growth discussion. I mean, clearly, you're up in the absolute number in '19. I was wondering how you actually arrived at that absolute number. I mean, you talked about how there's lots of opportunities and different types of stores that you could do, and I know a few years back, you were doing well north of 200 stores a year. So I'm wondering how you think about maybe what are the guardrails or challenges to a greater stair step in growth? I don't know if you think there are certain markets that are at saturation? Or is it real estate availability or cost to build or quality of managers? I'm just wondering what keeps you from ramping up that number more meaningfully in the short term?\nExecutives: Look, I think one of the things that always has to go hand-in-hand with new restaurants is having managers ready to take over those new restaurants. So you have to take it at a measured pace, as we increase year-to-year because the last thing you want to be doing is opening restaurants ahead of your capability to run them. The good news is I think our economic models suggest we still have room to grow in a meaningful way. And the Chipotle employee value proposition is very compelling, so we're able to attract managers, apprentices to get them prepared and developed so that they can be a part of the growth story as well. So it's really -- it's that balancing act of you've got to have the teams ready to work and lead the restaurant, coupled with making sure you've got the right economic sites available to open them. You can't just all of a sudden -- well, you could, but we're not going to just go guardrail to guardrail on this thing. I think we would find ourselves not executing very well. So those are the principles we're using.\nAnalysts: Got it. And then you mentioned the unlocks earlier, which I thought was interesting. You didn't mention anything about, I guess, maybe extended store hours. I know there was some talk of selling burritos earlier in the day or going into breakfast or I know in certain markets you're now doing more late-night initiatives. I'm just wondering how you assess what extended hours might work, what might not work and the potential opportunity.\nExecutives: Yes, I think one of the things we learned through the stage-gate process is hours is going to be a surgical approach. It's not a once initiative. And so in the light of that, we learned that in pilots as opposed to on a national level. So you'll see our hours be very surgical. Where it makes sense, you'll see us at different hours, but it's not going to be a national blunt effort.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Brian Niccol for any closing remarks.\nExecutives: Okay. Thanks to everybody for listening and joining in. I think as I've said in my early remarks, very proud of what this team has accomplished in the third quarter. I do believe our strategy to win today and cultivate the future is making tremendous progress. The team that we're building in the support center, I am very excited about diversity of the talent and the caliber of the talent. I'm also very excited about how we've moved all these initiatives forward while moving the company to a new cultural space through this relocation and restructuring. So the Chipotle brand continues to be a purpose-driven brand that we continue to learn over and over again, it means a lot to our customers. It means a lot to our team members and very proud of what we accomplished to date and also very optimistic about the pipeline that we're building and the initiatives that we're focused on going forward. So thank you for taking the time and look forward to speaking with all of you in the future. Take care.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines. Have a great day.\nOperator: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Chipotle Q3 2018 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Coralie Witter. Please go ahead.\nExecutives: Hi, everyone, and welcome to our call today. By now, you should have access to our earnings announcement released this afternoon for the third quarter of 2018. It may also be found on our Investor Relations website at ir.chipotle.com.\nBefore we begin our presentation, I will remind everyone that parts of our discussion today will include forward-looking statements as defined in the securities laws. These forward-looking statements will include statements regarding our outlook for the fourth quarter; the potential of a number of our digital sales strategies; sales trends and forecasts for future comparable sales; expected new restaurant openings; estimates on future food, labor, marketing and maintenance and repair costs and G&A spend; statements about our expected effective tax rate and projections of the amount and timing of transformation and restructuring costs and stock repurchases; as well as other statements of our expectations and plans. These statements are based on information available to us today, and we are not assuming any obligation to update them.\nForward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. We refer you to the risk factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K as updated and our subsequent Form 10-Qs for a discussion of these risks.\nOur discussion today will also include non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations of which can be found on the Presentation page of the Investor Relations section of our website, which can be found at the link included on the Presentation page.\nI'd also like to remind everyone that we have adopted a self-imposed quiet period, restricting communications with investors during that period. The quiet period will begin on the 16th day of the last month of each fiscal quarter and continues until the next earnings conference call. For the fourth quarter of 2018, it will begin December 16 and continue through our fourth quarter earnings release.\nWe will start today's call with some prepared remarks from: Brian Niccol, Chief Executive Officer; and Jack Hartung, Chief Financial Officer, after which we will take questions. Our entire executive leadership team is available during the Q&A period. \nAnd now I will turn the call over to Brian Niccol.\nExecutives: Thanks, Coralie, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report our third quarter results, which demonstrated that our strategy to win today and cultivate a better future are working. Total overall sales grew 8.6% to $1.2 billion, driven by comparable restaurant sales increases of 4.4% and 28 new restaurants opened in the quarter. The positive comp sales trend enabled us to expand restaurant-level margin, which were up 260 basis points year-over-year to 18.7%. Earnings per share adjusted for unusual costs grew 62% to $2.16, and our GAAP earnings were $1.36.\nWhile the quarter experienced some sales headwinds, we had a noticeable lift in sales with the launch of our new For Real marketing campaign in late September. And that increase has sustained through October. Marketing that drives culture, drives difference and drives purchase, combined with great operations, drives results.\nAdditionally in Q3, key growth initiatives moved forward at a healthy pace, and the team executed with excellence the relocation, the restructuring, the hiring of new talent and our All Managers' Conference. We exit the quarter with momentum, which sets us up for a solid fourth quarter, and we remain focused on building a culture of innovation and great execution that will drive sustainable long-term growth.\nBefore I dive deeper into this quarter's bright spots, I'd like to take a step back to remind you that our strategy to win today and cultivate the future is based on 5 focus areas: one, becoming a more culturally relevant and engaging brand that builds love and loyalty; two, digitizing and modernizing our restaurant experience to create a more convenient and enjoyable guest experience; three, running great restaurants with great hospitality and throughput; four, being disciplined and focused to enhance our powerful economic model; and five, building a great culture that can innovate and execute across digital, access, menu and the restaurant experience.\nThis quarter, we've made strides toward becoming a more culturally relevant and engaging brand. Our For Real campaign celebrates what is uniquely Chipotle, that our food reflects our belief that there's a connection between how food is raised and prepared and how it tastes. Real flavors, real ingredients and real cooking techniques result in food that simply tastes better.\nWe are making much better use of our advertising budget by more effectively communicating who we are and by being in better communication channels, thereby increasing our resonance and visibility. We'll continue to be present on national TV through the middle of November, and the For Real messaging will remain visible in digital and social channels for the balance of the year. Going forward, you can expect Chipotle to have a presence in national media where and when it makes sense and to have an always-on social and digital program.\nWhile we are a brand that speaks to everyone, our consumer research tells us that we are particularly relevant to millennials and Gen Z consumers who share our values, and our customers also want to be our employees. During September, we hosted our All Managers' Conference, and it was clear from looking at our general managers and field leaders in the audience that they reflect our customer base. Our teams came away from this conference energized around our purpose, our values and our goals and ready to get back to their restaurants armed with inspiration and information on how to improve the hiring experience, the training experience and the guest experience.\nIn Q3, we made progress on our purpose of cultivating a better world with the announcement of a new accelerated program called the Chipotle Aluminaries Project. This is funded by our Chipotle Cultivate Foundation to help food-focused, growth-stage ventures that share our belief of cultivating a better world and are seeking to disrupt the current food landscape and take their business to the next level.\nWe are using insights from our consumer research to refine our innovation pipeline and how we communicate with our guests. We continue to hear that the #1 reason that consumers eat elsewhere is because they don't have convenient access to Chipotle. Expanding the reach of our digital system remains a key priority in providing our guests with easier access and greater convenience. The digitized second make-lines are now in nearly 750 restaurants and continue to be on track to be in all restaurants by the end of next year. The digital pickup shelves are now in nearly 350 restaurants, and we are moving quickly to get them in all our restaurants before the middle of 2019.\nWe continued to build momentum in digital this quarter, with digital sales growing 48%, accelerating from the year-over-year growth rate we saw in the first half of this year and now accounting for 11.2% of sales. App downloads have increased 25% since last quarter, and we are seeing strong interest from new and infrequent customers, as well as frequent customers.\nAs was the case last quarter, we are seeing particularly strong momentum from delivery. In Q2, we added DoorDash as a new partner, and in Q3, we added delivery capabilities directly from our app and website. A free delivery promotion from our app in September drove an acceleration in delivery sales in the quarter. We continue to see good incrementality in delivery, and we see very little customer overlap between our own in-app delivery and our third-party delivery partner app. We are pleased with how delivery in our app is attracting and retaining new and lapsed customers, and the results we're seeing across our delivery channels validate our strategy to be available wherever and however our guests want to access us.\nAs we continue to remove friction from the digital ordering and pickup process, we would expect our delivery time advantage to continue to widen. Our current average delivery time is under 30 minutes, already making us one of the most attractive choices for customers on our delivery partner's website, and this will keep getting better.\nAs part of our goal to increase access, we are also exploring a new format that leverages digitally-enabled convenience. We're pleased with the early results from our initial digital pickup lane restaurants, and we will expand this test to additional new restaurants in 2019 across several markets. These restaurants have a convenient drive-up window for guests to pick up digital orders. It's clear from these tests that our guests appreciate the added convenience, as these restaurants generate digital sales that are far above our national average. This format is also a win for operations, as the window leverages are digital make-line.\nWe're also excited about our loyalty test, which were launched in September in 3 test markets. It's very early, but sign-ups look promising, and we'll evaluate and learn from the loyalty test as it moves to the stage gate in preparation for national launch during 2019.\nWe also have a number of menu items going through our new stage-gate process so that we can build a pipeline for future years. We're testing quesadillas, nachos, bacon, lemonade and a Mexican chocolate milkshake, for example. These items are in different phases of the stage-gate process.\nImportantly, we're improving our ability to deliver great innovations for our customers and restaurant teams with the new concept of screening process, more consumer insight and a better cross-functional process from idea at the launch.\nLastly, I'd like to touch on where we are in our organizational transformation. At our All Managers' Conference last month, we rolled out our new values. These are: one, the line is the moment of truth; two, teach and taste Chipotle; three, authenticity lives here; and four, the movement is real. These values were very well received at the conference by restaurant managers who are more energized than ever. We also emphasized the following key areas for operations to focus on going forward: number one, throughput excellence; number two, team stability and development; number three, great-tasting food; and number four, great customer hospitality. We did a number of store visits following the conference and asked our restaurant managers what they took away. I'm happy to say we are aligned from the support center to each individual restaurant.\nThese values and focus areas also form the foundation for the culture we are building in our support centers, which exist to serve our general managers and team members so that they can delight our guests. I'm pleased with the significant progress we've made in rebuilding Chipotle into an organization with an inclusive culture that sets us up to be more innovative, more connected to what our guests want and better at executing so that we can capitalize on the tremendous growth opportunities in front of us.\nI'm delighted with the great talent that we are attracting, as well as the talent that we're relocating. We've continued to enhance our leadership team, adding Roger Theodoredis as General Counsel, who joined us from WhiteWave. The restructuring and the relocations are nearing completion, and we are building an organization with best-in-class and diverse talent. I love the start-up energy. It greets me every day I come in.\nFinally, before I turn it over to Jack, I want to thank all of our team members across the company that are providing our guests with a great experience, serving real food cooked to perfection and prepared in our restaurants with fresh ingredients. I'd also like to thank our general managers who collectively do a great job managing the restaurant P&L during quarter 3, enabling Chipotle to deliver on financial commitment.\nOkay, over to you, Jack.\nExecutives: Thanks, Brian. I'm equally pleased with how our team rose to the occasion and didn't miss a beat, despite managing a significant restructuring to deliver a solid quarter and great sales momentum that has carried into the fourth quarter. We generated revenue of $1.2 billion during the quarter, an increase of 8.6% from last year on comp sales growth of 4.4%. Restaurant-level margins of 18.7% expanded 260 basis points from last year, contributing to underlying earnings per share, adjusted for unusual items, up 62% to $2.16. The third quarter had unusual expenses, mostly related to the transformation, and that negatively impacted our tax rate and our earnings per share by about $0.80, leading to GAAP earnings per share of $1.36. As discussed last quarter, we'll continue to see costs over the next few quarters associated with our restructuring, relocation and underperforming store closures.\nIn Q3, we recognized $26 million in total charges, with $10 million related to underperforming or closed restaurants and $16 million related to the organizational restructuring and other unusual expenses. As a result of the transformation as well as noncash tax items, our reported effective tax rate increased to 36.8% or about 690 basis points higher than underlying effective tax rate of 29.9%, which I'll explain later.\nThe Q3 comp of 4.4% was primarily driven by higher average check from the price increase taken last November and January and, to a lesser extent, the addition of queso to our menu. During the quarter, comps were in the mid-single digits during July and August before softening to low single digits in September, when we compared to the advertised launch of queso in 2017. With the launch of our For Real campaign with national TV in late September, comps moved back up and are running 4% so far in October. Looking to Q4, we'll lap the price increase in about 1,000 restaurants in November, which will be a headwind to our overall Q4 comp by about 100 basis points.\nWe would typically provide a first glance of our comp guidance for 2019 right now, but with a growing pipeline of initiatives still early on in the stage-gate process, we'll hold off in providing 2019 comp guidance until we have a better perspective of the timing and expected impact of each of these initiatives.\nWe opened 28 new restaurants in the quarter and continue to expect to be at the lower end of our 130 to 150 new openings guidance for the full year. Our new restaurants this year have opened at stronger levels, and we continue to emphasize high-quality, high returning new restaurants as we build out the pipeline. As a result of these strong unit economics, combined with a healthy pipeline for next year's opening, we expect to open between 140 to 155 new restaurants in 2019.\nAs mentioned on our last call, we expect to close between 55 and 65 underperforming restaurants. In the third quarter, we closed 32 of these restaurants and 38 in total, including the 6 closed in Q2, all related to the restructuring. The remaining underperforming restaurants will close over the next several quarters, as we pursue strategic alternatives to manage our future rent liability.\nFood costs for the quarter were 33.4%, a decrease of 160 basis points from the 35% in Q3 of last year. The decrease from last year was driven by the menu price increase as well as more favorable avocado prices. These were offset by elevated prices for beef and paper and packaging items. We expect to be in the low 33% range in Q4, with a slight decrease from Q3 due to the shift in the supply of avocados back to Mexico, Peru and Chile.\nLabor costs for the quarter were 27.2% or flat compared to Q3 of last year. The price increase offset wage inflation of about 4% to 5%. We also decreased our workers' comp liability by about $4 million in the quarter due to better management of claims activity so far this year. We expect labor costs to increase to the mid-28% range in Q4, as a result of deleverage from seasonally lower sales as well as continued wage pressure.\nOccupancy costs for the quarter were 7.1%, a decrease of 30 basis points compared to Q3 last year, and that's due mostly to the increase in comp sales.\nOther operating costs for the quarter were 13.7%, a decrease of 70 basis points from Q3 of last year.\nOur marketing and promo costs were 2.5% in the quarter, a decrease of about 70 basis points compared to Q3 of last year. The lower-than-expected marketing in Q3 is due to a timing shift into Q4 as our For Real campaign began in late September and will continue through mid-November. As a result, we expect marketing and promo costs will be in the low 4% of sales during Q4, while full year marketing and promo will still be right around 3% of sales overall for the year.\nOther operating costs continue to include about 30 basis points of higher maintenance and repair costs, which we first discussed on the Q4 2017 call, and we expect M&R to continue at this elevated level for the rest of the year before abating in 2019.\nG&A in the quarter increased $24 million compared to Q2 of this year. The increase compared to last quarter was primarily due to $16 million in charges related to the restructuring and other unusual charges in the quarter, as well as $11 million for our biennial All Managers' Conference. Compared to Q3 of last year, the items I just listed mostly offset the one-time charge we had in same quarter of last year.\nUnderlying G&A increased compared to last year, primarily in support of our restaurant growth and digitizing our restaurant experience and operational leadership changes in the field. For Q4, we expect total G&A to be right around $95 million, which includes an estimated $10 million to $12 million of restructuring-related expenses. Underlying G&A in Q4, excluding bonuses and stock comp, is expected to be at similar levels as Q2 and Q3 of this year. However, both bonuses and stock comp are expected to be higher year-over-year as a result of better performance.\nDepreciation for the quarter was 4.3%, an increase of 60 basis points from the 3.7% in Q3 of last year. This increase is due to the accelerated depreciation for the restaurant closures we discussed earlier and, to a lesser extent, accelerated depreciation from the office closures.\nWe now expect transformation costs from restructuring and restaurant closures and certain other charges to total between $100 million and $120 million versus our initial estimate of $115 million to $135 million, again, with most hitting in 2018. So far this year, we charged nearly $70 million, and we estimate that another $10 million to $25 million will hit in Q4. And the remaining charges, mostly related to terminating restaurant and office leases, will spill into 2019. We'll continue to provide specific and future transformation-related costs when we have more certainty around timing, and we'll break out the unusual costs from normal costs so you can follow the underlying trend.\nOur pretax income was $58.5 million, and the reported effective tax rate was 36.8%. Our 36.8% reported effective tax rate was higher than our 29.9% underlying rate due to the transformation costs and noncash tax items related to the write-off of deferred tax assets associated with the underwater option. While we anticipate the underlying rate in Q4 to remain in the 28.9% to 29.9% range, we anticipate our effective Q4 tax rate to be in the high 30% range or higher due to the impact of transformation charges as well as anticipated additional noncash debt write-off.\nDuring the quarter, we repurchased $19 million of our stock at an average price of $474 per share, leaving about $100 million in our current buyback authorization. Our buyback rate will remain at this lower level as we fund the transformation costs. This decrease is short-term, and we expect to return opportunistically repurchasing shares at a higher level once we've completed the restructuring.\nWe're encouraged by our third quarter results, as our teams demonstrated that they can stay focused on serving our guests and executing growth drivers while also being nimble on managing the business. Meanwhile, our support center made important progress in relocating and hiring talent, hosting our All Managers' Conference and rebuilding an organizational structure designed to innovate and deliver on commitments to our guests, to our employees and to our shareholders.\nAnd now we're happy to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question will come from David Tarantino of Baird.\nAnalysts: Just a couple of questions on the comp trends. First, Brian or Jack, could you maybe talk about your estimate of the impact, if there was any, from the Ohio incident that was pretty well-publicized? And I guess, based on how you look at the business, looking at maybe your average daily sales trends and seasonally adjusted for that, do you think this most recent uplift from the marketing program has got your back on trend if there was an impact in Q3? And then I have a couple of follow-ups.\nExecutives: Yes, David, this is Jack. There was a lot going on in the quarter. We compared in the middle of the quarter to some soft results from the last year. We had avocado day that turned into a double day once we broke the Internet. We had a back-to-school promotion that we compared to queso, and then we had marketing at the end. So teasing out any single impact was very difficult. That's why I walked through and I wanted to give the comp trends throughout the quarter. The thing that we know for sure is that marketing did have an impact. As we went on air and as customers started seeing the commercials, we did see an improvement in our sales. And I think when I looked through the net-net of it, by the time we left the quarter, I don't think there's any lasting impact of anything that happened in Ohio.\nAnalysts: Great. That's helpful, Jack. And then on the quarter-to-date, you mentioned up 4% for the comp. I know you're cycling now the mix benefits you have with the queso. So I guess is traffic now running positive in the quarter-to-date period behind the advertising?\nExecutives: David, it's right around flattish. When you look at the 4%, we're still carrying a price increase, and about a couple thousand restaurants will lap the next wave in November and then the final wave in January. So I've called the traffic right around flat.\nAnalysts: Great. And then last question for Brian. You talked a lot about the stage-gate process with some of the menu innovation you're working on. So I guess, at a high level, when do you think we'll start seeing some new items added to the menu? And then if you can maybe share your perspective on what you've learned in adding new items to the menu and the operating model.\nExecutives: Sure. So yes, we've got, obviously, a couple items in the stage-gate process on various stages, actually, both digital initiatives as well as food initiatives. And I think you're going to see both a digital, the total system, from loyalty to our mobile app to our digital shelves, all those things are in test markets right now, and we're very optimistic about what we're seeing. And we're continuing to learn. And the plan is they will start to touch, in 2019, consumers. Same thing with a food initiative or 2. So we're still early days, David, but we're learning a lot. We're optimistic about what we're seeing. And we're feeling like the stage-gate process is working, and it's going to set us up to execute with excellence when some of these initiatives come to market in 2019.\nOperator: The next question will come from John Glass of Morgan Stanley.\nAnalysts: Could you -- there were a couple of operational initiatives, Brian, you talked about, either on or off-line, during the quarter, including throughput, seemed like an early opportunity for you. And I think you talked about maybe purchasing -- professionalize in that organization. So some of the operational things that you're taking on, where are you on those? And do they have any impact on the past quarter?\nExecutives: So we are early days into both of those. And the good news is, I would say, our operational focus, I feel like we're out of the starting blocks with getting our throughput to a higher level than where we've been. But really, our focus was, at our All Managers' Conference, to get everybody aligned on values so that we're hiring the right people, so that ultimately, we can end up with a stable team with the right leaders. And then the other key focus for that meeting was to make sure people understood we're getting back to the throughput excellence, great-tasting food. You do those 2 things, you end up with great customer hospitality. And what I love is I feel like we're out of the blocks on all these things, and we should -- as we go into 2019, we'll continue to make progress as opposed to just getting started with it in 2019. And the same thing goes for the supply chain leadership. Carlos, actually, myself and Jack, we've already started our visits with some of our key partners, and it's been great to understand the relationship that was started, in some cases, 25 years ago to some that are relatively new. And the good news is I think this is an iterative process, where there's opportunities for Chipotle and our suppliers to benefit going forward. So very optimistic on both of those fronts, and I feel like a lot of good work has been put in place so that when we walk into 2019, we'll start to see some real tangible benefits.\nAnalysts: Just one more for me. On the digital sales growth this quarter, which is impressive, do you -- are you seeing the operational benefits you hoped, particularly some of maybe the margin benefit you hoped utilizing the second make-line? Or is it too early and you have to get sort of a threshold of volume going through that second make-line to really start to see some of the margin leverage benefit that you might expect?\nExecutives: Yes. I think it's a little too early on the margin side of it. But one of the things that's been great to see is where we have the digital make-line, where we have our shelves, and you've got this -- obviously, the customer app everywhere, we're seeing increases in customer satisfaction. And we're continuing to see a higher ticket, and it's playing across all those digital channels that you'd expect: the app, the web and in delivery.\nOperator: The next question will come from Nicole Miller of Piper Jaffray.\nAnalysts: It seems to me you've had -- or you're in the midst of a headquarter cultural re-siding combination with what is store alignment, that can be actually very powerful. So I'm curious, what are today's store-level incentive metrics? And I've noticed on some of my visits, some customer contacts in the dining room. And I'm wondering, is that a particular element that you're focusing on?\nExecutives: Yes, absolutely. We are very much focused on -- we want people to walk away from Chipotle with a [ great ] guest experience. And I think you heard me mention this, when we say the line is the moment of truth, we believe the whole stage is set from the second you see our line. And those are both digital lines, as well as our customer-facing line. And I think what Scott and his team have been also focused on is we've got to make sure our hospitality matches that line experience. So you will see some table touches. You'll see what Scott calls his 4 cornerstones start to roll out across the system. So I'm delighted to hear that you're seeing that firsthand.\nAnalysts: And could you speak more specifically about the incentive metrics for the store-level employees?\nExecutives: Sure. We can talk a little bit more about that. Scott, I don't know if you want to chime in here, but this is all based on our restaurant AB scorecard. So much...\nExecutives: Scott here. Yes, so our incentives currently are tied to our AB scorecard, which encompasses sales and profits, obviously, but also incorporates the guest experience, food safety, obviously, being paramount to our business. As -- and so when we lathered that up, we understand where we are from a business unit perspective. And everyone is driving to reach the A level. We've had -- we've made great progress this year of getting there. So I hope that answers your question around incentives specifically.\nAnalysts: That's very helpful. And then just the last question. Brian, when you first talked to us a couple of conference calls ago, you talked a lot about enhancing and aiding the Chipotle awareness. And today, I heard you talk about customers wanting accessibility. So could you compare and contrast those opportunities? And how are you approaching and prioritizing the strategies and tactics between those 2 opportunities?\nExecutives: Yes. I think you picked up on what I think are the 2 biggest levers outside of our operational excellence, around throughput and great hospitality. I think what you just saw with the For Real marketing campaign -- and this is what I meant by being more visible and also being more focused on what makes Chipotle uniquely different. So you're going to continue to see us push very hard on getting across what makes Chipotle different, what makes Chipotle driving culture, food culture, and then obviously, we want our marketing to be driving the purchase as well. And I think that can be done at the brand level, which is very exciting for Chipotle because I think our purpose is powerful. The other big lever for us is access, and I think it's going to be driven by this digital access. So those are 2 things that we are very focused on getting front and center. And then, obviously, I think there are opportunities for menu variety and few other things that we talked about. But the 2 biggest focus areas here in the very near term are the visibility of the Chipotle brand and purpose because I think we're creating a new category with folks and changing food culture. And when we're much more visible with it, customers respond and then, the digital access aspect is another place where we're seeing great response across that whole digital system that we're rolling out.\nAnalysts: So is it fair maybe for us to think about awareness is really generating the call to action and that access [ to distribution is ] reducing the friction to get to you? Is that right?\nExecutives: Yes, well said. I should have started there.\nOperator: The next question will come from Sara Senatore of Bernstein.\nAnalysts: I have 2 follow-ups. One, just on traffic. I think in the past, we've heard there's been a bit of a struggle with frequency in the sense of just all tiers of customers maybe coming a little bit less. And I was wondering if you could talk about what you're seeing there. Is this where loyalty comes in? Or is it the new menu items that will bring people back more frequently? So besides access, what are customers telling you that they want to see most in order to sort of ramp up that frequency curve, which used to be such a tailwind to the Chipotle comp? And then I have another one.\nExecutives: Sure. So yes, what we've seen, and this is early days, is with our loyalty pilot, we're seeing people that have less frequency answering the program. And we don't have enough time to truly understand what ultimately is going to be the impact on our frequency, but we're very excited about the cohort that we're seeing come in to the loyalty program in the early days. So we think that is going to play out, where that program will be a key vehicle for driving frequency among the cohort, but today, I have [ not seen them reduce their ] frequency. Another thing that's really been exciting is a lot of our digital business is attracting new and lapsed users to our business. So that's been another really exciting learning for us. And then I think your point on what about the people that historically were coming all the time, I think that's where we need to get back to talking about what makes Chipotle unique in culture, visible food culture, what makes our purpose so different because that really resonates with our heavy users that are bought in. And we've seen some early indications that, that's a great way to drive frequency into our loyalists.\nAnalysts: That's helpful. And then just on the unit, you were sort of at the low end of the range this year but obviously will be above that in fiscal '19, according to the guidance. I'm just trying to understand the extent to which this year's build rate was maybe a function of just reestablishing your growth pipeline or your development, kind of how you approach it versus just the -- how many attractive trade areas are left. Next year, I guess, would we expect to see more of a mix shift towards some of the newer or less established? Or are you going to continue to mostly focus on these established markets?\nExecutives: I'll answer, and then I'll let Jack chime in as well. But yes, look, what we're really excited about is the restaurants that we opened this year opened very strong. And the economic support continuing to open Chipotle restaurants above the rate of which we opened this year. And I think that was the guidance which I shared with you all. The thing that's also exciting about Chipotle is we're finding we're having success in some new formats. As I've mentioned in the earlier statements, the digital pickup lane is a very exciting proposition. We're going to do more of those next year. We're also very excited about how we're seeing success in proven markets and the new markets that we got the brakes on, frankly, a while ago. But the economic model of new restaurant openings is very powerful, and as such, we are building the pipeline accordingly so that where the opportunities present itself, we can take advantage of those. Jack, I don't know if you want to add anything.\nExecutives: Yes. The only thing, Brian, I would add is, Sara, we did increase the quality this year, and that showed. We've got better economics this year than we have in the past few. We were more discerning. We were more selective. We did focus more of our attention in the proven and fully developed markets. But we also had great success in some of the new and developing. So I think by being discerning, both in our proven markets and our developing and new markets, we've got better quality. I think that sets the table now for us to take the stair step up that we talked about next year. And I fully expect that if we continue to build this kind of quality, work for another stair step the year after. So we focus on quality first, and then quantity, second.\nOperator: The next question will come from Andy Barish of Jefferies.\nAnalysts: Just wondering if you could -- I know you've probably given us a bunch of thoughts coming out of your consumer research. But more importantly, on pricing for next year, any initial conclusions on sort of how you're going to approach pricing versus the historical practice of kind of a larger price increase every several years?\nExecutives: I'll let Jack take that.\nExecutives: Yes, Andy, we have mentioned on previous calls, we're open to a whole different approach. We're in the early stages of talking to some outside parties about our menu compared to competition, customers that shop within our menu and are there opportunities. And I think you'll more likely see us take smaller price increases rather than wait 2 or 3 years or so and then take a larger one, but nothing to report right now.\nAnalysts: Okay. And then just a quick follow-up on -- again, looking out to next year, having For Real for the full year, how do you anticipate sort of the marketing windows to kind of fall versus, obviously, the late roll this year?\nExecutives: Yes. So we are still in the planning phases on exactly when and where we want to use national media. But what we feel really good about is we believe we've got the right communication, and now we're working through how we use the right communication vehicles at the right time. But what we do know is we'll have an always-on social, mobile, digital effort, and then we're still working through how we use the traditional mediums throughout the year in 2019.\nOperator: The next question comes from Sharon Zackfia of William Blair.\nAnalysts: I guess just a follow-up to Andy's question, 3% for marketing, I mean, how are you arriving at that as the right number? And how do we think about that going into 2019?\nExecutives: Yes. So we believe 3% is the right number based on what our planning process is sharing with us. We're using our stage-gate process to really understand what does each initiative provide as far as growth goes, layered on top of our throughput effort. And what we've seen is, as of right now, as we re-approach the marketing budget, we're going to change the allocation from a lot of local marketing to more national. And in that switch, it changes the level of visibility that we can achieve with our marketing dollar. So I think you'll -- what should happen is our 3% should feel like we're much bigger than what our 3% has been historically. And that's our ingoing assumption. Obviously, if we find through our stage-gate process that we have an opportunity to enhance the marketing because the result matches the increased investment, then we'll do that opportunistically. But the going-in plan is to make more out of the 3% than we have in the past.\nAnalysts: Can I ask just a quick follow-up? For 2018, what percent of that marketing budget is digital?\nExecutives: Chris, do you know that off the top of your head?\nExecutives: It's -- so -- I don't know the answer off the top, and I don't know that we necessarily want to give everybody a clue into that. But clearly, with our consumer base going more millennial and more Gen Z, that digital is an integral part of the program for us. And one of the things, we have a lot of things going on with stage gate in terms of 5 initiatives but even the media that we're running, we're constantly in the state of where we look at how it goes and how we evaluate it and to how it moves the business, and we'll feel free to shift things between more traditional linear media and digital media as the results warrant.\nOperator: The next question will come from David Palmer of RBC Capital Markets.\nAnalysts: A couple of follow-ups for me as well. You talked about operations, digital menu innovation, and obviously, you've done a lot of research and testing. But if you were to sort of rank your biggest bucket or buckets of opportunity from this point, how would you do that in terms of what is going to be the biggest source of improvement? I think the assumption might be new menu news being the unlock from here, but I wanted to hear your thoughts.\nExecutives: Yes, look, I don't think new menu news is the primary unlock. I think it plays a role, but I think the digital access, removing friction and getting into digital access is a big unlock for the Chipotle business. Throughput, reclaiming our throughput capability, is another big unlock. And then, obviously, I think making the brand more visible and more resonant with this For Real campaign is another unlock. So menu will play a role, but I think you're going to find digital and the combination of throughput and reminding people why they love Chipotle are going to be the big unlock.\nAnalysts: And, Jack, in the past, you've had these rules of thumbs about margins -- restaurant-level margins and their commensurate level of sales per unit. How has your thinking been changing on that? Obviously, you see innovation in delivery or things that bring complexity, and you think that could be margin dilutive. And on the other side, you've talked about productivity, and of course, there's labor inflation and pricing. So how does -- have you really shifted how you think about what margins are possible at what levels of sales?\nExecutives: No, David. We go through and study this carefully. And I think everything with digital, with delivery, we feel good that there's -- anytime there's an added cost, that there's an opportunity for an efficiency there. So I still think if we get the $2.1 million, we can be in the 21% margin. $2.2 million is at 22% margin. Wage inflation is a bit of a wildcard. We can't overcome that with transaction growth alone. That will require some careful timing and place in the menu price increases. But if we can use well-thought-out menu price increases to make sure that we manage labor inflation, the model is still intact. And there's efficiencies of moving our customers from the front line to the second make-line. And then it's a matter of working with our delivery partners to make sure that the economics work for both us and them. But everything I've said in the past, David, still intact.\nOperator: The next question will come from Karen Holthouse of Goldman Sachs.\nAnalysts: Two quick housekeeping questions, and I have another one. What was the actual cost of the manager conference in the quarter? And what are you working for, for a stock comp for the year?\nExecutives: What was the number for the conference?\nExecutives: It was like $11 -- $10 million in the quarter, $11 million for the year. Stock comp for the year is in the -- between $60 million and $65 million.\nAnalysts: And then as we've started to see some of the marketing digital initiatives take hold, is there anything you're seeing in terms of regional variations in the comp performance? And what I'm really getting at are markets that might be thought of as having more competition in sort of the overall fast-casual space and, specifically, with concepts that share a lot of the same philosophies and values around food quality and sourcing. Are those regions keeping pace with the system?\nExecutives: Yes. We're not seeing big variations in performance based on the initiatives that we've rolled out to date. And when we've done our stage-gate process, we've tried to be true to representing the full United States, so we get a picture of how this performs across the country. So, no, we've not seen that issue.\nOperator: The next question will come from Matt McGinley of Evercore ISI.\nAnalysts: On the labor rate in the quarter, you did a good job of managing that relative to what you had anticipated your totals would be in July. What improved relative to what you assumed back in July?\nExecutives: I missed the first part of your question. Sorry, you cut out.\nAnalysts: The labor rate looked a little bit better than you had guided in July, and I'm curious what came in better than what you anticipated from a labor standpoint?\nExecutives: Yes. Two things. Our teams worked really hard to manage workers' comp, and workers' comp is something that you don't see the benefit week-by-week or month-by-month, but we saw a steady progress throughout the year, and so we're able to make an adjustment there. And then secondly, Scott and the team, they challenged the team during the third quarter to really take a close look at staffing and making sure you've got the right people throughout the day. And so we saw some efficiency gains throughout the quarter as well. So those are the 2 things that -- and I agree with you that we did a nicer job with labor in the third quarter than we did in the second quarter.\nAnalysts: In the quarter, you ran a few offers to grow digital usage. I think you ran a BOGO, and you had the free delivery offer. Did that have any impact on the margin? And is promotion something that you would use on a go-forward basis to drive utilization of that? Or would you expect it to be more of just -- a more natural increase in digital usage as awareness of the platform builds?\nExecutives: Let me answer the latter part of the question, and I can hand it back to Jack on your margin question. But, yes, what we have seen is when we increase awareness of the digital platforms, we get a good response. And I think, over time, our loyalty program and using analytics to inform how we incentivize behaviors is going to be the future. You'll see us continue to use what I will call broad-scale incentives as we build the database and get people into our loyalty program, get people using the mobile app. But where we're ultimately headed is we want -- I think we're less than 50% awareness on these digital platforms. We need to improve that dramatically. And then once we get them into the platform, we need to create a capability around using analytics to drive the right incentives for the right cohort at the right time. So with that approach, we think good things happen throughout the entire P&L. But, Jack, I don't know if you want to add anything else.\nExecutives: Yes. I must add I think it was well said. You answered it. It does have a theoretical impact on our margin. We give away guacamole. Guacamole, our customers love it. It comes with more than 50% of our transactions. And we gave away a lot of it that we planned to giving it away for 1 day, we gave it away for 2 days. But not anything that I would call out when you look at $1.2 billion in sales over the entire quarter. It wasn't material enough to look at. But it's an investment worth making because we attract a lot of people into our digital platform, and so it's an investment that will pay off. So it has a theoretical impact on the margin but not enough to call out during the quarter.\nOperator: The next question will come from Jeffrey Bernstein of Barclays.\nAnalysts: Two questions. One, just following up on the unit growth discussion. I mean, clearly, you're up in the absolute number in '19. I was wondering how you actually arrived at that absolute number. I mean, you talked about how there's lots of opportunities and different types of stores that you could do, and I know a few years back, you were doing well north of 200 stores a year. So I'm wondering how you think about maybe what are the guardrails or challenges to a greater stair step in growth? I don't know if you think there are certain markets that are at saturation? Or is it real estate availability or cost to build or quality of managers? I'm just wondering what keeps you from ramping up that number more meaningfully in the short term?\nExecutives: Look, I think one of the things that always has to go hand-in-hand with new restaurants is having managers ready to take over those new restaurants. So you have to take it at a measured pace, as we increase year-to-year because the last thing you want to be doing is opening restaurants ahead of your capability to run them. The good news is I think our economic models suggest we still have room to grow in a meaningful way. And the Chipotle employee value proposition is very compelling, so we're able to attract managers, apprentices to get them prepared and developed so that they can be a part of the growth story as well. So it's really -- it's that balancing act of you've got to have the teams ready to work and lead the restaurant, coupled with making sure you've got the right economic sites available to open them. You can't just all of a sudden -- well, you could, but we're not going to just go guardrail to guardrail on this thing. I think we would find ourselves not executing very well. So those are the principles we're using.\nAnalysts: Got it. And then you mentioned the unlocks earlier, which I thought was interesting. You didn't mention anything about, I guess, maybe extended store hours. I know there was some talk of selling burritos earlier in the day or going into breakfast or I know in certain markets you're now doing more late-night initiatives. I'm just wondering how you assess what extended hours might work, what might not work and the potential opportunity.\nExecutives: Yes, I think one of the things we learned through the stage-gate process is hours is going to be a surgical approach. It's not a once initiative. And so in the light of that, we learned that in pilots as opposed to on a national level. So you'll see our hours be very surgical. Where it makes sense, you'll see us at different hours, but it's not going to be a national blunt effort.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Brian Niccol for any closing remarks.\nExecutives: Okay. Thanks to everybody for listening and joining in. I think as I've said in my early remarks, very proud of what this team has accomplished in the third quarter. I do believe our strategy to win today and cultivate the future is making tremendous progress. The team that we're building in the support center, I am very excited about diversity of the talent and the caliber of the talent. I'm also very excited about how we've moved all these initiatives forward while moving the company to a new cultural space through this relocation and restructuring. So the Chipotle brand continues to be a purpose-driven brand that we continue to learn over and over again, it means a lot to our customers. It means a lot to our team members and very proud of what we accomplished to date and also very optimistic about the pipeline that we're building and the initiatives that we're focused on going forward. So thank you for taking the time and look forward to speaking with all of you in the future. Take care.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines. Have a great day.\nOperator: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Chipotle Q3 2018 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Coralie Witter. Please go ahead.\nExecutives: Hi, everyone, and welcome to our call today. By now, you should have access to our earnings announcement released this afternoon for the third quarter of 2018. It may also be found on our Investor Relations website at ir.chipotle.com.\nBefore we begin our presentation, I will remind everyone that parts of our discussion today will include forward-looking statements as defined in the securities laws. These forward-looking statements will include statements regarding our outlook for the fourth quarter; the potential of a number of our digital sales strategies; sales trends and forecasts for future comparable sales; expected new restaurant openings; estimates on future food, labor, marketing and maintenance and repair costs and G&A spend; statements about our expected effective tax rate and projections of the amount and timing of transformation and restructuring costs and stock repurchases; as well as other statements of our expectations and plans. These statements are based on information available to us today, and we are not assuming any obligation to update them.\nForward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. We refer you to the risk factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K as updated and our subsequent Form 10-Qs for a discussion of these risks.\nOur discussion today will also include non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations of which can be found on the Presentation page of the Investor Relations section of our website, which can be found at the link included on the Presentation page.\nI'd also like to remind everyone that we have adopted a self-imposed quiet period, restricting communications with investors during that period. The quiet period will begin on the 16th day of the last month of each fiscal quarter and continues until the next earnings conference call. For the fourth quarter of 2018, it will begin December 16 and continue through our fourth quarter earnings release.\nWe will start today's call with some prepared remarks from: Brian Niccol, Chief Executive Officer; and Jack Hartung, Chief Financial Officer, after which we will take questions. Our entire executive leadership team is available during the Q&A period. \nAnd now I will turn the call over to Brian Niccol.\nExecutives: Thanks, Coralie, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report our third quarter results, which demonstrated that our strategy to win today and cultivate a better future are working. Total overall sales grew 8.6% to $1.2 billion, driven by comparable restaurant sales increases of 4.4% and 28 new restaurants opened in the quarter. The positive comp sales trend enabled us to expand restaurant-level margin, which were up 260 basis points year-over-year to 18.7%. Earnings per share adjusted for unusual costs grew 62% to $2.16, and our GAAP earnings were $1.36.\nWhile the quarter experienced some sales headwinds, we had a noticeable lift in sales with the launch of our new For Real marketing campaign in late September. And that increase has sustained through October. Marketing that drives culture, drives difference and drives purchase, combined with great operations, drives results.\nAdditionally in Q3, key growth initiatives moved forward at a healthy pace, and the team executed with excellence the relocation, the restructuring, the hiring of new talent and our All Managers' Conference. We exit the quarter with momentum, which sets us up for a solid fourth quarter, and we remain focused on building a culture of innovation and great execution that will drive sustainable long-term growth.\nBefore I dive deeper into this quarter's bright spots, I'd like to take a step back to remind you that our strategy to win today and cultivate the future is based on 5 focus areas: one, becoming a more culturally relevant and engaging brand that builds love and loyalty; two, digitizing and modernizing our restaurant experience to create a more convenient and enjoyable guest experience; three, running great restaurants with great hospitality and throughput; four, being disciplined and focused to enhance our powerful economic model; and five, building a great culture that can innovate and execute across digital, access, menu and the restaurant experience.\nThis quarter, we've made strides toward becoming a more culturally relevant and engaging brand. Our For Real campaign celebrates what is uniquely Chipotle, that our food reflects our belief that there's a connection between how food is raised and prepared and how it tastes. Real flavors, real ingredients and real cooking techniques result in food that simply tastes better.\nWe are making much better use of our advertising budget by more effectively communicating who we are and by being in better communication channels, thereby increasing our resonance and visibility. We'll continue to be present on national TV through the middle of November, and the For Real messaging will remain visible in digital and social channels for the balance of the year. Going forward, you can expect Chipotle to have a presence in national media where and when it makes sense and to have an always-on social and digital program.\nWhile we are a brand that speaks to everyone, our consumer research tells us that we are particularly relevant to millennials and Gen Z consumers who share our values, and our customers also want to be our employees. During September, we hosted our All Managers' Conference, and it was clear from looking at our general managers and field leaders in the audience that they reflect our customer base. Our teams came away from this conference energized around our purpose, our values and our goals and ready to get back to their restaurants armed with inspiration and information on how to improve the hiring experience, the training experience and the guest experience.\nIn Q3, we made progress on our purpose of cultivating a better world with the announcement of a new accelerated program called the Chipotle Aluminaries Project. This is funded by our Chipotle Cultivate Foundation to help food-focused, growth-stage ventures that share our belief of cultivating a better world and are seeking to disrupt the current food landscape and take their business to the next level.\nWe are using insights from our consumer research to refine our innovation pipeline and how we communicate with our guests. We continue to hear that the #1 reason that consumers eat elsewhere is because they don't have convenient access to Chipotle. Expanding the reach of our digital system remains a key priority in providing our guests with easier access and greater convenience. The digitized second make-lines are now in nearly 750 restaurants and continue to be on track to be in all restaurants by the end of next year. The digital pickup shelves are now in nearly 350 restaurants, and we are moving quickly to get them in all our restaurants before the middle of 2019.\nWe continued to build momentum in digital this quarter, with digital sales growing 48%, accelerating from the year-over-year growth rate we saw in the first half of this year and now accounting for 11.2% of sales. App downloads have increased 25% since last quarter, and we are seeing strong interest from new and infrequent customers, as well as frequent customers.\nAs was the case last quarter, we are seeing particularly strong momentum from delivery. In Q2, we added DoorDash as a new partner, and in Q3, we added delivery capabilities directly from our app and website. A free delivery promotion from our app in September drove an acceleration in delivery sales in the quarter. We continue to see good incrementality in delivery, and we see very little customer overlap between our own in-app delivery and our third-party delivery partner app. We are pleased with how delivery in our app is attracting and retaining new and lapsed customers, and the results we're seeing across our delivery channels validate our strategy to be available wherever and however our guests want to access us.\nAs we continue to remove friction from the digital ordering and pickup process, we would expect our delivery time advantage to continue to widen. Our current average delivery time is under 30 minutes, already making us one of the most attractive choices for customers on our delivery partner's website, and this will keep getting better.\nAs part of our goal to increase access, we are also exploring a new format that leverages digitally enabled convenience. We're pleased with the early results from our initial digital pickup lane restaurants, and we will expand this test to additional new restaurants in 2019 across several markets. These restaurants have a convenient drive-up window for guests to pick up digital orders. It's clear from these tests that our guests appreciate the added convenience, as these restaurants generate digital sales that are far above our national average. This format is also a win for operations, as the window leverages are digital make-line.\nWe're also excited about our loyalty test, which were launched in September in 3 test markets. It's very early, but sign-ups look promising, and we'll evaluate and learn from the loyalty test as it moves to the stage gate in preparation for national launch during 2019.\nWe also have a number of menu items going through our new stage-gate process so that we can build a pipeline for future years. We're testing quesadillas, nachos, bacon, lemonade and a Mexican chocolate milkshake, for example. These items are in different phases of the stage-gate process.\nImportantly, we're improving our ability to deliver great innovations for our customers and restaurant teams with the new concept of screening process, more consumer insight and a better cross-functional process from idea at the launch.\nLastly, I'd like to touch on where we are in our organizational transformation. At our All Managers' Conference last month, we rolled out our new values. These are: one, the line is the moment of truth; two, teach and taste Chipotle; three, authenticity lives here; and four, the movement is real. These values were very well received at the conference by restaurant managers who are more energized than ever. We also emphasized the following key areas for operations to focus on going forward: number one, throughput excellence; number two, team stability and development; number three, great-tasting food; and number four, great customer hospitality. We did a number of store visits following the conference and asked our restaurant managers what they took away. I'm happy to say we are aligned from the support center to each individual restaurant.\nThese values and focus areas also form the foundation for the culture we are building in our support centers, which exist to serve our general managers and team members so that they can delight our guests. I'm pleased with the significant progress we've made in rebuilding Chipotle into an organization with an inclusive culture that sets us up to be more innovative, more connected to what our guests want and better at executing so that we can capitalize on the tremendous growth opportunities in front of us.\nI'm delighted with the great talent that we are attracting, as well as the talent that we're relocating. We've continued to enhance our leadership team, adding Roger Theodoredis as General Counsel, who joined us from WhiteWave. The restructuring and the relocations are nearing completion, and we are building an organization with best-in-class and diverse talent. I love the start-up energy. It greets me every day I come in.\nFinally, before I turn it over to Jack, I want to thank all of our team members across the company that are providing our guests with a great experience, serving real food cooked to perfection and prepared in our restaurants with fresh ingredients. I'd also like to thank our general managers who collectively do a great job managing the restaurant P&L during quarter 3, enabling Chipotle to deliver on financial commitment.\nOkay, over to you, Jack.\nExecutives: Thanks, Brian. I'm equally pleased with how our team rose to the occasion and didn't miss a beat, despite managing a significant restructuring to deliver a solid quarter and great sales momentum that has carried into the fourth quarter. We generated revenue of $1.2 billion during the quarter, an increase of 8.6% from last year on comp sales growth of 4.4%. Restaurant-level margins of 18.7% expanded 260 basis points from last year, contributing to underlying earnings per share, adjusted for unusual items, up 62% to $2.16. The third quarter had unusual expenses, mostly related to the transformation, and that negatively impacted our tax rate and our earnings per share by about $0.80, leading to GAAP earnings per share of $1.36. As discussed last quarter, we'll continue to see costs over the next few quarters associated with our restructuring, relocation and underperforming store closures.\nIn Q3, we recognized $26 million in total charges, with $10 million related to underperforming or closed restaurants and $16 million related to the organizational restructuring and other unusual expenses. As a result of the transformation as well as noncash tax items, our reported effective tax rate increased to 36.8% or about 690 basis points higher than underlying effective tax rate of 29.9%, which I'll explain later.\nThe Q3 comp of 4.4% was primarily driven by higher average check from the price increase taken last November and January and, to a lesser extent, the addition of queso to our menu. During the quarter, comps were in the mid-single digits during July and August before softening to low single digits in September, when we compared to the advertised launch of queso in 2017. With the launch of our For Real campaign with national TV in late September, comps moved back up and are running 4% so far in October. Looking to Q4, we'll lap the price increase in about 1,000 restaurants in November, which will be a headwind to our overall Q4 comp by about 100 basis points.\nWe would typically provide a first glance of our comp guidance for 2019 right now, but with a growing pipeline of initiatives still early on in the stage-gate process, we'll hold off in providing 2019 comp guidance until we have a better perspective of the timing and expected impact of each of these initiatives.\nWe opened 28 new restaurants in the quarter and continue to expect to be at the lower end of our 130 to 150 new openings guidance for the full year. Our new restaurants this year have opened at stronger levels, and we continue to emphasize high-quality, high returning new restaurants as we build out the pipeline. As a result of these strong unit economics, combined with a healthy pipeline for next year's opening, we expect to open between 140 to 155 new restaurants in 2019.\nAs mentioned on our last call, we expect to close between 55 and 65 underperforming restaurants. In the third quarter, we closed 32 of these restaurants and 38 in total, including the 6 closed in Q2, all related to the restructuring. The remaining underperforming restaurants will close over the next several quarters, as we pursue strategic alternatives to manage our future rent liability.\nFood costs for the quarter were 33.4%, a decrease of 160 basis points from the 35% in Q3 of last year. The decrease from last year was driven by the menu price increase as well as more favorable avocado prices. These were offset by elevated prices for beef and paper and packaging items. We expect to be in the low 33% range in Q4, with a slight decrease from Q3 due to the shift in the supply of avocados back to Mexico, Peru and Chile.\nLabor costs for the quarter were 27.2% or flat compared to Q3 of last year. The price increase offset wage inflation of about 4% to 5%. We also decreased our workers' comp liability by about $4 million in the quarter due to better management of claims activity so far this year. We expect labor costs to increase to the mid-28% range in Q4, as a result of deleverage from seasonally lower sales as well as continued wage pressure.\nOccupancy costs for the quarter were 7.1%, a decrease of 30 basis points compared to Q3 last year, and that's due mostly to the increase in comp sales.\nOther operating costs for the quarter were 13.7%, a decrease of 70 basis points from Q3 of last year.\nOur marketing and promo costs were 2.5% in the quarter, a decrease of about 70 basis points compared to Q3 of last year. The lower-than-expected marketing in Q3 is due to a timing shift into Q4 as our For Real campaign began in late September and will continue through mid-November. As a result, we expect marketing and promo costs will be in the low 4% of sales during Q4, while full year marketing and promo will still be right around 3% of sales overall for the year.\nOther operating costs continue to include about 30 basis points of higher maintenance and repair costs, which we first discussed on the Q4 2017 call, and we expect M&R to continue at this elevated level for the rest of the year before abating in 2019.\nG&A in the quarter increased $24 million compared to Q2 of this year. The increase compared to last quarter was primarily due to $16 million in charges related to the restructuring and other unusual charges in the quarter, as well as $11 million for our biennial All Managers' Conference. Compared to Q3 of last year, the items I just listed mostly offset the one-time charge we had in same quarter of last year.\nUnderlying G&A increased compared to last year, primarily in support of our restaurant growth and digitizing our restaurant experience and operational leadership changes in the field. For Q4, we expect total G&A to be right around $95 million, which includes an estimated $10 million to $12 million of restructuring-related expenses. Underlying G&A in Q4, excluding bonuses and stock comp, is expected to be at similar levels as Q2 and Q3 of this year. However, both bonuses and stock comp are expected to be higher year-over-year as a result of better performance.\nDepreciation for the quarter was 4.3%, an increase of 60 basis points from the 3.7% in Q3 of last year. This increase is due to the accelerated depreciation for the restaurant closures we discussed earlier and, to a lesser extent, accelerated depreciation from the office closures.\nWe now expect transformation costs from restructuring and restaurant closures and certain other charges to total between $100 million and $120 million versus our initial estimate of $115 million to $135 million, again, with most hitting in 2018. So far this year, we charged nearly $70 million, and we estimate that another $10 million to $25 million will hit in Q4. And the remaining charges, mostly related to terminating restaurant and office leases, will spill into 2019. We'll continue to provide specific and future transformation-related costs when we have more certainty around timing, and we'll break out the unusual costs from normal costs so you can follow the underlying trend.\nOur pretax income was $58.5 million, and the reported effective tax rate was 36.8%. Our 36.8% reported effective tax rate was higher than our 29.9% underlying rate due to the transformation costs and noncash tax items related to the write-off of deferred tax assets associated with the underwater option. While we anticipate the underlying rate in Q4 to remain in the 28.9% to 29.9% range, we anticipate our effective Q4 tax rate to be in the high 30% range or higher due to the impact of transformation charges as well as anticipated additional noncash debt write-off.\nDuring the quarter, we repurchased $19 million of our stock at an average price of $474 per share, leaving about $100 million in our current buyback authorization. Our buyback rate will remain at this lower level as we fund the transformation costs. This decrease is short-term, and we expect to return opportunistically repurchasing shares at a higher level once we've completed the restructuring.\nWe're encouraged by our third quarter results, as our teams demonstrated that they can stay focused on serving our guests and executing growth drivers while also being nimble on managing the business. Meanwhile, our support center made important progress in relocating and hiring talent, hosting our All Managers' Conference and rebuilding an organizational structure designed to innovate and deliver on commitments to our guests, to our employees and to our shareholders.\nAnd now we're happy to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question will come from David Tarantino of Baird.\nAnalysts: Just a couple of questions on the comp trends. First, Brian or Jack, could you maybe talk about your estimate of the impact, if there was any, from the Ohio incident that was pretty well-publicized? And I guess, based on how you look at the business, looking at maybe your average daily sales trends and seasonally adjusted for that, do you think this most recent uplift from the marketing program has got your back on trend if there was an impact in Q3? And then I have a couple of follow-ups.\nExecutives: Yes, David, this is Jack. There was a lot going on in the quarter. We compared in the middle of the quarter to some soft results from the last year. We had avocado day that turned into a double day once we broke the Internet. We had a back-to-school promotion that we compared to queso, and then we had marketing at the end. So teasing out any single impact was very difficult. That's why I walked through and I wanted to give the comp trends throughout the quarter. The thing that we know for sure is that marketing did have an impact. As we went on air and as customers started seeing the commercials, we did see an improvement in our sales. And I think when I looked through the net-net of it, by the time we left the quarter, I don't think there's any lasting impact of anything that happened in Ohio.\nAnalysts: Great. That's helpful, Jack. And then on the quarter-to-date, you mentioned up 4% for the comp. I know you're cycling now the mix benefits you have with the queso. So I guess is traffic now running positive in the quarter-to-date period behind the advertising?\nExecutives: David, it's right around flattish. When you look at the 4%, we're still carrying a price increase, and about a couple thousand restaurants will lap the next wave in November and then the final wave in January. So I've called the traffic right around flat.\nAnalysts: Great. And then last question for Brian. You talked a lot about the stage-gate process with some of the menu innovation you're working on. So I guess, at a high level, when do you think we'll start seeing some new items added to the menu? And then if you can maybe share your perspective on what you've learned in adding new items to the menu and the operating model.\nExecutives: Sure. So yes, we've got, obviously, a couple items in the stage-gate process on various stages, actually, both digital initiatives as well as food initiatives. And I think you're going to see both a digital, the total system, from loyalty to our mobile app to our digital shelves, all those things are in test markets right now, and we're very optimistic about what we're seeing. And we're continuing to learn. And the plan is they will start to touch, in 2019, consumers. Same thing with a food initiative or 2. So we're still early days, David, but we're learning a lot. We're optimistic about what we're seeing. And we're feeling like the stage-gate process is working, and it's going to set us up to execute with excellence when some of these initiatives come to market in 2019.\nOperator: The next question will come from John Glass of Morgan Stanley.\nAnalysts: Could you -- there were a couple of operational initiatives, Brian, you talked about, either on or off-line, during the quarter, including throughput, seemed like an early opportunity for you. And I think you talked about maybe purchasing -- professionalize in that organization. So some of the operational things that you're taking on, where are you on those? And do they have any impact on the past quarter?\nExecutives: So we are early days into both of those. And the good news is, I would say, our operational focus, I feel like we're out of the starting blocks with getting our throughput to a higher level than where we've been. But really, our focus was, at our All Managers' Conference, to get everybody aligned on values so that we're hiring the right people, so that ultimately, we can end up with a stable team with the right leaders. And then the other key focus for that meeting was to make sure people understood we're getting back to the throughput excellence, great-tasting food. You do those 2 things, you end up with great customer hospitality. And what I love is I feel like we're out of the blocks on all these things, and we should -- as we go into 2019, we'll continue to make progress as opposed to just getting started with it in 2019. And the same thing goes for the supply chain leadership. Carlos, actually, myself and Jack, we've already started our visits with some of our key partners, and it's been great to understand the relationship that was started, in some cases, 25 years ago to some that are relatively new. And the good news is I think this is an iterative process, where there's opportunities for Chipotle and our suppliers to benefit going forward. So very optimistic on both of those fronts, and I feel like a lot of good work has been put in place so that when we walk into 2019, we'll start to see some real tangible benefits.\nAnalysts: Just one more for me. On the digital sales growth this quarter, which is impressive, do you -- are you seeing the operational benefits you hoped, particularly some of maybe the margin benefit you hoped utilizing the second make-line? Or is it too early and you have to get sort of a threshold of volume going through that second make-line to really start to see some of the margin leverage benefit that you might expect?\nExecutives: Yes. I think it's a little too early on the margin side of it. But one of the things that's been great to see is where we have the digital make-line, where we have our shelves, and you've got this -- obviously, the customer app everywhere, we're seeing increases in customer satisfaction. And we're continuing to see a higher ticket, and it's playing across all those digital channels that you'd expect: the app, the web and in delivery.\nOperator: The next question will come from Nicole Miller of Piper Jaffray.\nAnalysts: It seems to me you've had -- or you're in the midst of a headquarter cultural re-siding combination with what is store alignment, that can be actually very powerful. So I'm curious, what are today's store-level incentive metrics? And I've noticed on some of my visits, some customer contacts in the dining room. And I'm wondering, is that a particular element that you're focusing on?\nExecutives: Yes, absolutely. We are very much focused on -- we want people to walk away from Chipotle with a [ great ] guest experience. And I think you heard me mention this, when we say the line is the moment of truth, we believe the whole stage is set from the second you see our line. And those are both digital lines, as well as our customer-facing line. And I think what Scott and his team have been also focused on is we've got to make sure our hospitality matches that line experience. So you will see some table touches. You'll see what Scott calls his 4 cornerstones start to roll out across the system. So I'm delighted to hear that you're seeing that firsthand.\nAnalysts: And could you speak more specifically about the incentive metrics for the store-level employees?\nExecutives: Sure. We can talk a little bit more about that. Scott, I don't know if you want to chime in here, but this is all based on our restaurant AB scorecard. So much...\nExecutives: Scott here. Yes, so our incentives currently are tied to our AB scorecard, which encompasses sales and profits, obviously, but also incorporates the guest experience, food safety, obviously, being paramount to our business. As -- and so when we lathered that up, we understand where we are from a business unit perspective. And everyone is driving to reach the A level. We've had -- we've made great progress this year of getting there. So I hope that answers your question around incentives specifically.\nAnalysts: That's very helpful. And then just the last question. Brian, when you first talked to us a couple of conference calls ago, you talked a lot about enhancing and aiding the Chipotle awareness. And today, I heard you talk about customers wanting accessibility. So could you compare and contrast those opportunities? And how are you approaching and prioritizing the strategies and tactics between those 2 opportunities?\nExecutives: Yes. I think you picked up on what I think are the 2 biggest levers outside of our operational excellence, around throughput and great hospitality. I think what you just saw with the For Real marketing campaign -- and this is what I meant by being more visible and also being more focused on what makes Chipotle uniquely different. So you're going to continue to see us push very hard on getting across what makes Chipotle different, what makes Chipotle driving culture, food culture, and then obviously, we want our marketing to be driving the purchase as well. And I think that can be done at the brand level, which is very exciting for Chipotle because I think our purpose is powerful. The other big lever for us is access, and I think it's going to be driven by this digital access. So those are 2 things that we are very focused on getting front and center. And then, obviously, I think there are opportunities for menu variety and few other things that we talked about. But the 2 biggest focus areas here in the very near term are the visibility of the Chipotle brand and purpose because I think we're creating a new category with folks and changing food culture. And when we're much more visible with it, customers respond and then, the digital access aspect is another place where we're seeing great response across that whole digital system that we're rolling out.\nAnalysts: So is it fair maybe for us to think about awareness is really generating the call to action and that access [ to distribution is ] reducing the friction to get to you? Is that right?\nExecutives: Yes, well said. I should have started there.\nOperator: The next question will come from Sara Senatore of Bernstein.\nAnalysts: I have 2 follow-ups. One, just on traffic. I think in the past, we've heard there's been a bit of a struggle with frequency in the sense of just all tiers of customers maybe coming a little bit less. And I was wondering if you could talk about what you're seeing there. Is this where loyalty comes in? Or is it the new menu items that will bring people back more frequently? So besides access, what are customers telling you that they want to see most in order to sort of ramp up that frequency curve, which used to be such a tailwind to the Chipotle comp? And then I have another one.\nExecutives: Sure. So yes, what we've seen, and this is early days, is with our loyalty pilot, we're seeing people that have less frequency answering the program. And we don't have enough time to truly understand what ultimately is going to be the impact on our frequency, but we're very excited about the cohort that we're seeing come in to the loyalty program in the early days. So we think that is going to play out, where that program will be a key vehicle for driving frequency among the cohort, but today, I have [ not seen them reduce their ] frequency. Another thing that's really been exciting is a lot of our digital business is attracting new and lapsed users to our business. So that's been another really exciting learning for us. And then I think your point on what about the people that historically were coming all the time, I think that's where we need to get back to talking about what makes Chipotle unique in culture, visible food culture, what makes our purpose so different because that really resonates with our heavy users that are bought in. And we've seen some early indications that, that's a great way to drive frequency into our loyalists.\nAnalysts: That's helpful. And then just on the unit, you were sort of at the low end of the range this year but obviously will be above that in fiscal '19, according to the guidance. I'm just trying to understand the extent to which this year's build rate was maybe a function of just reestablishing your growth pipeline or your development, kind of how you approach it versus just the -- how many attractive trade areas are left. Next year, I guess, would we expect to see more of a mix shift towards some of the newer or less established? Or are you going to continue to mostly focus on these established markets?\nExecutives: I'll answer, and then I'll let Jack chime in as well. But yes, look, what we're really excited about is the restaurants that we opened this year opened very strong. And the economic support continuing to open Chipotle restaurants above the rate of which we opened this year. And I think that was the guidance which I shared with you all. The thing that's also exciting about Chipotle is we're finding we're having success in some new formats. As I've mentioned in the earlier statements, the digital pickup lane is a very exciting proposition. We're going to do more of those next year. We're also very excited about how we're seeing success in proven markets and the new markets that we got the brakes on, frankly, a while ago. But the economic model of new restaurant openings is very powerful, and as such, we are building the pipeline accordingly so that where the opportunities present itself, we can take advantage of those. Jack, I don't know if you want to add anything.\nExecutives: Yes. The only thing, Brian, I would add is, Sara, we did increase the quality this year, and that showed. We've got better economics this year than we have in the past few. We were more discerning. We were more selective. We did focus more of our attention in the proven and fully developed markets. But we also had great success in some of the new and developing. So I think by being discerning, both in our proven markets and our developing and new markets, we've got better quality. I think that sets the table now for us to take the stair step up that we talked about next year. And I fully expect that if we continue to build this kind of quality, work for another stair step the year after. So we focus on quality first, and then quantity, second.\nOperator: The next question will come from Andy Barish of Jefferies.\nAnalysts: Just wondering if you could -- I know you've probably given us a bunch of thoughts coming out of your consumer research. But more importantly, on pricing for next year, any initial conclusions on sort of how you're going to approach pricing versus the historical practice of kind of a larger price increase every several years?\nExecutives: I'll let Jack take that.\nExecutives: Yes, Andy, we have mentioned on previous calls, we're open to a whole different approach. We're in the early stages of talking to some outside parties about our menu compared to competition, customers that shop within our menu and are there opportunities. And I think you'll more likely see us take smaller price increases rather than wait 2 or 3 years or so and then take a larger one, but nothing to report right now.\nAnalysts: Okay. And then just a quick follow-up on -- again, looking out to next year, having For Real for the full year, how do you anticipate sort of the marketing windows to kind of fall versus, obviously, the late roll this year?\nExecutives: Yes. So we are still in the planning phases on exactly when and where we want to use national media. But what we feel really good about is we believe we've got the right communication, and now we're working through how we use the right communication vehicles at the right time. But what we do know is we'll have an always-on social, mobile, digital effort, and then we're still working through how we use the traditional mediums throughout the year in 2019.\nOperator: The next question comes from Sharon Zackfia of William Blair.\nAnalysts: I guess just a follow-up to Andy's question, 3% for marketing, I mean, how are you arriving at that as the right number? And how do we think about that going into 2019?\nExecutives: Yes. So we believe 3% is the right number based on what our planning process is sharing with us. We're using our stage-gate process to really understand what does each initiative provide as far as growth goes, layered on top of our throughput effort. And what we've seen is, as of right now, as we re-approach the marketing budget, we're going to change the allocation from a lot of local marketing to more national. And in that switch, it changes the level of visibility that we can achieve with our marketing dollar. So I think you'll -- what should happen is our 3% should feel like we're much bigger than what our 3% has been historically. And that's our ingoing assumption. Obviously, if we find through our stage-gate process that we have an opportunity to enhance the marketing because the result matches the increased investment, then we'll do that opportunistically. But the going-in plan is to make more out of the 3% than we have in the past.\nAnalysts: Can I ask just a quick follow-up? For 2018, what percent of that marketing budget is digital?\nExecutives: Chris, do you know that off the top of your head?\nExecutives: It's -- so -- I don't know the answer off the top, and I don't know that we necessarily want to give everybody a clue into that. But clearly, with our consumer base going more millennial and more Gen Z, that digital is an integral part of the program for us. And one of the things, we have a lot of things going on with stage gate in terms of 5 initiatives but even the media that we're running, we're constantly in the state of where we look at how it goes and how we evaluate it and to how it moves the business, and we'll feel free to shift things between more traditional linear media and digital media as the results warrant.\nOperator: The next question will come from David Palmer of RBC Capital Markets.\nAnalysts: A couple of follow-ups for me as well. You talked about operations, digital menu innovation, and obviously, you've done a lot of research and testing. But if you were to sort of rank your biggest bucket or buckets of opportunity from this point, how would you do that in terms of what is going to be the biggest source of improvement? I think the assumption might be new menu news being the unlock from here, but I wanted to hear your thoughts.\nExecutives: Yes, look, I don't think new menu news is the primary unlock. I think it plays a role, but I think the digital access, removing friction and getting into digital access is a big unlock for the Chipotle business. Throughput, reclaiming our throughput capability, is another big unlock. And then, obviously, I think making the brand more visible and more resonant with this For Real campaign is another unlock. So menu will play a role, but I think you're going to find digital and the combination of throughput and reminding people why they love Chipotle are going to be the big unlock.\nAnalysts: And, Jack, in the past, you've had these rules of thumbs about margins -- restaurant-level margins and their commensurate level of sales per unit. How has your thinking been changing on that? Obviously, you see innovation in delivery or things that bring complexity, and you think that could be margin dilutive. And on the other side, you've talked about productivity, and of course, there's labor inflation and pricing. So how does -- have you really shifted how you think about what margins are possible at what levels of sales?\nExecutives: No, David. We go through and study this carefully. And I think everything with digital, with delivery, we feel good that there's -- anytime there's an added cost, that there's an opportunity for an efficiency there. So I still think if we get the $2.1 million, we can be in the 21% margin. $2.2 million is at 22% margin. Wage inflation is a bit of a wildcard. We can't overcome that with transaction growth alone. That will require some careful timing and place in the menu price increases. But if we can use well-thought-out menu price increases to make sure that we manage labor inflation, the model is still intact. And there's efficiencies of moving our customers from the front line to the second make-line. And then it's a matter of working with our delivery partners to make sure that the economics work for both us and them. But everything I've said in the past, David, still intact.\nOperator: The next question will come from Karen Holthouse of Goldman Sachs.\nAnalysts: Two quick housekeeping questions, and I have another one. What was the actual cost of the manager conference in the quarter? And what are you working for, for a stock comp for the year?\nExecutives: What was the number for the conference?\nExecutives: It was like $11 -- $10 million in the quarter, $11 million for the year. Stock comp for the year is in the -- between $60 million and $65 million.\nAnalysts: And then as we've started to see some of the marketing digital initiatives take hold, is there anything you're seeing in terms of regional variations in the comp performance? And what I'm really getting at are markets that might be thought of as having more competition in sort of the overall fast-casual space and, specifically, with concepts that share a lot of the same philosophies and values around food quality and sourcing. Are those regions keeping pace with the system?\nExecutives: Yes. We're not seeing big variations in performance based on the initiatives that we've rolled out to date. And when we've done our stage-gate process, we've tried to be true to representing the full United States, so we get a picture of how this performs across the country. So, no, we've not seen that issue.\nOperator: The next question will come from Matt McGinley of Evercore ISI.\nAnalysts: On the labor rate in the quarter, you did a good job of managing that relative to what you had anticipated your totals would be in July. What improved relative to what you assumed back in July?\nExecutives: I missed the first part of your question. Sorry, you cut out.\nAnalysts: The labor rate looked a little bit better than you had guided in July, and I'm curious what came in better than what you anticipated from a labor standpoint?\nExecutives: Yes. Two things. Our teams worked really hard to manage workers' comp, and workers' comp is something that you don't see the benefit week-by-week or month-by-month, but we saw a steady progress throughout the year, and so we're able to make an adjustment there. And then secondly, Scott and the team, they challenged the team during the third quarter to really take a close look at staffing and making sure you've got the right people throughout the day. And so we saw some efficiency gains throughout the quarter as well. So those are the 2 things that -- and I agree with you that we did a nicer job with labor in the third quarter than we did in the second quarter.\nAnalysts: In the quarter, you ran a few offers to grow digital usage. I think you ran a BOGO, and you had the free delivery offer. Did that have any impact on the margin? And is promotion something that you would use on a go-forward basis to drive utilization of that? Or would you expect it to be more of just -- a more natural increase in digital usage as awareness of the platform builds?\nExecutives: Let me answer the latter part of the question, and I can hand it back to Jack on your margin question. But, yes, what we have seen is when we increase awareness of the digital platforms, we get a good response. And I think, over time, our loyalty program and using analytics to inform how we incentivize behaviors is going to be the future. You'll see us continue to use what I will call broad-scale incentives as we build the database and get people into our loyalty program, get people using the mobile app. But where we're ultimately headed is we want -- I think we're less than 50% awareness on these digital platforms. We need to improve that dramatically. And then once we get them into the platform, we need to create a capability around using analytics to drive the right incentives for the right cohort at the right time. So with that approach, we think good things happen throughout the entire P&L. But, Jack, I don't know if you want to add anything else.\nExecutives: Yes. I must add I think it was well said. You answered it. It does have a theoretical impact on our margin. We give away guacamole. Guacamole, our customers love it. It comes with more than 50% of our transactions. And we gave away a lot of it that we planned to giving it away for 1 day, we gave it away for 2 days. But not anything that I would call out when you look at $1.2 billion in sales over the entire quarter. It wasn't material enough to look at. But it's an investment worth making because we attract a lot of people into our digital platform, and so it's an investment that will pay off. So it has a theoretical impact on the margin but not enough to call out during the quarter.\nOperator: The next question will come from Jeffrey Bernstein of Barclays.\nAnalysts: Two questions. One, just following up on the unit growth discussion. I mean, clearly, you're up in the absolute number in '19. I was wondering how you actually arrived at that absolute number. I mean, you talked about how there's lots of opportunities and different types of stores that you could do, and I know a few years back, you were doing well north of 200 stores a year. So I'm wondering how you think about maybe what are the guardrails or challenges to a greater stair step in growth? I don't know if you think there are certain markets that are at saturation? Or is it real estate availability or cost to build or quality of managers? I'm just wondering what keeps you from ramping up that number more meaningfully in the short term?\nExecutives: Look, I think one of the things that always has to go hand-in-hand with new restaurants is having managers ready to take over those new restaurants. So you have to take it at a measured pace, as we increase year-to-year because the last thing you want to be doing is opening restaurants ahead of your capability to run them. The good news is I think our economic models suggest we still have room to grow in a meaningful way. And the Chipotle employee value proposition is very compelling, so we're able to attract managers, apprentices to get them prepared and developed so that they can be a part of the growth story as well. So it's really -- it's that balancing act of you've got to have the teams ready to work and lead the restaurant, coupled with making sure you've got the right economic sites available to open them. You can't just all of a sudden -- well, you could, but we're not going to just go guardrail to guardrail on this thing. I think we would find ourselves not executing very well. So those are the principles we're using.\nAnalysts: Got it. And then you mentioned the unlocks earlier, which I thought was interesting. You didn't mention anything about, I guess, maybe extended store hours. I know there was some talk of selling burritos earlier in the day or going into breakfast or I know in certain markets you're now doing more late-night initiatives. I'm just wondering how you assess what extended hours might work, what might not work and the potential opportunity.\nExecutives: Yes, I think one of the things we learned through the stage-gate process is hours is going to be a surgical approach. It's not a once initiative. And so in the light of that, we learned that in pilots as opposed to on a national level. So you'll see our hours be very surgical. Where it makes sense, you'll see us at different hours, but it's not going to be a national blunt effort.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Brian Niccol for any closing remarks.\nExecutives: Okay. Thanks to everybody for listening and joining in. I think as I've said in my early remarks, very proud of what this team has accomplished in the third quarter. I do believe our strategy to win today and cultivate the future is making tremendous progress. The team that we're building in the support center, I am very excited about diversity of the talent and the caliber of the talent. I'm also very excited about how we've moved all these initiatives forward while moving the company to a new cultural space through this relocation and restructuring. So the Chipotle brand continues to be a purpose-driven brand that we continue to learn over and over again, it means a lot to our customers. It means a lot to our team members and very proud of what we accomplished to date and also very optimistic about the pipeline that we're building and the initiatives that we're focused on going forward. So thank you for taking the time and look forward to speaking with all of you in the future. Take care.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

         "Attendees: Now if there's a company that understands these changes, including machine learning and big data, as well as open source and collaboration, it's Google. You saw one of Google's open source projects, TensorFlow, in today's demo. Just a few minutes, Google Chief Decision Scientist will be here. But before she gives you more information about what intelligent apps will really look like, we'll hear from a shared customer, Kohl's, about their journey with Red Hat and Google. So please welcome Ritch from Kohl's and Cassie from Google.\nAttendees: All right. Most of you know Kohl's as a chain of leading American department stores, but you might not know that there's also been a long-time customer of Red Hat. Ritch, could you tell a little bit about Kohl's and your relationship with us?\nAttendees: Sure thing. So first of all, it's great to be here. I was really looking forward to summit this year, and then I saw Weezer was playing, and that put me right over the top, icing on the cake, so looking forward to that. So Kohl's, we're department store, almost 1,200 stores, 49 states, about $19 billion in revenue. We've got about 1,000 person IT shop, another 2,500 people in managed services around the globe. So big, big technology footprint. We're based in Wisconsin outside Milwaukee, but we also have a tech center here in Silicon Valley, in Milpitas. So long time Red Hat customer. When I got to Kohl's about 8 years ago, there was a small pocket in the data center running RHEL. And it was a distant third out of 3 operating systems at Kohl's. And I look today years later, RHEL is the predominant operating system, and we've just signed on for OpenShift as our PaaS platform and our hybrid cloud effort. We have efforts underway around Gluster, ActiveMQ. We have a relentless automation effort, Ansible plays a big part there. So we are very excited about our future with Red Hat. We've had a good history. The future looks even brighter. It's a big part of our digital transformation.\nExecutives: So we at Google are thrilled to be in this journey with you. Can you tell us a little bit more about why you picked Google as a partner?\nAttendees: Yes. So as we embarked on our hybrid cloud journey, we felt it was important to pick a primary public cloud provider. One cloud provider -- even though multi-cloud's inevitable, we felt 1 primary was the right approach where you would go very deep and understand that platform, all the nuances, how to optimize your workloads to run cost-effectively, how to use networking, all the details and we chose Google, and there's really a few reasons for that. One is we're an existing customer. We use G Suites, adds, but more importantly, there were a few things. One, engineering. We think Google's engineering is really top-notch. And as we did our reference calls, time and time again, we heard that not only is the engineering great, but you have access to the engineering resources. So we felt that was really important. Two, Google, it was really interesting. They said, \"hey, yes, there's GCPD L is great, I appreciate that. But what do you want to do together? Like, what problems do you want to solve and retail?\" And we found that pretty interesting. But I think lastly, the tiebreaker, a lot of great cloud offerings out there, was machine learning. We believe that, like all of you probably, that's the next big unlock in our industry, and we felt that really Google is really the leader in that space and that's where we want to hit our wagon.\nExecutives: That's a topic really close to my heart, and I'm so glad that you've chosen us. Thank you.\nAttendees: So Ritch, you've been moving really quickly and even ahead of many of your peers. So it sounds like Red Hat and Google have both played a role in that. What do we offer both -- what do we both offer together that you don't get elsewhere?\nAttendees: Sure. So I would say that as I've gone through my career, one of the things I've gotten a much greater appreciation for is the value of partnerships. I would say earlier in my career, and then probably spent a lot of energy on that. But having gone through really good partnerships and other partnerships that weren't so good, it can take years, if not a decade, to unwind from some of those decisions that you make, right? So I think the secret is this. The secrets to understand what your values are as a company and then go find partners that align to those values, okay? So with us, it's pretty simple. We're very engineering-led organization, and we feel that you guys both align really nicely to that. Secondly, we're very committed to a future of open source, okay? Not only just open source, but enterprise-grade open source, right, that we can run our business on. So we felt that with the future being so uncertain, we don't know where all this is going 5 years from now. So what you need to do is find a partner that has the right stuff in their DNA so that as new products are announced and new acquisitions are made, you know they're going to continue on that path of engineering-centric and a commitment to open source. So to us, that's really what it's about, that's why we're thrilled to partner with these 2 companies and looking forward to a great future.\nAttendees: Well, thanks a lot. I love hearing the kind of open source collaboration is what really brings this partnership to the forefront. So we'll turn it over to Cassie. Thank you.\nExecutives: So how many of you have that moment where you realized everyone is using some word and you have no idea what that means but you're too afraid to ask at this point. What even is machine learning? Well, it's an approach to making lots of small decisions like data something involving algorithmically finding patterns in data. But let me just put it bluntly so that we can all get it. It's a thing labeler essentially, that's what machine learning is. It's just a thing labeler. So why on earth should you be excited about thing labeling? Well, here's my pet Huxley, and you've just taken in some pretty complicated data through your senses and you just know that that's a cat. And if I show you a different image, you're not fooled, you still know that that label is cat. Your brain just does this, you don't even know how your brain does it. Now if we want to get a computer to perform this labeling task for us, if we went the traditional way, you know this, programmers, we would communicate with the universe in some way, think really deeply about the problem and come up with a model. It's a model, it's just a recipe. It's a set of instructions that a computer has to follow to get from the image to the label. And we would have to hand craft that. Now think about what this recipe would have to be for the computer to correctly detect that there's a cat in the image. I mean, think about what you, your brain actually did with those pixels? Can you express that? Do you know what your brain is doing? Or have you just had the benefit of eons of evolution and it just kind of figures it out for you? Now that recipe is really hard to handcraft. Wouldn't it be better if you could just say to the machine, here, \"look at a bunch of examples of cats, look at a bunch of examples of not cats and just figure it out yourself.\" That is what machine learning is all about. It is a completely different programming paradigm. Now instead of giving explicit instructions, you program with examples, with data and let that machine learning algorithm figure it out and stitch that code that goes in between for you. So why should you actually be excited by this thing labeling? Well, engineers, you know we like to get computers to do stuff for us, and there's a whole class of tasks where we just cannot express the instructions. They're ineffable. AI and machine learning are about automating the ineffable. This is a fundamental leap in human progress. Now you can get computers to do tasks where you cannot possibly express the instructions. This is so exciting and seems futuristic and difficult, right? And when you think about machine learning, the one thing I most want you to think about is microwaves. Who here in the audience knows how a microwave oven works well enough to build a new one from scratch, raise hands? Who can build a new one? do you see any takers, any takers? No hands? Yes, me neither. Who here has never used want to reheat food? You all have. Even though you have no idea how it works, you're still happy to use one, right? And anyone here feel like you what have no idea how to get hold of on, I don't know, like maybe add Kohl's, if you needed one? Now you just told me you have no idea how it works so how could you possibly trust this microwave? Well, you're not going to trust it by reading the wiring diagram, are you? You're going to trust it by taking that it actually does work, by having a good idea that it wanted to do for you and then tasting what comes out on the other side. And that is exactly what you'll do with machine learning, and this is a perfect analogy for machine learning. Now what they don't tell you about machine learning, when we use that term, especially to machine learnings, not 1. 2 completely different disciplines that are as different as building microwaves from scratch and innovating in the kitchen. And you need completely different skill sets for this. If you want to be a machine learning researcher, you are building general-purpose tools for other people to use. And so the bad news there is that there is quite a lot of education that you need to get, it takes a little while to ramp up because how on earth are you going to build a better microwave than the one that exists already, there's some pretty sophisticated stuff out there, if you have no idea how the current 1 works. So that's the bad news. It takes a long want to become a machine learning researcher. The good news though is that if that is your cup of tea, we at Google, have a large machine learning research shop where we make these tools for you that are all powered by open source, so we give you those wiring diagrams as a springboard so that you can go and build a better microwave than what we have using our blueprints. And TensorFlow, a really popular machine learning project, started at Google before we open sourced it because we believe that the community as a whole so much more innovative other than just anyone of us alone. But let's face it, most if you are not here to build general-purpose microwaves. You just want to get cooking already, right? You just want to use these things to solve business problems, and so you are in the completely other discipline, applied machine learning. Now for that, you do not need a PhD. You don't need to know how back propagation works and neural networks any more than a chef needs to know how a microwave is wired. Instead, what you need is a really good kitchen to play in, and we, at Google, provide that for you. Let me show you some of the things that we have. And what you're going to need kind of depends on what you're cooking. If you're cooking with the usual ingredients data and you're making usual dishes, labels, predictions, so say you're making pizza, please don't reinvent the concept of pizza from scratch. There's already recipes out there, and nyou can just grab those recipes and start making pizza, and that is what our cloud APIs are all about. These are recipes that we've already built that you can just pick up and start using. You can just plug them into your apps to make those intelligent applications. But say you're cooking with a little twist. Now it's gluten-free vegan pizza. Well, you still don't need to -- you still don't need to start entirely from scratch. It's still pizza. You can just adjust what already exists out there. And so what we suggest for you here is try cloud auto ML. Sure, maybe we haven't trained our vision system on the clothing type that your Kohl's customers are wearing, but no problem, just feed in your images with your labels and to cloud auto ML, and you'll be good to go with a small adjustment necessary. Now say you're truly innovating. You have your own completely unique ingredients. You're doing something pretty different in the kitchen. I don't know, maybe now you're making an edible sock that taste like pizza. Well, machine learning and innovation are in Google's core DNA. In fact, I can't think of a single one of our consumer products that doesn't have machine learning and it somewhere. And so if you are innovating in the kitchen, if you're building truly new recipes, what we have for you is cloud machine learning engine. This is access to exactly the same infrastructure that Google uses to train our models, incredible. So you could, if you wanted to, after this session, grab a laptop, open it up and test drive our shiny gleaming kitchen with all those appliances ready to go, and you could feel the thrill of the data center and all this cutting-edge algorithms rising up to do your bidding. So solving business problems with machine learning, applied machine learning is a far easier than what most people think. But you don't realize this that all those courses in university, those are all about how to build the microwave. Not just how to use it to get cooking. And when I hear people say \"oh, I couldn't possibly get started with machine learning until I take a course in it or, goodness, it will degree,\" I couldn't help but imagine that same person saying I couldn't possibly use a microwave until I built 1 myself. You can just get cooking. It's not the lack of degree or course or knowledge that's holding you back. What's much, much more important than that, what you need to get started is creativity. Figure out what you're going to cook because all those tools are already there waiting for you to use them. Imagine gleaming kitchens just waiting for you to come play in them. But since this is a thing labeler, you need to start thinking by what on earth do you want labeled and see how creative you can get with that. You might imagine the label being maybe the way or form of that sounds like a voice that could make a hairdressers appointment for you, or you can imagine a few other cases like maybe you are a loving son and your aging parents sort vegetables by hand and you want to save them the trouble of having to do that on their farm so maybe you're thinking about building a system that will label the vegetables and sort it automatically so your parents don't have to do it, or maybe you're worried about the ingredients that go into baby food. And you think it would be great if you could automatically check whether the ingredient is safe or spoiled before it goes in or maybe you're into the idea of a huge bank with trillions of dollars in assets, countering fraud and money laundering automatically across millions of accounts. If you imagine that world, you imagined this world. Well, these are all real examples of things that have been done on Google Cloud platform. The first is a real family of cucumber farmers. The second is a Japanese manufacturer of high-quality baby food product, Kewpie; and the third is HSBC who uses Google Cloud to run a better business and catch the bad guys across 27 million customers. Pretty different chefs, completely different applications, why is Google Cloud platform the right choice for all of them? Well, think about what you might want in a kitchen. You'd want good engineering so you probably want to think about getting a partner whose quality you trust. But think more long term than that. If you believe in your own infinite creativity, if you believe in the future, you would be crazy to let yourself get locked into a kitchen where the [indiscernible] sets it one time for you and then controls what you can and can't have in there. And every appliance has its own proprietary little socket that you are not allowed to tamper with. And if your business changes, then you have to rebuild and beware the whole thing. Imagine instead the dream kitchen that becomes what you needed to be instantly. Complete universal wiring, open interfaces, the best of everything, all the modern appliances always available, and you can plug them in with no fuss because that wiring is universal. That, my friends, is the power of open source, and that is what Google and Red Hat, together believe in. We don't want to see your creativity squashed by what seemed like a good idea yesterday. So we have built for you an incredible, future-proof machine learning kitchen. This kitchen can expand, contract as you need it. You can plug in whatever you like, all the most modern appliances are there and compatible as you need them, fully customizable. Because none of us can tell what innovations the future will bring, and we don't want you to have to bet on the direction of progress and lock yourselves in. We want you to be free to be as creative as all of us can be together. So I hope that you're excited to dive in. This machine learning kitchen is there ready waiting for you to get started, start playing in it. Your machine learning adventure awaits. Thanks so much.\nAttendees: Now if there's a company that understands these changes, including machine learning and big data as well as open source and collaboration, it's Google.

So please welcome Ritch from Kohl's and Cassie from Google.\nAttendees: All right. Most of you know Kohl's as a chain of leading American department stores, but you might not know that they've also been a long-time customer of Red Hat. Ritch, could you tell us a little bit about Kohl's and your relationship with us?\nAttendees: Sure thing. So first of all, it's great to be here. I was really looking forward to summit this year, and then I saw Weezer was playing, and that put me right over the top, icing on the cake, so looking forward to that. So Kohl's, we're a department store, almost 1,200 stores, 49 states, about $19 billion in revenue. We've got about a 1,000-person IT shop, another 2,500 people in managed services around the globe, so big, big technology footprint. We're based in Wisconsin outside Milwaukee, but we also have a tech center here in Silicon Valley, in Milpitas. So long time Red Hat customer. When I got to Kohl's about 8 years ago, there was a small pocket in the data center running RHEL. And it was a distant third out of 3 operating systems at Kohl's. And I look today years later, RHEL is the predominant operating system and we've just signed on for OpenShift as our PaaS platform and our hybrid cloud effort. We have efforts underway around Gluster, ActiveMQ. We have a relentless automation effort, Ansible plays a big part there. So we are very excited about our future with Red Hat. We've had a good history, the future looks even brighter. It's a big part of our digital transformation.\nExecutives: So we at Google are thrilled to be in this journey with you. Can you tell us a little bit more about why you picked Google as a partner?\nAttendees: Yes. So as we embarked on our hybrid cloud journey, we felt it was important to pick a primary public cloud provider. One cloud provider -- even though multi-cloud's inevitable, we felt 1 primary was the right approach where you would go very deep and understand that platform, all the nuances, how to optimize your workloads to run cost-effectively, how to use networking, all the details and we chose Google, and there's really a few reasons for that. One is we're an existing customer. We use G Suite, Ads, but more importantly, there were a few things. One, engineering. We think Google's engineering is really top-notch. And as we did our reference calls, time and time again we heard that not only is the engineering great, but you have access to the engineering resources. So we felt that was really important. Two, Google, it was really interesting. They said, \"hey, yes, this [ GCPDL ] is great, I appreciate that, but what do you want to do together? Like, what problems do you want to solve and retail?\" And we found that pretty interesting but I think lastly, the tiebreaker, a lot of great cloud offerings out there, was machine learning. We believe that, like all of you probably, that that's the next big unlock in our industry. And we felt that really Google is really the leader in that space and that's where we wanted to hit our wagon.\nExecutives: That's a topic really close to my heart, and I'm so glad that you've chosen us. Thank you.\nAttendees: So Ritch, you've been moving really quickly and even ahead of many of your peers. So it sounds like Red Hat and Google have both played a role in that. What do we offer both -- what do we both offer together that you don't get elsewhere?\nAttendees: Sure. So I would say that as I've gone through my career, one of the things I've gotten a much greater appreciation for is the value of partnerships. I would say earlier in my career, I didn't probably spend a lot of energy on that. But having gone through really good partnerships and other partnerships that weren't so good, it can take years, if not a decade, to unwind from some of those decisions that you make, right? So I think the secret is this: the secret is to understand what your values are as a company and then go find partners that align to those values, okay? So with us, it's pretty simple. We're a very engineering-led organization and we feel that you guys both align really nicely to that. Secondly, we're very committed to a future of open source, okay? Not only just open source, but enterprise-grade open source, right, that we can run our business on. So we felt that with the future being so uncertain, you don't know where all this is going 5 years from now, so what you need to do is find a partner that has the right stuff in their DNA so that as new products are announced and new acquisitions are made, you know they're going to continue on that path of engineering-centric and a commitment to open source. So to us, that's really what it's about and that's why we're thrilled to partner with these 2 companies and looking forward to a great future.\nAttendees: Well, thanks a lot. I love hearing the kind of open source collaboration is what really brings this partnership to the forefront. So we'll turn it over to Cassie. Thank you.\nExecutives: So how many of you had that moment where you realize everyone is using some word and you have no idea what that means but you're too afraid to ask at this point? What even is machine learning? Well, it's an approach to making lots of small decisions with data, something involving algorithmically finding patterns in data, but let me just put it bluntly so that we can all get it. It's a thing labeler essentially, that's what machine learning is. It's just a thing labeler. So why on earth should you be excited about thing labeling? Well, here's my pet Huxley, and you've just taken in some pretty complicated data through your senses and you just know that that's a cat. And if I show you a different image, you're not fooled, you still know that, that label is cat. Your brain just does this, you don't even know how your brain does it. Now, if we want to get a computer to perform this labeling task for us, if we went the traditional way, you know this, programmers, we would communicate with the universe in some way, think really deeply about the problem and come up with a model. It's a model, it's just a recipe, it's a set of instructions that a computer has to follow to get from the image to the label. And we would have to hand craft that. Now, think about what this recipe would have to be for the computer to correctly detect that there's a cat in the image. I mean, think about what you, your brain actually did with those pixels. Can you express that? Do you know what your brain is doing? Or have you just had the benefit of eons of evolution and it just kind of figures it out for you? Now, that recipe is really hard to handcraft. Wouldn't it be better if you could just say to the machine: here, look at a bunch of examples of cats, look at a bunch of examples of not cats and just figure it out yourself. That is what machine learning is all about. It is a completely different programming paradigm. Now instead of giving explicit instructions, you program with examples, with data and let that machine learning algorithm figure it out and stitch that code that goes in between for you. So why should you actually be excited by this thing labeling? Well, engineers, you know we like to get computers to do stuff for us and there's a whole class of tasks where we just cannot express the instructions, they're ineffable. AI and machine learning are about automating the ineffable. This is a fundamental leap in human progress. Now you can get computers to do tasks where you cannot possibly express the instructions. This is so exciting and seems futuristic and difficult, right? And when you think about machine learning, the one thing I most want you to think about is microwaves. Who here in the audience knows how a microwave oven works well enough to build a new one from scratch? Raise hands. Who can build a new one? Do I see any takers, any takers? No hands? Yes, me neither. Who here has never used one to reheat food? You all have. Even though you have no idea how it works, you're still happy to use one, right? And anyone here feel like you would have no idea how to get hold of one, I don't know, like maybe add Kohl's, if you needed one? Now, you just told me you have no idea how it works so how could you possibly trust this microwave? Well, you're not going to trust it by reading the wiring diagram, are you? You're going to trust it by taking that it actually does work, by having a good idea of what you want it to do for you and then tasting what comes out on the other side. And that is exactly what you'll do with machine learning, and this is a perfect analogy for machine learning. Now what they don't tell you about machine learning, when we use that term, there's actually 2 machine learnings, not 1. Two completely different disciplines that are as different as building microwaves from scratch and innovating in the kitchen. And you need completely different skill sets for these. If you want to be a machine learning researcher, you are building general-purpose tools for other people to use. And so the bad news there is that there is quite a lot of education that you need to get, it takes a little while to ramp up because how on earth are you going to build a better microwave than the one that exists already, there's some pretty sophisticated stuff out there, if you have no idea how the current one works? So that's the bad news, it takes a long time to become a machine learning researcher. The good news though is that if that is your cup of tea, we at Google have a large machine learning research shop where we make these tools for you that are all powered by open source. So we give you those wiring diagrams as a springboard so that you can go and build a better microwave than what we have, using our blueprints. And TensorFlow, a really popular machine learning project, started at Google before we open sourced it because we believe that the community as a whole so much more innovative than just any one of us alone. But let's face it, most of you are not here to build general-purpose microwaves. You just want to get cooking already, right? You just want to use these things to solve business problems, and so you are in the completely other discipline, applied machine learning. Now for that, you do not need a PhD. You don't need to know how back propagation works and neural networks any more than a chef needs to know how a microwave is wired. Instead, what you need is a really good kitchen to play in. And we at Google, provide that for you. Let me show you some of the things that we have. And what you're going to need kind of depends on what you're cooking. If you're cooking with usual ingredients, data, and you're making usual dishes, labels, predictions. So say you're making pizza, please don't go reinvent the concept of pizza from scratch. There's already recipes out there and you can just grab those recipes and start making pizza, and that is what our cloud APIs are all about. These are recipes that we've already built that you can just pick up and start using. You can just plug them into your apps to make those intelligent applications. But say you're cooking with a little twist. Now, it's gluten-free, vegan pizza. Well, you still don't need to -- you still don't need to start entirely from scratch, it's still pizza. You can just adjust what already exists out there. And so what we suggest for you here is try cloud AutoML. Sure, maybe we haven't trained our vision system on the clothing type that your Kohl's customers are wearing, but no problem, just feed in your images with your labels into cloud AutoML, and you'll be good to go, only a small adjustment necessary. Now say you're truly innovating, you have your own completely unique ingredients, you're doing something pretty different in the kitchen. I don't know, maybe now you're making an edible sock that tastes like pizza. Well, machine learning and innovation are in Google's core DNA. In fact, I can't think of a single one of our consumer products that doesn't have machine learning in it somewhere. And so if you are innovating in the kitchen, if you're building truly new recipes, what we have for you is cloud machine learning engine. This is access to exactly the same infrastructure that Google uses to train our models, incredible. So you could, if you wanted to, after this session, grab a laptop, open it up and test drive our shiny, gleaming kitchen with all those appliances ready to go, and you could feel the thrill of a data center and all this cutting-edge algorithms rising up to do your bidding. So solving business problems with machine learning, applied machine learning is far easier than what most people think. But you don't realize this that all those courses in university, those are all about how to build the microwave, not how to just use it to get cooking. And when I hear people say \"oh, I couldn't possibly get started with machine learning until I take a course in it or, goodness, a whole degree,\" I couldn't help but imagine that same person saying \"I couldn't possibly use a microwave until I've built one myself.\" You can just get cooking. It's not the lack of degree or course or knowledge that's holding you back. What's much, much more important than that, what you need to get started is creativity. Figure out what you're going to cook because all those tools are already there waiting for you to use them. Imagine gleaming kitchens just waiting for you to come play in them. But since this is a thing labeler, you need to start by thinking what on earth do you want labeled and see how creative you can get with that. You might imagine the label being maybe the wave form that sounds like a voice that could make a hairdresser's appointment for you. Or you can imagine a few other cases like maybe you are a loving son and your aging parents sort vegetables by hand and you want to save them the trouble of having to do that on their farm. So maybe, you're thinking about building a system that will label the vegetables and sort it automatically so your parents don't have to do it. Or maybe you're worried about the ingredients that go into baby food and you think it would be great if you could automatically check whether the ingredient is safe or spoiled before it goes in. Or maybe you're into the idea of a huge bank with trillions of dollars in assets, countering fraud and money laundering automatically across millions of accounts. If you imagine that world, you imagined this world. Well, these are all real examples of things that have been done on Google Cloud platform. The first is a real family of cucumber farmers; the second is a Japanese manufacturer of high-quality baby food products, Kewpie; and the third is HSBC who uses Google Cloud to run a better business and catch the bad guys across 27 million customers. Pretty different chefs, completely different applications. Why is Google Cloud platform the right choice for all of them? Well, think about what you might want in a kitchen. You'd want good engineering so you probably want to think about getting a partner whose quality you trust. But think more long term than that. If you believe in your own infinite creativity, if you believe in the future, you would be crazy to let yourself get locked into a kitchen where the purveyor sets it up one time for you and then controls what you can and can't have in there, and every appliance has its own proprietary little socket that you are not allowed to tamper with. And if your business changes, then you have to rebuild and rewire the whole thing. Imagine instead, the dream kitchen that becomes what you need it to be instantly. Complete universal wiring, open interfaces, the best of everything, all the modern appliances always available, and you can plug them in with no fuss because that wiring is universal. That, my friends, is the power of open source, and that is what Google and Red Hat together believe in. We don't want to see your creativity squashed by what seemed like a good idea yesterday. So we have built for you an incredible, future-proof machine learning kitchen. This kitchen can expand, contract as you need it. You can plug in whatever you like, all the most modern appliances are there and compatible as you need them, fully customizable. Because none of us can tell what innovations the future will bring, and we don't want you to have to bet on the direction of progress and lock yourselves in. We want you to be free to be as creative as all of us can be together. So I hope that you're excited to dive in. This machine learning kitchen is there, ready, waiting for you to get started, start playing in it. Your machine learning adventure awaits. Thanks so much.\nAttendees: Now, if there's a company that understands these changes, including machine learning and big data as well as open source and collaboration, it's Google.

But before she gives you more information about what intelligent apps will really look like, we'll hear from a shared customer, Kohl's, about their journey with Red Hat and Google. \nSo please welcome Ritch from Kohl's and Cassie from Google.\nAttendees: All right. Most of you know Kohl's as a chain of leading American department stores, but you might not know that they've also been a long-time customer of Red Hat. Ritch, could you tell us a little bit about Kohl's and your relationship with us?\nAttendees: Sure thing. So first of all, it's great to be here. I was really looking forward to summit this year, and then I saw Weezer was playing, and that put me right over the top, icing on the cake, so looking forward to that. So Kohl's, we're a department store, almost 1,200 stores, 49 states, about $19 billion in revenue. We've got about a 1,000-person IT shop, another 2,500 people in managed services around the globe, so big, big technology footprint. We're based in Wisconsin outside Milwaukee, but we also have a tech center here in Silicon Valley, in Milpitas. So long time Red Hat customer. When I got to Kohl's about 8 years ago, there was a small pocket in the data center running RHEL. And it was a distant third out of 3 operating systems at Kohl's. And I look today years later, RHEL is the predominant operating system and we've just signed on for OpenShift as our PaaS platform in our hybrid cloud effort. We have efforts underway around Gluster, ActiveMQ. We have a relentless automation effort, Ansible plays a big part there. So we are very excited about our future with Red Hat. We've had a good history. The future looks even brighter. It's a big part of our digital transformation.\nExecutives: So we at Google are thrilled to be on this journey with you. Can you tell us a little bit more about why you picked Google as a partner?\nAttendees: Yes. So as we embarked on our hybrid cloud journey, we felt it was important to pick a primary public cloud provider. One cloud provider -- even though multi-cloud is inevitable, we felt one primary was the right approach where you would go very deep and understand that platform, all the nuances, how to optimize your workloads to run cost-effectively, how to use networking, all the details and we chose Google, and there's really a few reasons for that. One is we're an existing customer. We use G Suite, Ads, but more importantly, there were a few things. One, engineering. We think Google's engineering is really top-notch. And as we did our reference calls, time and time again we heard that not only is the engineering great, but you have access to the engineering resources. So we felt that was really important. Two, Google, it was really interesting. They said, \"Hey, yes, those GCP deals are great.\" I appreciate that, but what do you want to do together? Like, what problems do you want to solve in retail? And we found that pretty interesting but I think lastly, the tiebreaker, a lot of great cloud offerings out there, was machine learning. We believe that, like all of you probably, that that's the next big unlock in our industry. And we felt that Google was really the leader in that space and that's where we wanted to hit our wagon.\nExecutives: That's a topic really close to my heart, and I'm so glad that you've chosen us. Thank you.\nAttendees: So Ritch, you've been moving really quickly and even ahead of many of your peers. So it sounds like Red Hat and Google have both played a role in that. What do we offer both -- what do we both offer together that you don't get elsewhere?\nAttendees: Sure. So I would say that as I've gone through my career, one of the things I've gotten a much greater appreciation for is the value of partnerships. I would say earlier in my career, I didn't probably spend a lot of energy on that. But having gone through really good partnerships and other partnerships that weren't so good, it can take years, if not a decade, to unwind from some of those decisions that you make, right? So I think the secret is this: the secret is to understand what your values are as a company and then go find partners that align to those values, okay? So with us, it's pretty simple. We're a very engineering-led organization and we feel that you guys both align really nicely to that. Secondly, we're very committed to a future of open source, okay? Not only just open source, but enterprise-grade open source, right, that we can run our business on. So we felt that with the future being so uncertain, you don't know where all this is going 5 years from now, so what you need to do is find a partner that has the right stuff in their DNA so that as new products are announced and new acquisitions are made, you know they're going to continue on that path of engineering-centric and a commitment to open source. So to us, that's really what it's about and that's why we're thrilled to partner with these 2 companies and looking forward to a great future.\nAttendees: Well, thanks a lot. I love hearing the kind of open source collaboration is what really brings this partnership to the forefront. So we'll turn it over to Cassie. Thank you.\nExecutives: So how many of you had that moment where you realize everyone is using some word and you have no idea what that means but you're too afraid to ask at this point? What even is machine learning? Well, it's an approach to making lots of small decisions with data, something involving algorithmically finding patterns in data, but let me just put it bluntly so that we can all get it. \nIt's a thing labeler essentially, that's what machine learning is. It's just a thing labeler. So why on earth should you be excited about thing labeling? Well, here's my pet Huxley, and you've just taken in some pretty complicated data through your senses and you just know that that's a cat. And if I show you a different image, you're not fooled, you still know that, that label is cat. Your brain just does this, you don't even know how your brain does it. Now, if we want to get a computer to perform this labeling task for us, if we went the traditional way, you know this, programmers, we would communicate with the universe in some way, think really deeply about the problem and come up with a model. It's a model, it's just a recipe, it's a set of instructions that a computer has to follow to get from the image to the label. And we would have to hand craft that. Now, think about what this recipe would have to be for the computer to correctly detect that there's a cat in the image. I mean, think about what you, your brain actually did with those pixels. Can you express that? Do you know what your brain is doing? Or have you just had the benefit of eons of evolution and it just kind of figures it out for you? Now, that recipe is really hard to handcraft. Wouldn't it be better if you could just say to the machine: here, look at a bunch of examples of cats, look at a bunch of examples of not cats and just figure it out yourself. That is what machine learning is all about. It is a completely different programming paradigm. Now instead of giving explicit instructions, you program with examples, with data and let that machine learning algorithm figure it out and stitch that code that goes in between for you. So why should you actually be excited by this thing labeling? \nWell, engineers, you know we like to get computers to do stuff for us and there's a whole class of tasks where we just cannot express the instructions, they're ineffable. AI and machine learning are about automating the ineffable. This is a fundamental leap in human progress. Now you can get computers to do tasks where you cannot possibly express the instructions. This is so exciting and seems futuristic and difficult, right? And when you think about machine learning, the one thing I most want you to think about is microwaves. Who here in the audience knows how a microwave oven works well enough to build a new one from scratch? Raise hands. Who can build a new one? Do I see any takers, any takers? No hands? Yes, me neither. Who here has never used one to reheat food? You all have. Even though you have no idea how it works, you're still happy to use one, right? And anyone here feel like you would have no idea how to get hold of one, I don't know, like maybe add Kohl's, if you needed one? Now, you just told me you have no idea how it works so how could you possibly trust this microwave? Well, you're not going to trust it by reading the wiring diagram, are you? You're going to trust it by taking that it actually does work, by having a good idea of what you want it to do for you and then tasting what comes out on the other side. And that is exactly what you'll do with machine learning, and this is a perfect analogy for machine learning. Now what they don't tell you about machine learning, when we use that term, it's actually 2 machine learnings, not 1. Two completely different disciplines that are as different as building microwaves from scratch and innovating in the kitchen. And you need completely different skill sets for these. If you want to be a machine learning researcher, you are building general-purpose tools for other people to use. And so the bad news there is that there is quite a lot of education that you need to get, it takes a little while to ramp up because how on earth are you going to build a better microwave than the one that exists already, there's some pretty sophisticated stuff out there, if you have no idea how the current one works? So that's the bad news, it takes a long time to become a machine learning researcher. The good news though is that if that is your cup of tea, we at Google have a large machine learning research shop where we make these tools for you that are all powered by open source. So we give you those wiring diagrams as a springboard so that you can go and build a better microwave than what we have, using our blueprints. And TensorFlow, a really popular machine learning project, started at Google before we open sourced it because we believe that the community as a whole so much more innovative than just any one of us alone. But let's face it, most of you are not here to build general-purpose microwaves. You just want to get cooking already, right? You just want to use these things to solve business problems, and so you are in the completely other discipline, applied machine learning. Now for that, you do not need a PhD. You don't need to know how back propagation works and neural networks any more than a chef needs to know how a microwave is wired. Instead, what you need is a really good kitchen to play in. And we at Google, provide that for you. Let me show you some of the things that we have. And what you're going to need kind of depends on what you're cooking. If you're cooking with usual ingredients, data, and you're making usual dishes, labels, predictions. So say you're making pizza, please don't go reinvent the concept of pizza from scratch. There's already recipes out there and you can just grab those recipes and start making pizza, and that is what our cloud APIs are all about. These are recipes that we've already built that you can just pick up and start using. You can just plug them into your apps to make those intelligent applications. But say you're cooking with a little twist. Now, it's gluten-free, vegan pizza. Well, you still don't need to -- you still don't need to start entirely from scratch, it's still pizza. You can just adjust what already exists out there. And so what we suggest for you here is try cloud AutoML. Sure, maybe we haven't trained our vision system on the clothing type that your Kohl's customers are wearing, but no problem, just feed in your images with your labels into cloud AutoML, and you'll be good to go, only a small adjustment necessary. Now say you're truly innovating, you have your own completely unique ingredients, you're doing something pretty different in the kitchen. I don't know, maybe now you're making an edible sock that tastes like pizza. Well, machine learning and innovation are in Google's core DNA. In fact, I can't think of a single one of our consumer products that doesn't have machine learning in it somewhere. And so if you are innovating in the kitchen, if you're building truly new recipes, what we have for you is cloud machine learning engine. This is access to exactly the same infrastructure that Google uses to train our models, incredible. So you could, if you wanted to, after this session, grab a laptop, open it up and test drive our shiny, gleaming kitchen with all those appliances ready to go, and you could feel the thrill of a data center and all this cutting-edge algorithms rising up to do your bidding. So solving business problems with machine learning, applied machine learning is far easier than what most people think. But you don't realize this that all those courses in university, those are all about how to build the microwave, not how to just use it to get cooking. \nAnd when I hear people say \"Oh, I couldn't possibly get started with machine learning until I take a course in it or, goodness, a whole degree,\" I couldn't help but imagine that same person saying \"I couldn't possibly use a microwave until I've built one myself.\" You can just get cooking. It's not the lack of degree or course or knowledge that's holding you back. What's much, much more important than that, what you need to get started is creativity. Figure out what you're going to cook because all those tools are already there waiting for you to use them. Imagine gleaming kitchens just waiting for you to come play in them. But since this is a thing labeler, you need to start by thinking what on earth do you want labeled and see how creative you can get with that. You might imagine the label being maybe the wave form that sounds like a voice that could make a hairdresser's appointment for you. Or you can imagine a few other cases like maybe you are a loving son and your aging parents sort vegetables by hand and you want to save them the trouble of having to do that on their farm. So maybe, you're thinking about building a system that will label the vegetables and sort it automatically so your parents don't have to do it. Or maybe you're worried about the ingredients that go into baby food and you think it would be great if you could automatically check whether the ingredient is safe or spoiled before it goes in. Or maybe you're into the idea of a huge bank with trillions of dollars in assets, countering fraud and money laundering automatically across millions of accounts. If you imagine that world, you imagined this world. Well, these are all real examples of things that have been done on Google Cloud platform. The first is a real family of cucumber farmers; the second is a Japanese manufacturer of high-quality baby food products, Kewpie; and the third is HSBC who uses Google Cloud to run a better business and catch the bad guys across 27 million customers. Pretty different chefs, completely different applications. Why is Google Cloud platform the right choice for all of them? Well, think about what you might want in a kitchen. You'd want good engineering so you probably want to think about getting a partner whose quality you trust. But think more long term than that. If you believe in your own infinite creativity, if you believe in the future, you would be crazy to let yourself get locked into a kitchen where the purveyor sets it up one time for you and then controls what you can and can't have in there, and every appliance has its own proprietary little socket that you are not allowed to tamper with. And if your business changes, then you have to rebuild and rewire the whole thing. Imagine instead, the dream kitchen that becomes what you need it to be instantly. Complete universal wiring, open interfaces, the best of everything, all the modern appliances always available, and you can plug them in with no fuss because that wiring is universal.\nThat, my friends, is the power of open source, and that is what Google and Red Hat together believe in. We don't want to see your creativity squashed by what seemed like a good idea yesterday. So we have built for you an incredible, future-proof machine learning kitchen. This kitchen can expand, contract as you need it. You can plug in whatever you like, all the most modern appliances are there and compatible as you need them, fully customizable. Because none of us can tell what innovations the future will bring, and we don't want you to have to bet on the direction of progress and lock yourselves in. We want you to be free to be as creative as all of us can be together. So I hope that you're excited to dive in. \nThis machine learning kitchen is there, ready, waiting for you to get started, start playing in it. Your machine learning adventure awaits. Thanks so much.",

         "Google LLC, Squarespace, Inc. - M&A Call",
         "Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Sara, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Squarespace's conference call to discuss their definitive agreement to acquire Google Domains assets. [Operator Instructions]\nI will now hand the call over to your host at Squarespace, Clare Perry. Clare, please go ahead.\nExecutives: Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on short notice. As you've seen this afternoon, we've announced Squarespace's proposed acquisition of Google's Domain assets. I'm Clare Perry, Head of Investor Relations. Joining us today to discuss the transaction is Anthony Casalena, Squarespace Founder and CEO. Nathan Gooden, CFO, is on the line as well. Please note that we will not be commenting on our second quarter 2023 or expected full year 2023 guidance during today's call. We expect to provide additional disclosure at our Q2 2023 earnings call. \nWe'd like to remind you that during the course of this conference call, management will make forward-looking statements, including statements regarding the demand and market opportunity for our products and subscriptions, including our beliefs about the anticipated benefits of the proposed acquisition of Google Domains assets for us and Google Domain customers as well as forward-looking statements regarding the anticipated timing of close and our migration and integration plan and our continued execution and focus on providing more value to our customers. \nAlso statements other than historical facts, including our beliefs about the anticipated benefits, our continued execution and focus and the expected benefits of the proposed transaction, are forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current expectations, assumptions, estimates and beliefs. \nWhile we believe these expectations, assumptions, estimates and beliefs are reasonable, such forward-looking statements are only predictions and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties which are beyond our control and which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these statements. These forward-looking statements apply as of today, and one should not rely on them as representing our views in the future. \nToday's call is being recorded, and all participants are currently in listen-only mode. Following brief prepared remarks, we'll open up the call to your questions. With that, I'll turn over the call to Anthony.\nExecutives: Thank you, Clare. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. I'm thrilled to be able to share more about our proposed acquisition of the Google Domains asset. This acquisition offers an unprecedented opportunity to significantly expand our existing domains business and offer our website building tools and other services to millions of additional customers. We're proud to have been chosen as the custodian for these millions of customers and are excited to be working with Google on this critical piece of Internet architecture. Under the terms of this acquisition, approximately 10 million domain names currently managed by Google will be moved to be managed by Squarespace. \nSquarespace's expansive suite of products for entrepreneurs range from websites, e-commerce and marketing tools as well as tools for scheduling with Acuity, creating and managing social media presence with Bio Sites and Unfold and hospitality business management via Tock. Domains are a critical part of web infrastructure and a starting point for many people's journey to establish their online presence. Today, domains are the highest attached product to our core website offering, and we've been investing in our domains business for nearly a decade. \nExisting Google Domains customers will be onboarded to Squarespace's core domains platform, which we've already been investing in for a decade. Squarespace offers some of the most comprehensive domain registration tools in the industry, all embedded within our integrated platform. Throughout the transition period, both Squarespace and Google will remain focused on ensuring a seamless migration for our customers. We will be leveraging existing Google Domains infrastructure to ensure that this process results in no disruption. \nUnder the terms of our agreement, we will honor all existing Google Domains customers' domain renewal prices for at least 12 months following the closing of this transaction. In addition, we'll be providing exclusive incentives to Google Domains customers who wish to adopt any of Squarespace's services moving forward. We do expect to see some degree of natural churn during this transition period as some Google Domains customers may no longer have a need for the domain while some may seek out another solution. \nSquarespace has been a long-time reseller of Google Workspace, and this deal expands and strengthens this partnership. For a period of at least 3 years upon closing, Squarespace will become the exclusive domain provider for any customer purchasing a domain along with our Workspace subscription from Google. \nSome details related to the transaction. Under the terms of the agreement, the purchase price of $180 million is financed through cash on hand and an extension of our existing credit facility. Further details are available in the 8-K we filed earlier today. We expect the transition to close in Q3 2023, subject to the satisfaction of certain regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. We believe this transaction will be meaningfully accretive to our top line and cash flow. And we will see immediate -- and while we will see immediate economic gains after we close this transaction, the majority of the benefits that will be realized in years 2024 and beyond. Additional disclosures about the financial impact of this deal will appear in future financial updates. \nI'd like to again thank Google for believing in us as a partner, and I look forward to what I believe will be a fruitful deal for both of our companies and our customers. With that, let's open the line to your questions.\nOperator: Our first question comes from Trevor Young with Barclays.\nAnalysts: Great. Two, if I may. First, on the 10 million domain installed base that you're getting. Are all of those customers currently at that $12 a year pricing? Or are some of those domains maybe at lower pricing or even free for some of the existing Google customers as part of like some broader promotion and that sort of thing? \nAnd then second one, Anthony, historically, the few acquisitions you've done before were to get some interesting tech, maybe some talent or just features that are a bit differentiated from peers like Tock and Unfold. Domains is maybe a little bit more vanilla and commodity. So just help us think through what's the opportunity that you're playing for here? And what can -- how can you be differentiated on Domains?\nExecutives: Sure. So to your first question around price, I think you're citing what I believe is the lowest of the price is around $12 a year for dotcoms. And I believe they go up from there, depending on TLD. To my knowledge, there are no domains given for free, mostly because, I mean, domains have an underlying cost with Verisign if it's a dotcom. So I don't believe there's any other subsidies or whatnot being given. So all the domains are paid. \nAnd secondarily, I mean, in terms of the opportunity, this is just incredible for us. By the way, it's -- up to 10 million domains could transfer, some could transfer away, et cetera, et cetera. I think we're the best place for these domains, especially considering the landscape of options. But I mean, of these 10 million domains, this is like our lifeblood. These are starting points for websites. They're starting points for entrepreneurs. So we're just so excited to be expanding our business this significantly and also this deeper partnership with Google so that we can be in front of a whole new cohort of new customers with their starting point. \nSo it's a really unique opportunity for us. I have referred to it as maybe bumps in the lifetime. And certainly not in the vein of anything we've done in the past, but we've never seen something like this in the past. And frankly, I doubt we'll ever see something like it again.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ken Wong with Oppenheimer.\nAnalysts: Great. Fantastic. A super interesting acquisition here, Anthony. I was just wondering, can you give us any sense of what the annual domain additions from the Google Domain business might look like as we think about what that potential new customer funnel could potentially be?\nExecutives: So there's a lot of publicly available information on domains and their growth rate for various registrars, which I'm sure you will look up. We won't be providing anything additionally at this time. But there's a multitude of opportunities here. We've got the domains that will be coming in. We'll be -- the underlying reseller agreement we have with Google now, which we'll be providing back-end services for the domains. And then just the ones that are, of course, transferring over as part of the overall agreement. So this represents a really interesting shift in the industry, and I'm just really happy with how we're positioned here.\nAnalysts: Got it. And then as far as just the domain business, natural, there is a good attach on to kind of the core website. Just wondering, as far as registrar, is Squarespace a registrar? Or do you currently utilize a partner on the domain side of things?\nExecutives: We are currently a registrar, and we manage -- we use that registrar to manage some of the most popular TLDs that are on the platform, com, net and org, things like that, which gives us advantageous positioning in terms of our margins. Both Squarespace and Google do rely -- Google Domains currently do rely on a number of other partners to do the long tail of TLD registrations, especially ccTLDs. So we'll continue to move more domains just based on demand into our registrar, but the -- everyone relies on partners to get that 400th domain TLD into the platform.\nAnalysts: Got it. And if I could just maybe sneak a quick one. Just margins -- should we think of this business as having comparable margin profile to the website business? And any color there?\nExecutives: Well, our current domains business doesn't have comparable margins to the website business, right? We manage millions of domains right now. I think over time, there's an ability to improve margin here and there's a lot of tests we can do and other things. But this is not like a loss leader business for us. So -- nor is it for any of the other large companies that sell domains right now.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris  Zhang with Credit Suisse.\nAnalysts: So I have 2 questions. The first one, on the exclusivity part, just wondering about the mechanics. So historically, we think of the need for Google Workspace arising from somebody already using a web builder, for example, Squarespace, and then they decide to use, add a Google Workspace. But to the extent that Google Workspace can serve as kind of a funnel for new customers to Squarespace, historically, what's that like? So what's the kind of percentage of the new customers that typically come from someone that wants to use a Google Workspace and then discovers that we can use Google Workspace, Google Domains. And then from there, since it's -- since they're able to use Squarespace and then add Squarespace, can you give any thoughts on that? And I have a follow-up on the mechanics.\nExecutives: Sure. If I understand the question, I mean, look, there's a lot of ways people go about establishing the core things they need to be -- need to be online. I'd say those core things are a domain and e-mail address and a website. And so at Squarespace, sometimes they're starting with the website. Sometimes they're starting with the domain. We support both those paths. And also conversely, Google, sometimes people are starting with Workspace and then they want the domain or the website. \nAnd so the mechanics of it work like this. If you are in Workspace and you're signing up for a domain, they will use an API call behind the scenes to register that domain with Squarespace using our infrastructure as the registrar. But that domain and that front-end customer experience will still be managed by Google. Now we do have -- advantageous to -- we're in a great spot to also sell them a website later, but that's kind of how those mechanics work.\nAnalysts: Got it. That's super helpful. And I think to the extent you can convert additional customers on the domain to Squarespace, what would you think of the percentage that are out of the 10 million domain users? For example, I'd imagine it's probably going to be a little harder for somebody that's already using a competitor's solution just because of the way to like rebuild the website? Or is there going to be any solution to make them -- to convert to Squarespace easier?\nExecutives: We, of course, have our internal models of why we were confident in doing this deal. I'd say that what we're going to be doing over the next couple of months as we -- the first and foremost thing we're focused on is just business continuity and making sure this is smooth for everybody and that we're doing this and there's no disruptions. \nAnd then after that, and I spoke about it earlier and I alluded to it in the press release, there's a lot of opportunities for us to say, hey, where -- you're a new customer of Squarespace, what can we do for you that's kind of an outsized incentive to use Squarespace's products if that's something you want to use? \nI mean there's plenty of people who use Squarespace and only have the domains with us. That's not a rare use case. So I just think it's just great positioning, and I'm super excited about the partnership.\nAnalysts: All right. Anthony, congrats on the transaction.\nExecutives: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Ygal Arounian with Citi.\nAnalysts: Just a follow-up on that last question first. Do you have any sense of how many customers are -- how  many Google Domain customers are currently using Squarespace to build their website? Is that what you're referring to with your internal models? And I have a follow-up.\nExecutives: Yes, we're not really seeing any breakdowns of kind of the services that people are using right now. Yes, it's all across the board.\nAnalysts: Okay. Great. And then I just wanted to maybe hear a little bit more about how you think about domains as kind of a top-of-funnel marketing tool. As we think about how people start their journey, so you talked about the core things that people need to establish to be online. I see some real marketing efficiency over the past couple of quarters. Is this a tool where you could see kind of increased marketing efficiency around -- it's a lower price point just to start a domain versus to start a website? How do you think about that opportunity?\nExecutives: Well, it represents a giant marketing funnel for us. I mean we have millions of domains under management just because of the opportunity to have up to 10 million more without the ongoing synergies that will cause even more people to go kind of over to our platform. And it's going to help us, of course, sell Squarespace services into these millions of domains and millions of customers. So that's kind of really positive for us moving forward. \nLook, just in terms of like the importance of domains, people, a lot of times -- and these are just the 2 flows that we provide on the front of Squarespace right now. Some people want to start with the website. Some people have an idea. They buy a domain, they park it, and they build the website later. So it really just depends where you are and how you prefer to get started. \nBut I mean, right now, I think more than ever, just owning that piece of the Internet, that's the authoritative you, like just a domain is so inexpensive compared to what it is. I mean our price is $20 a year. And you own this piece of the Internet that you control what's on. It's authoritative. \nSo we don't really see the importance of this going away anytime soon. And in fact, as your online presence becomes more and more important, like this is your online real estate, it's critical. So it's why we've been investing in it for a decade. This is not a new business for us. So it's just such a great opportunity for us to be able to strengthen that business and really invest in the domains product further because it's such a critical part of our whole ecosystem.\nAnalysts: If I can ask also one quick follow-up. Is there anything you could share on this just in the conversations with Google during this -- why they were kind of interested in selling this asset, the rationale from their end. I don't know if there's anything you could share or not, but if there is, I'd be interested in that.\nExecutives: Yes. You'd have to reach out to them for commentary on their strategy. I'm mostly focused on why this was just a fantastic opportunity for us because it's just so critical to the website infrastructure. And again, we've been doing this for a decade, almost a decade. We've been a Google Workspace reseller for almost a decade. It's just a really natural fit for our -- in our world. So we're really excited.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Siti Panigrahi.\nAnalysts: I guess everybody is trying to understand that maybe the authoritative part of that comment you said because that's kind of a cross-sell opportunity is kind of what we see there because domain name kind of pretty slow growth, low single-digit kind of growth, domain name's kind of getting saturated, what I think the cross-sell opportunity you said. \nSo I guess I wanted to understand like anybody those who have a domain name had access to other -- all your competitors have access to them, they can reach out to that. So what -- is it the bundling part of it? You can bundle it, your domain name registration along with this, that's sort of attractive, I mean, for those who don't have a website? \nAnd second thing, those who have a website, what really drives someone to change their website and start building something on Squarespace? It's purely a displacement market. So what would trigger that to do it?\nExecutives: So what would trigger somebody to change their website? I mean it's the same kind of factors would kind of be the existing factors in addition to the fact that for us, during this, I mean, just a number of things to emphasize. We're maintaining price continuity. We are reutilizing existing infrastructure to ensure that this is seamless, right? \nSo if you wanted to change registrars right now, one, you have to pay the change because you have to renew your domain to transfer. And then two, you have to make sure all your settings are right so that it doesn't throw up your website or your e-mail and all that. So we're managing all that using existing infrastructure. \nAnd then on top of that -- and we haven't rolled out any of this out yet because we're just at the very beginning of this deal. We're going to be providing interesting incentives and opportunities to people who've moved over as part of this transition for some period of time to utilize Squarespace services. \nSo obviously, just like it is currently on our business, the upsell, cross-sell around the domain, just getting that trio of things attached to it, domain, e-mail, website is really important. And look, domains are not -- well, not the worst margins ever, they're not the highest margin stuff we do. Obviously, that's the website business. And so again, it's a business we've been in for a long time, and we're just excited to have the new opportunities in front of us and to expand it.\nAnalysts: That's a good color. And then do you have any number out of the 10 million, how many of this domain name don't have any websites at this point?\nExecutives: We have an idea, but we're not kind of breaking that down publicly right now.\nAnalysts: Okay. All right.\nExecutives: I mean part of the advantage of us kind of in this kind of process is that, again, this is a business we've had for 10 years. And so we have our own view on churn, pricing, cross-sell, upsell. And we're not treating these the exact same as the domain that would have come in through us, but we're not kind of operating blind here. We have our own infrastructure that runs domain. We support domains right now with our customer operations group. We support Google Workspace with our customer operations group. \nSo in that sense, it's sort of like, it's kind of ideal in a way because, again, we're buying assets here. We don't have to buy any IP. There's a salary change. We're not buying a bunch of head count. There's no infrastructure. I mean, we're utilizing Google's infrastructure, but we're not like -- it's not like buying a company, which, again, I think is very, very good in this transaction for us.\nOperator: The next question comes from Andrew Boone with JMP Securities.\nAnalysts: I wanted to go and ask about the scale of adding 10 million domains for Squarespace. What does that unlock operationally? Does that imply that you guys go after aftermarket? Does that imply anything else now that you guys have more scale?\nExecutives: Yes. So it's up to 10 million depending on what transfers and what doesn't. We think it will be -- we're confident that we're a really, really great home for Domain's customers. What I think about in terms of the future, maybe not going all the way into aftermarket yet but just really making sure that our domains product is the best in the world and that there is no reason why you would ever want to manage a domain anywhere else. \nIt's already very, very, very good. And this will just increase our investment there. But again, it's not like we have to double it, triple it because we've already put so much work into this. So I think it allows us to invest more, but we've always been very disciplined about kind of our headcount and our -- the initiatives that we're on and controlling our cost structure. So we get the thing that's great about this, and we mentioned in the press release, we think this is accretive to both the top and bottom line over time.\nAnalysts: And for my second question, can you just talk about the deal coming together? Was it competitive? How kind of -- how fast or how slow did it take? Just any other details you can share there.\nExecutives: I can't share a lot of details. Obviously, this is an opportunity that a lot of people would have really been very interested in. I think I'm very happy that we were able to partner with Google on this and strengthen the relationship. And I think it's just so great because, again, we've been doing this with Google for like a decade. And so it's a very natural thing for us to support Workspace, very -- I mean, we're huge resellers of Workspace. We support as a Workspace. I use Workspace personally all the time. Like, so it's -- this is more than just anyone who wanted it. Us and Google care so much about the customer experience during this and making sure that the customers have a good home, and that we are companies that share an ethos and customer service and just making sure we have a quality product. So there's a lot of factors that come into this deal that, again, I'm just very pleased and looking forward to supporting these customers, looking forward to working with Google in a closer fashion.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Aaron Kessler with Raymond James.\nAnalysts: A couple of questions. First, any details you can share in terms of maybe the demographics of the Google Domain customers? Are they similar to your current customer base? And second, I think on the Google Domains website, they're currently -- they currently recommend, I think, like 9, 10 website designers on their site. There's -- have them listed. Do you know if those will still stay the same? Or would that be replaced kind of as a primary shift to Squarespace as well?\nExecutives: Well, I can say that Squarespace will probably recommend Squarespace as the website designer of choice that we would prefer. So I think that one's -- we have a strong opinion there. Regarding the demographic, look, we did not go into this blind. We looked at -- we're not going to obviously show the breakdown of it publicly. \nBut we were able to look at this, look at how it overlap with ours, get confidence or not around which segments we were interested in. And we just found that there was a pretty positive fit here. And so, yes, a lot of that analysis and thinking went into our decision here.\nAnalysts: Got it. And so should we primarily be viewing this deal as kind of a lower-cost marketing funnel versus kind of bidding on traffic on various sites? Or is it much more strategic in nature in terms of the cross-selling abilities?\nExecutives: It's everything at once. It's really positive positioning for us. Obviously, the cross-sell and upsell opportunity here, but it's also accretive to the top and bottom line. So -- and there's the Workspace reseller opportunity. I mean there's a lot. \nAnd also, you mentioned this in the press release. We're going to be servicing a number of domains that are moving over that already are using Google Workspace, and we'll be providing the front-end and support for them as we've done for hundreds of thousands of customers already up to this point, maybe even millions. \nSo all those are kind of parts of this. So it's really a multidimensional thing. But it's not like this should be viewed as like, oh, we did it as a marketing spend. It's a positive business outcome for us as well. The same reason why we don't look at domains currently as a loss leader. It's an important part of the experience. We bundled it in with certain plans. We provide incentives around it, but it's a business for us, too.\nAnalysts: Great. Congrats.\nOperator: Our last question will come from Brad Erickson with RBC.\nAnalysts: Just 2 follow-ups. First, following up on Aaron's question, how would you see this kind of affecting your broader customer acquisition strategy? Obviously, it would seem like it makes it more efficient in general. But just curious how does the rest of your normal course customer acquisition strategy change as you build in this piece to the fold? And then I have a follow-up.\nExecutives: I'm not sure it's such a departure, right? Again, I feel like I'm repeating myself but, like, we've been in the domains business for a long time. We've done advertising related to domains. This is going to increase our investment there. I think that, that will mean that we're one of the best places to have a domain. \nAnd so yes, I think it's going to be really interesting for us. And then, of course, that unlocks the cross-sell, upsell stuff. As mentioned before, attached to a domain is one of the highest attach rates we have. As you might imagine, Squarespace live on domain. So yes, there's a lot of different aspects to this deal rolled into one, and that's what's so exciting about it. And you have a follow-up?\nAnalysts: Got it. Yes, just one last one. You mentioned in the press release, you were -- sort of used the word chosen, to kind of effectively win this acquisition. Just curious, maybe speak to how competitive this situation was? And further, just kind of does this have any implications as it pertains to any of your cloud relationships?\nExecutives: Yes. So the cloud relationship one is easy. We've been a big user of Google Cloud products, and we will use more of them, especially their Cloud DNS products as part of this movement over. What was the first set of question? It's around...\nAnalysts: Just the line that you used in the press release around being chosen suggests that maybe there's some competition. If you can speak to that...\nExecutives: Yes, got it, got it, got it. Yes, I can't speak to that because I just -- I'm on my side of this. I just do know that this is not the kind of thing where -- I mean, again, if you put the customer first and you think where is the best home for these customers in addition to us, obviously, this asset is very valuable. \nI think Squarespace ticks so many boxes in terms of our decade-long relationship with Google, reselling Workspace already, our investment in our own registrar and really everything else we've done up to this point. So we're huge fans of supporting Workspace and supporting Google, and I'm just really grateful to have the opportunity to deepen that relationship.\nOperator: That will conclude today's Q&A session. I will now hand the conference back to our management team for any closing remarks.\nExecutives: No, just thank you all for joining on such short notice. It was a great turnout with only an hour's notice. We're really excited about this deal. I'm really personally excited about this deal. And I look forward to working with Google and supporting everybody and making this great for everyone. So thank you all.\nOperator: This concludes today's call. Thank you so much for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.\nOperator: Good afternoon. My name is Sara, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Squarespace's conference call to discuss their definitive agreement to acquire Google Domains assets. [Operator Instructions]\nI will now hand the call over to your host at Squarespace, Clare Perry. Clare, please go ahead.\nExecutives: Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on short notice. As you've seen this afternoon, we've announced Squarespace's proposed acquisition of Google's Domain assets. I'm Clare Perry, Head of Investor Relations. Joining us today to discuss the transaction is Anthony Casalena, Squarespace Founder and CEO. Nathan Gooden, CFO, is on the line as well. Please note that we will not be commenting on our second quarter 2023 or expected full year 2023 guidance during today's call. We expect to provide additional disclosure at our Q2 2023 earnings call. \nWe'd like to remind you that during the course of this conference call, management will make forward-looking statements, including statements regarding the demand and market opportunity for our products and subscriptions, including our beliefs about the anticipated benefits of the proposed acquisition of Google Domains assets for us and Google Domain customers as well as forward-looking statements regarding the anticipated timing of close and our migration and integration plan and our continued execution and focus on providing more value to our customers. \nAlso statements other than historical facts, including our beliefs about the anticipated benefits, our continued execution and focus and the expected benefits of the proposed transaction, are forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current expectations, assumptions, estimates and beliefs. \nWhile we believe these expectations, assumptions, estimates and beliefs are reasonable, such forward-looking statements are only predictions and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties which are beyond our control and which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these statements. These forward-looking statements apply as of today, and one should not rely on them as representing our views in the future. \nToday's call is being recorded, and all participants are currently in listen-only mode. Following brief prepared remarks, we'll open up the call to your questions. With that, I'll turn over the call to Anthony.\nExecutives: Thank you, Clare. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. I'm thrilled to be able to share more about our proposed acquisition of the Google Domains asset. This acquisition offers an unprecedented opportunity to significantly expand our existing domains business and offer our website building tools and other services to millions of additional customers. We're proud to have been chosen as the custodian for these millions of customers and are excited to be working with Google on this critical piece of Internet architecture. Under the terms of this acquisition, approximately 10 million domain names currently managed by Google will be moved to be managed by Squarespace. \nSquarespace's expansive suite of products for entrepreneurs range from websites, e-commerce and marketing tools as well as tools for scheduling with Acuity, creating and managing social media presence with Bio Sites and Unfold and hospitality business management via Tock. Domains are a critical part of web infrastructure and a starting point for many people's journey to establish their online presence. Today, domains are the highest attached product to our core website offering, and we've been investing in our domains business for nearly a decade. \nExisting Google Domains customers will be onboarded to Squarespace's core domains platform, which we've already been investing in for a decade. Squarespace offers some of the most comprehensive domain registration tools in the industry, all embedded within our integrated platform. Throughout the transition period, both Squarespace and Google will remain focused on ensuring a seamless migration for our customers. We will be leveraging existing Google Domains infrastructure to ensure that this process results in no disruption. \nUnder the terms of our agreement, we will honor all existing Google Domains customers' domain renewal prices for at least 12 months following the closing of this transaction. In addition, we'll be providing exclusive incentives to Google Domains customers who wish to adopt any of Squarespace's services moving forward. We do expect to see some degree of natural churn during this transition period as some Google Domains customers may no longer have a need for the domain while some may seek out another solution. \nSquarespace has been a long-time reseller of Google Workspace, and this deal expands and strengthens this partnership. For a period of at least 3 years upon closing, Squarespace will become the exclusive domain provider for any customer purchasing a domain along with our Workspace subscription from Google. \nSome details related to the transaction. Under the terms of the agreement, the purchase price of $180 million is financed through cash on hand and an extension of our existing credit facility. Further details are available in the 8-K we filed earlier today. We expect the transition to close in Q3 2023, subject to the satisfaction of certain regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. We believe this transaction will be meaningfully accretive to our top line and cash flow. And we will see immediate -- and while we will see immediate economic gains after we close this transaction, the majority of the benefits that will be realized in years 2024 and beyond. Additional disclosures about the financial impact of this deal will appear in future financial updates. \nI'd like to again thank Google for believing in us as a partner, and I look forward to what I believe will be a fruitful deal for both of our companies and our customers. With that, let's open the line to your questions.\nOperator: Our first question comes from Trevor Young with Barclays.\nAnalysts: Great. Two, if I may. First, on the 10 million domain installed base that you're getting. Are all of those customers currently at that $12 a year pricing? Or are some of those domains maybe at lower pricing or even free for some of the existing Google customers as part of like some broader promotion and that sort of thing? \nAnd then second one, Anthony, historically, the few acquisitions you've done before were to get some interesting tech, maybe some talent or just features that are a bit differentiated from peers like Tock and Unfold. Domains is maybe a little bit more vanilla and commodity. So just help us think through what's the opportunity that you're playing for here? And what can -- how can you be differentiated on Domains?\nExecutives: Sure. So to your first question around price, I think you're citing what I believe is the lowest of the price is around $12 a year for dotcoms. And I believe they go up from there, depending on TLD. To my knowledge, there are no domains given for free, mostly because, I mean, domains have an underlying cost with Verisign if it's a dotcom. So I don't believe there's any other subsidies or whatnot being given. So all the domains are paid. \nAnd secondarily, I mean, in terms of the opportunity, this is just incredible for us. By the way, it's -- up to 10 million domains could transfer, some could transfer away, et cetera, et cetera. I think we're the best place for these domains, especially considering the landscape of options. But I mean, of these 10 million domains, this is like our lifeblood. These are starting points for websites. They're starting points for entrepreneurs. So we're just so excited to be expanding our business this significantly and also this deeper partnership with Google so that we can be in front of a whole new cohort of new customers with their starting point. \nSo it's a really unique opportunity for us. I have referred to it as maybe bumps in the lifetime. And certainly not in the vein of anything we've done in the past, but we've never seen something like this in the past. And frankly, I doubt we'll ever see something like it again.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ken Wong with Oppenheimer.\nAnalysts: Great. Fantastic. A super interesting acquisition here, Anthony. I was just wondering, can you give us any sense of what the annual domain additions from the Google Domain business might look like as we think about what that potential new customer funnel could potentially be?\nExecutives: So there's a lot of publicly available information on domains and their growth rate for various registrars, which I'm sure you will look up. We won't be providing anything additionally at this time. But there's a multitude of opportunities here. We've got the domains that will be coming in. We'll be -- the underlying reseller agreement we have with Google now, which we'll be providing back-end services for the domains. And then just the ones that are, of course, transferring over as part of the overall agreement. So this represents a really interesting shift in the industry, and I'm just really happy with how we're positioned here.\nAnalysts: Got it. And then as far as just the domain business, natural, there is a good attach on to kind of the core website. Just wondering, as far as registrar, is Squarespace a registrar? Or do you currently utilize a partner on the domain side of things?\nExecutives: We are currently a registrar, and we manage -- we use that registrar to manage some of the most popular TLDs that are on the platform, com, net and org, things like that, which gives us advantageous positioning in terms of our margins. Both Squarespace and Google do rely -- Google Domains currently do rely on a number of other partners to do the long tail of TLD registrations, especially ccTLDs. So we'll continue to move more domains just based on demand into our registrar, but the -- everyone relies on partners to get that 400th domain TLD into the platform.\nAnalysts: Got it. And if I could just maybe sneak a quick one. Just margins -- should we think of this business as having comparable margin profile to the website business? And any color there?\nExecutives: Well, our current domains business doesn't have comparable margins to the website business, right? We manage millions of domains right now. I think over time, there's an ability to improve margin here and there's a lot of tests we can do and other things. But this is not like a loss leader business for us. So -- nor is it for any of the other large companies that sell domains right now.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris  Zhang with Credit Suisse.\nAnalysts: So I have 2 questions. The first one, on the exclusivity part, just wondering about the mechanics. So historically, we think of the need for Google Workspace arising from somebody already using a web builder, for example, Squarespace, and then they decide to use, add a Google Workspace. But to the extent that Google Workspace can serve as kind of a funnel for new customers to Squarespace, historically, what's that like? \nSo what's the kind of percentage of the new customers that typically come from someone that wants to use a Google Workspace and then discovers that we can use Google Workspace, Google Domains. And then from there, since it's -- since they're able to use Squarespace and then add Squarespace, can you give any thoughts on that? And I have a follow-up on the mechanics.\nExecutives: Sure. If I understand the question, I mean, look, there's a lot of ways people go about establishing the core things they need to be -- need to be online. I'd say those core things are a domain and e-mail address and a website. And so at Squarespace, sometimes they're starting with the website. Sometimes they're starting with the domain. We support both those paths. And also conversely, Google, sometimes people are starting with Workspace and then they want the domain or the website. And so the mechanics of it work like this. \nIf you are in Workspace and you're signing up for a domain, they will use an API call behind the scenes to register that domain with Squarespace using our infrastructure as the registrar. But that domain and that front-end customer experience will still be managed by Google. Now we do have -- advantageous to -- we're in a great spot to also sell them a website later, but that's kind of how those mechanics work.\nAnalysts: Got it. That's super helpful. And I think to the extent you can convert additional customers on the domain to Squarespace, what would you think of the percentage that are out of the 10 million domain users? \nFor example, I'd imagine it's probably going to be a little harder for somebody that's already using a competitor's solution just because of the way to like rebuild the website? Or is there going to be any solution to make them -- to convert to Squarespace easier?\nExecutives: We, of course, have our internal models of why we were confident in doing this deal. I'd say that what we're going to be doing over the next couple of months as we -- the first and foremost thing we're focused on is just business continuity and making sure this is smooth for everybody and that we're doing this and there's no disruptions. \nAnd then after that, and I spoke about it earlier and I alluded to it in the press release, there's a lot of opportunities for us to say, hey, where -- you're a new customer of Squarespace, what can we do for you that's kind of an outsized incentive to use Squarespace's products if that's something you want to use? \nI mean there's plenty of people who use Squarespace and only have the domains with us. That's not a rare use case. So I just think it's just great positioning, and I'm super excited about the partnership.\nAnalysts: All right. Anthony, congrats on the transaction.\nExecutives: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Ygal Arounian with Citi.\nAnalysts: Just a follow-up on that last question first. Do you have any sense of how many customers are -- how  many Google Domain customers are currently using Squarespace to build their website? Is that what you're referring to with your internal models? And I have a follow-up.\nExecutives: Yes, we're not really seeing any breakdowns of kind of the services that people are using right now. Yes, it's all across the board.\nAnalysts: Okay. Great. And then I just wanted to maybe hear a little bit more about how you think about domains as kind of a top-of-funnel marketing tool. As we think about how people start their journey, so you talked about the core things that people need to establish to be online. I see some real marketing efficiency over the past couple of quarters. Is this a tool where you could see kind of increased marketing efficiency around -- it's a lower price point just to start a domain versus to start a website? How do you think about that opportunity?\nExecutives: Well, it represents a giant marketing funnel for us. I mean we have millions of domains under management just because of the opportunity to have up to 10 million more without the ongoing synergies that will cause even more people to go kind of over to our platform. And it's going to help us, of course, sell Squarespace services into these millions of domains and millions of customers. So that's kind of really positive for us moving forward. \nLook, just in terms of like the importance of domains, people, a lot of times -- and these are just the 2 flows that we provide on the front of Squarespace right now. Some people want to start with the website. Some people have an idea. They buy a domain, they park it, and they build the website later. So it really just depends where you are and how you prefer to get started. \nBut I mean, right now, I think more than ever, just owning that piece of the Internet, that's the authoritative you, like just a domain is so inexpensive compared to what it is. I mean our price is $20 a year. And you own this piece of the Internet that you control what's on. It's authoritative. \nSo we don't really see the importance of this going away anytime soon. And in fact, as your online presence becomes more and more important, like this is your online real estate, it's critical. So it's why we've been investing in it for a decade. This is not a new business for us. So it's just such a great opportunity for us to be able to strengthen that business and really invest in the domains product further because it's such a critical part of our whole ecosystem.\nAnalysts: If I can ask also one quick follow-up. Is there anything you could share on this just in the conversations with Google during this -- why they were kind of interested in selling this asset, the rationale from their end. I don't know if there's anything you could share or not, but if there is, I'd be interested in that.\nExecutives: Yes. You'd have to reach out to them for commentary on their strategy. I'm mostly focused on why this was just a fantastic opportunity for us because it's just so critical to the website infrastructure. And again, we've been doing this for a decade, almost a decade. We've been a Google Workspace reseller for almost a decade. It's just a really natural fit for our -- in our world. So we're really excited.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Siti Panigrahi.\nAnalysts: I guess everybody is trying to understand that maybe the authoritative part of that comment you said because that's kind of a cross-sell opportunity is kind of what we see there because domain name kind of pretty slow growth, low single-digit kind of growth, domain name's kind of getting saturated, what I think the cross-sell opportunity you said. \nSo I guess I wanted to understand like anybody those who have a domain name had access to other -- all your competitors have access to them, they can reach out to that. So what -- is it the bundling part of it? You can bundle it, your domain name registration along with this, that's sort of attractive, I mean, for those who don't have a website? \nAnd second thing, those who have a website, what really drives someone to change their website and start building something on Squarespace? It's purely a displacement market. So what would trigger that to do it?\nExecutives: So what would trigger somebody to change their website? I mean it's the same kind of factors would kind of be the existing factors in addition to the fact that for us, during this, I mean, just a number of things to emphasize. We're maintaining price continuity. We are reutilizing existing infrastructure to ensure that this is seamless, right? \nSo if you wanted to change registrars right now, one, you have to pay the change because you have to renew your domain to transfer. And then two, you have to make sure all your settings are right so that it doesn't throw up your website or your e-mail and all that. So we're managing all that using existing infrastructure. \nAnd then on top of that -- and we haven't rolled out any of this out yet because we're just at the very beginning of this deal. We're going to be providing interesting incentives and opportunities to people who've moved over as part of this transition for some period of time to utilize Squarespace services. \nSo obviously, just like it is currently on our business, the upsell, cross-sell around the domain, just getting that trio of things attached to it, domain, e-mail, website is really important. And look, domains are not -- well, not the worst margins ever, they're not the highest margin stuff we do. Obviously, that's the website business. And so again, it's a business we've been in for a long time, and we're just excited to have the new opportunities in front of us and to expand it.\nAnalysts: That's a good color. And then do you have any number out of the 10 million, how many of this domain name don't have any websites at this point?\nExecutives: We have an idea, but we're not kind of breaking that down publicly right now.\nAnalysts: Okay. All right.\nExecutives: I mean part of the advantage of us kind of in this kind of process is that, again, this is a business we've had for 10 years. And so we have our own view on churn, pricing, cross-sell, upsell. And we're not treating these the exact same as the domain that would have come in through us, but we're not kind of operating blind here. We have our own infrastructure that runs domain. We support domains right now with our customer operations group. We support Google Workspace with our customer operations group. \nSo in that sense, it's sort of like, it's kind of ideal in a way because, again, we're buying assets here. We don't have to buy any IP. There's a salary change. We're not buying a bunch of head count. There's no infrastructure. I mean, we're utilizing Google's infrastructure, but we're not like -- it's not like buying a company, which, again, I think is very, very good in this transaction for us.\nOperator: The next question comes from Andrew Boone with JMP Securities.\nAnalysts: I wanted to go and ask about the scale of adding 10 million domains for Squarespace. What does that unlock operationally? Does that imply that you guys go after aftermarket? Does that imply anything else now that you guys have more scale?\nExecutives: Yes. So it's up to 10 million depending on what transfers and what doesn't. We think it will be -- we're confident that we're a really, really great home for Domain's customers. What I think about in terms of the future, maybe not going all the way into aftermarket yet but just really making sure that our domains product is the best in the world and that there is no reason why you would ever want to manage a domain anywhere else. \nIt's already very, very, very good. And this will just increase our investment there. But again, it's not like we have to double it, triple it because we've already put so much work into this. So I think it allows us to invest more, but we've always been very disciplined about kind of our headcount and our -- the initiatives that we're on and controlling our cost structure. So we get the thing that's great about this, and we mentioned in the press release, we think this is accretive to both the top and bottom line over time.\nAnalysts: And for my second question, can you just talk about the deal coming together? Was it competitive? How kind of -- how fast or how slow did it take? Just any other details you can share there.\nExecutives: I can't share a lot of details. Obviously, this is an opportunity that a lot of people would have really been very interested in. I think I'm very happy that we were able to partner with Google on this and strengthen the relationship. And I think it's just so great because, again, we've been doing this with Google for like a decade. And so it's a very natural thing for us to support Workspace, very -- I mean, we're huge resellers of Workspace. We support as a Workspace. I use Workspace personally all the time. Like, so it's -- this is more than just anyone who wanted it. Us and Google care so much about the customer experience during this and making sure that the customers have a good home, and that we are companies that share an ethos and customer service and just making sure we have a quality product. So there's a lot of factors that come into this deal that, again, I'm just very pleased and looking forward to supporting these customers, looking forward to working with Google in a closer fashion.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Aaron Kessler with Raymond James.\nAnalysts: A couple of questions. First, any details you can share in terms of maybe the demographics of the Google Domain customers? Are they similar to your current customer base? And second, I think on the Google Domains website, they're currently -- they currently recommend, I think, like 9, 10 website designers on their site. There's -- have them listed. Do you know if those will still stay the same? Or would that be replaced kind of as a primary shift to Squarespace as well?\nExecutives: Well, I can say that Squarespace will probably recommend Squarespace as the website designer of choice that we would prefer. So I think that one's -- we have a strong opinion there. Regarding the demographic, look, we did not go into this blind. We looked at -- we're not going to obviously show the breakdown of it publicly. \nBut we were able to look at this, look at how it overlap with ours, get confidence or not around which segments we were interested in. And we just found that there was a pretty positive fit here. And so, yes, a lot of that analysis and thinking went into our decision here.\nAnalysts: Got it. And so should we primarily be viewing this deal as kind of a lower-cost marketing funnel versus kind of bidding on traffic on various sites? Or is it much more strategic in nature in terms of the cross-selling abilities?\nExecutives: It's everything at once. It's really positive positioning for us. Obviously, the cross-sell and upsell opportunity here, but it's also accretive to the top and bottom line. So -- and there's the Workspace reseller opportunity. I mean there's a lot. \nAnd also, you mentioned this in the press release. We're going to be servicing a number of domains that are moving over that already are using Google Workspace, and we'll be providing the front-end and support for them as we've done for hundreds of thousands of customers already up to this point, maybe even millions. \nSo all those are kind of parts of this. So it's really a multidimensional thing. But it's not like this should be viewed as like, oh, we did it as a marketing spend. It's a positive business outcome for us as well. The same reason why we don't look at domains currently as a loss leader. It's an important part of the experience. We bundled it in with certain plans. We provide incentives around it, but it's a business for us, too.\nAnalysts: Great. Congrats.\nOperator: Our last question will come from Brad Erickson with RBC.\nAnalysts: Just 2 follow-ups. First, following up on Aaron's question, how would you see this kind of affecting your broader customer acquisition strategy? Obviously, it would seem like it makes it more efficient in general. But just curious how does the rest of your normal course customer acquisition strategy change as you build in this piece to the fold? And then I have a follow-up.\nExecutives: I'm not sure it's such a departure, right? Again, I feel like I'm repeating myself but, like, we've been in the domains business for a long time. We've done advertising related to domains. This is going to increase our investment there. I think that, that will mean that we're one of the best places to have a domain. \nAnd so yes, I think it's going to be really interesting for us. And then, of course, that unlocks the cross-sell, upsell stuff. As mentioned before, attached to a domain is one of the highest attach rates we have. As you might imagine, Squarespace live on domain. So yes, there's a lot of different aspects to this deal rolled into one, and that's what's so exciting about it. And you have a follow-up?\nAnalysts: Got it. Yes, just one last one. You mentioned in the press release, you were -- sort of used the word chosen, to kind of effectively win this acquisition. Just curious, maybe speak to how competitive this situation was? And further, just kind of does this have any implications as it pertains to any of your cloud relationships?\nExecutives: Yes. So the cloud relationship one is easy. We've been a big user of Google Cloud products, and we will use more of them, especially their Cloud DNS products as part of this movement over. What was the first set of question? It's around...\nAnalysts: Just the line that you used in the press release around being chosen suggests that maybe there's some competition. If you can speak to that...\nExecutives: Yes, got it, got it, got it. Yes, I can't speak to that because I just -- I'm on my side of this. I just do know that this is not the kind of thing where -- I mean, again, if you put the customer first and you think where is the best home for these customers in addition to us, obviously, this asset is very valuable. \nI think Squarespace ticks so many boxes in terms of our decade-long relationship with Google, reselling Workspace already, our investment in our own registrar and really everything else we've done up to this point. So we're huge fans of supporting Workspace and supporting Google, and I'm just really grateful to have the opportunity to deepen that relationship.\nOperator: That will conclude today's Q&A session. I will now hand the conference back to our management team for any closing remarks.\nExecutives: No, just thank you all for joining on such short notice. It was a great turnout with only an hour's notice. We're really excited about this deal. I'm really personally excited about this deal. And I look forward to working with Google and supporting everybody and making this great for everyone. So thank you all.\nOperator: This concludes today's call. Thank you so much for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",
