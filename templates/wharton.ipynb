         "Thank you, Peter, and welcome, everyone. I will first highlight some of the fourth quarter and full year financial accomplishments and then provide our guidance for the first quarter of 2018. Q4 net sales came in at EUR 2.56 billion, exceeding our guidance by over EUR 400 million. Due to demand strength, some customers requested earlier shipments of lithography systems, which we were able to accommodate late in the quarter. This accounted for almost half of the EUR 400 million and the other half came from earlier-than-expected acceptance of the performance of 2 previously shipped EUV systems by a customer, which led to recognition of deferred revenue in Q4   \nNet system sales of EUR 1.95 billion was threatened by memory contributed 53% of sales; foundry accounted for 29%; and IDM was 18% of system sales.\nInstalled Base Management sales for the quarter came in at EUR 606 million, which was in line with our guidance. Gross margin for the quarter came in at 45.2%, which was 120 basis points higher than our guidance. This was the result of much stronger-than-expected DUV sales, more than offsetting the dilutive effect from incremental EUV revenue that was recognized during the quarter.\nOverall OpEx came in slightly above guidance with R&D expenses at [ EUR 317 million ] and SG&A expenses at EUR 113 million. \nTurning to the balance sheet. Quarter-over-quarter cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments came in at EUR 3.29 billion.\nDuring the quarter, we purchased approximately EUR 331 million worth of shares. Since January 2016, we have purchased a total of approximately 8.2 million shares with the value of EUR 900 million against our 2016/'17 authorization of EUR 1.5 billion.\nMoving on to the order book. Before systems bookings came in at a strong EUR 2.93 billion. This is almost an EUR 800 million increase compared to Q3 bookings. The order intake was driven by the memory sector, representing 55% of orders compared to a 30% for foundry and 15% for IDM.\nThe 10 new orders for EUV systems and our EUV backlog now reflects 28 systems valued at EUR 3.1 billion. Our overall system backlog now totals a record [ EUR 6.68 billion ] and is balanced nicely between memory, foundry and IDM.\nOur strong Q4 results marked the closure of an exceptionally year for the industry and ASML. For the full year, our net sales grew 33% to a record of EUR 9.05 billion. Net Installed Base Management sales grew more than 25% to a record of EUR 2.68 billion.  These total EUV sales almost at EUR 1.2 billion -- 2017 was the year was preparations for inserting EUV into high-volume chip manufacturing shifted into a higher gear. Of the 12 EUV shipments planned for 2017, we shipped 10 during the year; 1 shipment is in progress and 1 shipment is planned this month. This means that our 2018 shipment plan will increase by 2 to a total of 22 systems.\nWe made considerable improvements in our EUV gross margin in 2017, achieving 0% in the fourth quarter. Due to accelerated investments in EUV service infrastructure, we had not achieved 0% for the full year. Nevertheless, even with a more than 3x increase in EUV revenue from 2016 to 2017, we were able to improve our corporate gross margin to 45%. We are on track to achieving overall gross margin exceeding 50% in 2020.\nWe continue to invest in the long-term future of ASML and increase R&D from EUR 1.1 billion in 2016 to EUR 1.26 billion in 2017. This increase was driven by accounting for a full year of HMI, our contributions to sized SMTs, and our own investments in high NA. Overall R&D investments as a percentage of revenue decreased from about 16% in 2016 to about 14% in 2017. \nSG&A as a percentage of revenue were used by almost 1 percentage-point to about 4.6% of revenue.\nOur net income for the full year grew 44% to a record of EUR 2.12 billion, resulting in a net margin of 23.4% and an EPS of EUR 4.93.\nI would like to turn to our expectations and guidance for the first quarter of 2018. We expect Q1 total net sales of around EUR 2.2 billion. As a reminder, we pulled approximately EUR 400 million from this quarter into Q4 2017.\nWhile we target to ship 4 EUV systems in the March quarter, we expect revenue recognition of about EUR 150 million for our EUV business. Overall, we do expect quarter-over-quarter revenue growth throughout 2018.\nWe expect our Q1 Installed Base Management revenue to come in around EUR 600 million. \nGross margin for Q1 is expected to be between 47% and 48%. R&D expenses for Q1 will reflect continued accelerated investment in our portfolio and will come in at around EUR 350 million. And SG&A is expected to come in at about EUR 115 million.\nWe are excited about 2018, which will be a year of continue to strong growth in revenue and profitability."

A transcript of management's opening remarks and a replay of the call will be available on our website shortly following the conclusion of this call.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to caution listeners that comments made by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements involve material risks and uncertainties.  For a discussion of risk factors, I encourage you to review the safe harbor statement contained in today's press release and presentation found on our website at asml.com and in ASML's annual report on Form 20-F and other documents as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to Peter Wennink for a brief introduction.\nExecutives: Thank you, Skip. Good morning you and good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining us for our Fourth Quarter and 2017 Annual Results Conference Call. Before we begin the question-and-answer session, Wolfgang, and I would like to provide you with an overview and some commentary on the fourth quarter and the full year 2017, as well as provide our view of the coming quarters. Wolfgang will start with a review of our fourth quarter financial performance with the -- some added comments on our short-term outlook, and I will complete the introduction with some additional comments on the current business environment and our future business outlook. Thank you.\nExecutives: Thank you, Peter, and welcome, everyone. I will first highlight some of the fourth quarter and full year financial accomplishments and then provide our guidance for the first quarter of 2018. Q4 net sales came in at EUR 2.56 billion, exceeding our guidance by over EUR 400 million. Due to demand strength, some customers requested earlier shipments of lithography systems, which we were able to accommodate late in the quarter. This accounted for almost half of the EUR 400 million and the other half came from earlier-than-expected acceptance of the performance of 2 previously shipped EUV systems by a customer, which led to recognition of deferred revenue in Q4   \nNet system sales of EUR 1.95 billion was threatened by memory contributed 53% of sales; foundry accounted for 29%; and IDM was 18% of system sales.\nInstalled Base Management sales for the quarter came in at EUR 606 million, which was in line with our guidance. Gross margin for the quarter came in at 45.2%, which was 120 basis points higher than our guidance. This was the result of much stronger-than-expected DUV sales, more than offsetting the dilutive effect from incremental EUV revenue that was recognized during the quarter.\nOverall OpEx came in slightly above guidance with R&D expenses at [ EUR 317 million ] and SG&A expenses at EUR 113 million. \nTurning to the balance sheet. Quarter-over-quarter cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments came in at EUR 3.29 billion.\nDuring the quarter, we purchased approximately EUR 331 million worth of shares. Since January 2016, we have purchased a total of approximately 8.2 million shares with the value of EUR 900 million against our 2016/'17 authorization of EUR 1.5 billion.\nMoving on to the order book. Before systems bookings came in at a strong EUR 2.93 billion. This is almost an EUR 800 million increase compared to Q3 bookings. The order intake was driven by the memory sector, representing 55% of orders compared to a 30% for foundry and 15% for IDM.\nThe 10 new orders for EUV systems and our EUV backlog now reflects 28 systems valued at EUR 3.1 billion. Our overall system backlog now totals a record [ EUR 6.68 billion ] and is balanced nicely between memory, foundry and IDM.\nOur strong Q4 results marked the closure of an exceptionally year for the industry and ASML. For the full year, our net sales grew 33% to a record of EUR 9.05 billion. Net Installed Base Management sales grew more than 25% to a record of EUR 2.68 billion.  These total EUV sales almost at EUR 1.2 billion -- 2017 was the year was preparations for inserting EUV into high-volume chip manufacturing shifted into a higher gear. Of the 12 EUV shipments planned for 2017, we shipped 10 during the year; 1 shipment is in progress and 1 shipment is planned this month. This means that our 2018 shipment plan will increase by 2 to a total of 22 systems.\nWe made considerable improvements in our EUV gross margin in 2017, achieving 0% in the fourth quarter. Due to accelerated investments in EUV service infrastructure, we had not achieved 0% for the full year. Nevertheless, even with a more than 3x increase in EUV revenue from 2016 to 2017, we were able to improve our corporate gross margin to 45%. We are on track to achieving overall gross margin exceeding 50% in 2020.\nWe continue to invest in the long-term future of ASML and increase R&D from EUR 1.1 billion in 2016 to EUR 1.26 billion in 2017. This increase was driven by accounting for a full year of HMI, our contributions to sized SMTs, and our own investments in high NA. Overall R&D investments as a percentage of revenue decreased from about 16% in 2016 to about 14% in 2017. \nSG&A as a percentage of revenue were used by almost 1 percentage-point to about 4.6% of revenue.\nOur net income for the full year grew 44% to a record of EUR 2.12 billion, resulting in a net margin of 23.4% and an EPS of EUR 4.93.\nI would like to turn to our expectations and guidance for the first quarter of 2018. We expect Q1 total net sales of around EUR 2.2 billion. As a reminder, we pulled approximately EUR 400 million from this quarter into Q4 2017.\nWhile we target to ship 4 EUV systems in the March quarter, we expect revenue recognition of about EUR 150 million for our EUV business. Overall, we do expect quarter-over-quarter revenue growth throughout 2018.\nWe expect our Q1 Installed Base Management revenue to come in around EUR 600 million. \nGross margin for Q1 is expected to be between 47% and 48%. R&D expenses for Q1 will reflect continued accelerated investment in our portfolio and will come in at around EUR 350 million. And SG&A is expected to come in at about EUR 115 million.\nWe are excited about 2018, which will be a year of continue to strong growth in revenue and profitability.\nExecutives: We also announced a new share buyback program for 2018 and '19 of up to EUR 2.5 billion. We intend to cancel these shares after repurchase with the exception of up to 2.4 million shares, which will be used to cover employee share plans. Additionally, we also -- will propose a 17% increase in our dividend to EUR 1.40 per share at our Annual Shareholder Meeting, which takes place on April 25 in Veldhoven. The dividend payment is valued at around EUR 600 million.\nWith that, I would like to turn the call back over to you, Peter.\nExecutives: Thank you, Wolfgang. As Wolfgang, we had another record year in 2017. The demand for our full portfolio was very strong. Our business continues to perform very well. The strong demand involved logic and memory, set new revenue records across both a sectors in 2017, expanding end market applications, IC device content growth, increasing density all evidenced by our strong backlog, provide a good basis for this positive momentum continuing in 2018.\nMost but certainly due to high demand from the server market, EUV system demand remains strong as our customers continue to migrate to sub 20-nanometer nodes. Advanced nodes are more to intensive and thus drive increased litho demand. \nIn 3D NAND, litho demand is also strong, as another number of customers continue to ramp through Greenfield fabs -- scale vertically which so-called stacked up stacks. Additionally, lithography is required to connect these stacks, which further drives litho events. But adding the NAND opportunity to business outlook for next year, we see another strong memory year ahead.\nLogic demand continues to be solid as customers ramp 10-nanometer and starts transition to the 7-nanometer node. Litho intensity continues to increase with migration to more advanced nodes -- the further growth with the adoption of EUV at 7-nanometers.\nEUV production ramp will accelerate in 2018 as customers are eager to realize the benefits of process simplification, fiber time reduction, the yield improvement and ultimately resulting in cost benefits.\nIn regards to China. We set a new record for this region in 2017 with over EUR 700 million in revenue. In addition to strong demand from existing customers in the region, we also plan to ship to 5 domestic customers in 2018 with both memory and logic applications. With the continued ramp of fabs in China, both from domestic and nondomestic customers, we see a very clear growth opportunity in this region over the coming years.\nproduct side is going to start of another in our EUV business. In EUV, we continue to make significant progress in 2017. We demonstrated all system specifications, including 125 fabs per hour while continuing to improve availability. Customer demand is strong, evidenced by public statements of their plans to introduce this technology with volume production starting in 2018.\nWe booked 10 EUV orders in Q4 -- they are back up to 28 systems, in which we plan to shipment 22 in 2018. Shipment profile, however, will be back half loaded as our plans step-up and move rate would effectively only have an impact second half in 2018. Our EUV shipment plan beyond 2018 is unchanged, and 30-plus in 2019 and 40-plus in 2020.\nIn EUV, which ship the total of 161 new systems in 2017, which is a 21% increase from 2016. We were able to significantly boost output in support of our increased customer demand in both memory and logic.  We also provided customers with an early access version of the TWINSCAN NXE:2000, which is our most advanced immersion lithography system used for process development of the NXT node devices. Inside of the continuously increasing majority of the Annex the platform, the NXE:2000 system already meets or exceeds all of its performance targets. \nWith 3D NAND customers, we expanded our office portfolio, we addressed critical process challenges and delivery of improved performance.\nIn Holistic Lithography, we showed growth across the full portfolio of software and metrology products. We shipped our first jointly-developed product less than 1 year after closing of the HMI acquisition.  This product, ePfm5, the pattern fidelity metrology system that leverages HMI's high-resolution e-beam metrology with ASML's computational lithography technology. This product's high-resolution capability enables high capture rate for systematic patterning defects so customers can accelerate the yield learning curves and drive higher production yields. Both of these we shipped our first EUV e-beam mass inspection system.\nMoving to 2018, we completed expect continued solid growth in both sales and profitability, our high-level view of 2018 business is largely unchanged relative to comments that we made last quarter. While we were able to recognize an additional EUR 400 million of revenue in 2017, which could be seen as a full [indiscernible] of 2018, we will not impact our view of 2018 as it will be wholly compensated by increased EUV demand.\nIn summary, we had another record year in 2017 with 33% revenue growth and 44% net income growth over 2016 from demand involved logic and memory set new records in 2017. And we expect both sectors to see continued growth in 2018 supported by increased EUV sales.\nExpanding end market applications, device IC content growth, increasing litho intensity, as evidenced by our record backlog, provide strong indication that this positive momentum will continue in 2018. With that, we will be happy to take your questions.\nExecutives: Thank you, Peter. [Operator Instructions] Before I hand and ask you kindly limit yourself to one question we do on short follow up, if necessary. This will allow us to get at as many callers as possible. Now operator, do we have your final instructions and first questions, please.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Mr. Farhan Ahmad.\nAnalysts: This is Farhan Ahmad from Credit Suisse. My question is on EUV. You booked them -- system orders. Can you talk about the mix of customers within that? Is it coming from memory or foundry? And are there many -- multiple customers within that?\nExecutives: Yes -- multiple customers. It is dominated by the logic side of our business, and that is also when we look at next year -- next year, sales increase in logic really driven by EUV. And the memory sales increase is driven by DUV.\nAnalysts: Got it. And then in terms of the linearity for the year, is there much change between memory and logic links in the year as first half more memory demand and second more foundry, logic as some of the other companies have set?\nExecutives: Not on the DUV side, not on the EUV side -- as mentioned in the prepared remarks, it will be more backend-loaded.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mr. C.J. Muse.\nAnalysts: C.J. Muse, Evercore ISI. First question, I guess -- was hoping that you could discuss, Peter, what you're seeing in the supply chain on the EUV side. Would look love to get an update in terms of optics and things like that. And whether you're feeling better, same, worse in terms of your head that [ 30-tool ] target into the 2019 time frame?\nExecutives: Yes. I think with respect to my feeling, no changes. I think it's the same as we said last quarter. That has to do with the fact that the step-ups in capacity are really long lead time items. So this is not something that you change 1 quarter to the other. So the supply chain situation is what it is. And I think the [ 30-plus ] is limited, as we said before, by the supply chain. And the 40-plus is really when this supply chain can kick into the next steps. So no real change.\nAnalysts: Okay. And I guess as my follow-up, you got the gross margin higher year-over-year despite the nice tick -- higher in EUV shipments. So I'm curious if you think about non-EUV and growth in inspection and an uptick on the DUV side, is it fair to say that overall, that part of your business can do roughly 53%, 54% gross margin through the year?\nExecutives: I wouldn't like it -- to nail it down to an exact percentage but if you look at both other businesses, so the Holistic Lithography business and the DUV business, you will see an increased mix towards the more powerful machines, and that has a positive effect on gross margins also with -- continued with a lot of a very profitable upgrades. And then from our mix between DUV and Holistic Lithography, you will see also on next 2 or 3 years, a continued mix towards Holistic Lithography which will have a slightly higher mix in our overall revenue. And since this is a very software-driven -- it structurally also contributes to the non-EUV business being up. So both effects -- both of these businesses go up based on the products that we offer and then you also have a mix base effect. And that, of course, comes together with us making significant progress on EUV, and that's why we feel confident that from the 45%, we can advance in 2018 and then get to our 50%-plus in 2020.\nExecutives: C.J., if I just make 1 general comment on this is going forward, I mean, we are guiding -- and as we did, we are guiding a corporate gross margin. And do that because if you look at what our customers really want from us is node-to-node transitions. And node-to-node transitions going forward are really a combination of the entire set of products and services that we are offering. So you will see agreements with our customers that involve EUV, DUV, holistic and applications in 1 go, and we will make 1 PPA, which expects -- which effectively gives us on gross [indiscernible] margin. So going forward, we will guide you more and more on the overall corporate gross margin because it doesn't make sense to give you and I don't want to do it either -- give you any specific gross margin guidance for those products because we have the for the entire product portfolio of ASML.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mr. Sandeep Deshpande.\nAnalysts: Sandeep Deshpande from JPMorgan. My first question is on EUV. Could you possibly help us understand in terms of the recognition on EUV into 2018. Are you going to be recognizing all the tools on shipments by the second half of this year, as well as the past deferred revenue on EUV -- will be fully recognized in 2018? And I have a quick follow up on EUV as well.\nExecutives: Okay. Let me see whether I can structure this for you because there's a lot of moving parts here. The first comment is by the end of the year, we should be able to recognize the majority of the revenue office system as we ship it. At the beginning of the year, we still have shipments, as you have heard from my prepared remarks -- Q1, for instance, we're planning to ship 4 systems, recognizing only EUR 150 million. There are still shipments that have -- or tools that have changed within them that have required us to greater the revenue recognition for an acceptance of the tool at the customer side. So these Q1 shipments will, however, recognize in the second half of the year. On top of that, we are carrying a deferred revenue balance of around EUR 500 million on our balance sheet from prior shipments, and they're both short-term and long-term, so some of them will come into the P&L in 2018 and some will even carry a little bit into 2019. If you put it altogether, we expect the year revenue for the EUV business to be somewhere in the EUR 2.3 billion range for the year. As a reminder, and just so for clarification, we set EUR 2.5 billion on the last call but, of course, we achieved the acceptance of 2 tools already in 2017 and of course, they moved into 2017 where we overachieved by EUR 200 million. I hope that helps, Sandeep.\nAnalysts: And then following up to your earlier response, Peter, regarding EUV for 2019. I mean, some of those very strong orders you talked in the fourth quarter are clearly 2019-related. How do you see -- I mean, the order basis for 2019, do you expect because of your lead time, you'll that almost all of the 2019-related EUV orders in this year itself? Or this is going to continue through next year in terms of getting orders? And then had -- will we also start seeing a 2020 level of indication from customers for EUV?\nExecutives: Yes. I think what we're working on, and because there's also 1 customer request is clearly a reduction of the cycle time of our EUV tools. I mean, it has to come down by 2020. We really like to be at the cycle time, [indiscernible] them 12 and 15 months. That means also customers will take account of that, and that means that they will actually postpone issuing the orders to reflect that reduced cycle time. Now the first cycle time reductions, we will probably see somewhere in the towards the end of 2018. But I would suspect that the majority, I think the significant majority of everything that we will ship in 2019 will be booked in 2018. Because these cycle time reductions will really affect later, and that will not have an effect on the order -- lead time of our customers. So vast majority should be in this year.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mr. Amit Harchandani.\nAnalysts: Amit Harchandani from Citigroup. My first question would be with regards to the current traction you're seeing on the high NA EUV side. If you could update us on the same? And as in the context of your 2020 ambition but clearly, the market is looking for some color on trajectory in terms of how revenues are likely to shape up beyond 2020, and high NA is a typical ingredient of the same. So it would be great to know your thoughts on the same, and then I have a follow-up.\nExecutives: Yes, that's a good question. I think we have had extensive discussion with our customers on our high NA concept. I mean, the -- how the machine looks like and the performance specifications we started that already way into 2017. I think we got our confirmation from all our major customers that high NA makes complete sense from a technical point of view, from an economical point of view, so they want us to execute on this. Now currently, we are in discussions with our customers on their loan terms and conditions we should start shipping the first R&D tools and how quickly after the R&D tools we should start ramping up for volume. Now having said that, we realize that high NA tool is really a new scanner. It's not so much a new EUV source. As you know, the EUV source being the main reason why there was a delay with the EUV introduction. And we were using the same source as for the current EUV generation. So that means is that we would be able to actually see a high volume, high NA EUV tools is shaping somewhere in the middle of the next decade. Starting to be used in the high volume production and then ramping in the second half of the next decade. Now those will be tools that we're currently looking at, pricing significantly over to EUR 200 million. And that means that if you then look beyond the 2020 target number in terms of sales, we don't need a lot of imagination to foresee our top line growing significantly beyond 2020, and that will be, driven by EUV and next-generation.\nAnalysts: An an unrelated follow-up, if I could get some clarity around China. You've given us an idea of shipment to domestic customers in 2018. And the you talked about the community of opportunity, if I remember correctly, of around EUR 3 billion. Could you give us on -- have -- is your sentiment more positive, more negative? And how are you thinking about China over the next 2 to 3 years?\nExecutives: Yes. I think we actually mentioned that EUR 3 billion mark. But that takes into account, and take our view as to the speed, a realistic speed with which our domestic Chinese customers will be able to ramp their fabs and to get their products qualified. Now if they can't do this faster, then then you would probably see an uptick on that EUR 3 billion. And if you would do it, let's say, at a speed, which we would normally see a memory and logic, you could probably get to a number that's almost twice as high as the EUR 3 billion. But that is given the fact that many of these are Greenfield fabs, those are greenfield companies. And that's why we take a more conservative view. But I would say, let's stick to the EUR 3 billion and let's work very closely together with those customers to see whether they get accelerated.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mr. Jagadish Iyer.\nAnalysts: Sameet Rajasthan. Two questions, Peter. If you look at the foundry logic, if you look at calendar '17, there is not been a significant uptick in your revenue and foundry and logic segment. Whereas if you compare it to the memory, there has been a significant uptick there. So how should we think about growth in memory revenues in calendar '18? And is there a potential risk that these customers decide to scale back on capital spending if the pricing environment does not support such a situation? And I have a follow-up.\nExecutives: Yes. I think both for memory and logic, we see a similar in 2018 with -- given there are some potential upside which is customer-driven. I think that -- the second half of your question is probably more relevant one because it comes up time and time again. Now the way we look at this is are we creating overcapacity in terms of the beat supply into the memory market, both DRAM and the NAND. Now if we look at our customers are currently asking us and the forecast that they gave us is what they want in 2018, your question is not fully yet in the backlog. And if we take that, and if we take into account the nodes that they want to use this on, the effect it will have on the bit density -- then we can calculate what the capacity addition will be in terms of bits. And in DRAM, where we will probably anywhere -- let's mid-20s [indiscernible] so anywhere between 22% to 25%. And in NAND, the capacity addition of what we can see based on litho will be around mid-40s, and these are currently our customers will talk about in the analysts are talking about it, it's about the same as the demand bit growth looks like. So when we take those 2 together and we look at the capability of the lithography machines to add bits, it seems it's pretty much in balance. So is there a risk? There's always a risk because units about the end markets, it's about the global economy. But from where we are today, we don't see that as a major issue.\nAnalysts: Okay. And then I have a follow-up. So you talked about EUV, and you talked about 125 wafers. And on a high level, can you kind of quantify in calendar '17 in terms of your progress, in terms of productivity of it and availability. And what should be the milestone for calendar '18 -- not quarter-to-quarter variation but just on an overall annual level milestones?\nExecutives: Yes. You have to realize that nobody has EUV in full production yet. I mean, it's all coming out of the development phase. So they're qualifying product, which actually means nobody runs 25 wafers per hour continuously. I mean, we're not there. We actually started in the back half of 2018. But that capability is actually there and the by the customers and by us -- they'll show us that capability. Now with respect to the availability with a 3400, we're over 80%. We see significantly over [ 80% ] And I think the target by the end of this year will be that -- the availability numbers are such that customers are comfortable to put the tools into production that will give them around 1500, maximum 2000 wafers per day, and that is then a result of [ 25 ] wafers per hour on average and availability and the -- let's say inactive hours that customers are planning for their own production. So that's part of your 2000 wafers per day, that is what we are focusing on and that seems feasible with everything we have on the table today, which I think as evidenced by the fact that customers are getting us orders. We got [ 10 ] orders in Q4.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mr. Dave Mulholland.\nAnalysts: David Mulholland from UBS. Firstly, one of the strengths in the quarter was clearly the memory bookings. I wonder if you could just help us understand how that breaks down in the quarter for as much visibility that you have between DRAM and NAND, and how that's unchanged versus Q3? And also how much of it is coming from China at this stage. And then I've got a follow up.\nExecutives: Yes. To answer your last part, China, of course, we have greenfield fabs there. We're not going to ramp like I said in -- as an answer to an earlier question, going to ramp up at the same speed as the mature memory companies. So they will take those tools and will use those tools to create a first-line where they can qualify their product. So it will be -- it is in there in terms of the bookings. Now split between DRAM and NAND is very difficult for the simple reason that customers are continuously assessing how to allocate lithography capabilities and their capacity between DRAM and between NAND. And there are a lot of relocations going on between DRAM and NAND. That's why some time ago, we decided to just give you the memory segment as 1 segment. And that's good between DRAM and NAND because they are continuously changing because of those -- the reallocations.\nAnalysts: That's clear. And then just on the follow-up. One of the comments you made was -- obviously, 2 tools being recognized earlier in Q4. I just wondered if you can give us some clarity on what drove that? Was it customer lowering the performance requirement they go earlier? Or was it better performance on your side in terms of getting to the targets quicker?\nExecutives: It was because the customer signed off on the specification we agreed when we shipped the tool. So no better or worse specification -- just we met the specification in the signoff.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mr. Jerome Ramel.\nAnalysts: Yes, Jerome Ramel, Exxon of BNP Paribas. One quick question on EUV. Can you update us on the and mask inspection and\nExecutives: Okay. Mask inspection, well okay, we shipped the first mask inspection tool through our HMI subsidiary. Mask in itself, as we also showed in the specification this morning, where we have the excess -- at least we show we make significant progress on the development. So the goals are now able to be used at the 250-watt power level, lifetime of is going up there -- all moving nicely into the volume that's an area. So masks and the mask infrastructure, we don't think has an issue that will prevent our customers to put EUV into volume production in the course of the year.\nAnalysts: And another follow-up on the high NA EUV. Some of your potential client made a comment that they might need to build new fabs to go with the new tools. Is that reason you are sharing? The question is can we eventually use high NA EUV in existing fabs, or do we have the redesign the fabs?\nExecutives: Well, I think similar to the current EUV tool. I mean, when we echo 5 years ago, the current EUV tool did not fit into many of the fabs at that moment in time. I mean, it's a better high -- it's the strength floor, it's a bigger tools. But this is, as long as -- and this is why we have such a coordinated and very detailed interest and our customers on high NA, is also to make sure that they understand the full specification sets, not only from a lithography point of view, but also from logistics set and a facility management point of view. That's been communicated and I hope customers will build new fabs and not only because high NA -- because the markets is growing, and we need more of those devices and I think they were the main reason why we start building new fabs and then take into account that's all the tools are a bit bigger.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mr. Douglas Smith.\nAnalysts: I noticed that the dry EUV moved up from 20 units to 25 units Q3 to Q4. But the emerging went from 22 to 20. Is that evidence of the increasing importance of NAND in your portfolio?\nExecutives: No. I think it's -- to draw conclusions on the quarter-to-quarter, comparison between Q3 and Q4 is -- I think probably shouldn't do that because it's a -- it all kinds of affect customer-specific shipments. But generally, I would say that the dry DUV systems are going up in numbers going forward. Because, yes, you are absolutely correct, there is a higher need in the 3D NAND space. Now it's not only because the 3D NAND space grows, but it's for different reasons. One, we use stacks for stacks, like I said in my prepared comments, which actually means you need extra little stacks to connect those stacks -- that is one. But also there is an specific requirements that we need to put those drive tools because there are peculiarities, I could say, with the 3D NAND manufacturing, which have to do with what wafers, would have to do with opaque layers so that -- its alignment needs to be different. And all those specific peculiarities of 3D NAND will be addressed by us by being out the tools and options on the tools that will enable our customers to increase their yields and to make sure that they can do effective 3D NAND production.\nAnalysts: Got it. On --a kind of related issue. I was wondering, are you seeing any evidence yet that with the traction of EUV, customers might be planning on ordering fewer emergency stems, which I guess is kind the whole point of introducing EUV in the longer term?\nExecutives: Yes. I think -- what I think is probably -- best as we look at our Analyst Day of 2016. We gave you a couple of scenarios where high EUV introduction, lower EUV introduction for several reasons. It could be -- EUV an obvious effective as we do not at that moment in time plan, or whether markets were difficult. You can actually conclude from those scenarios that higher EUV will lead to somewhat lower emergence but still somewhat significant. And it's logical because it will cannibalize some of the multiple fattening layers. On the other hand also, layers are growing. So it also there is dilutive effect in that sense that you have more layers and some of those layers will be deep UV layers, will be -- no emergent layers. So how -- if you look at it, the number of EUV of immersion systems will still remain significant -- also with high EUV introduction. So -- this is I'd like to refer back to that, to those 4 scenarios that we showed in the 2016.\nExecutives: And just to give you the numbers. I mean, the 4 scenarios is anything between 50 and 80 tools, and that -- right in the middle of that range around 70s, what we're shipping right now is it's not -- in no case, it is going down significantly.\nAnalysts: Right. So -- is that you are saying it's too early really to touch the level of cannibalization of EUV to immersion?\nExecutives: Yes. There will be probably some. I mean if we look at a quite, at a good EUV adoption, which is I think is a realistic assumption right now, then yes, there will be some effect on immersion tools, but it's not going to be significant.\nExecutives: I think, by the way, that if you look at over the lifetime of over a very long period it's actually not cannibalizing immersion at all because EUV, at 1 point in -- without EUV at 1 point in time, there would not be even new nodes. And if there's a node, there will also always be layers for emergent. So if you don't get it on a very long period of time, it's actually not cannibalizing at all. It's actually keeping it alive.\nAnalysts: Yes, that's a good point.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini.\nAnalysts: Mehdi Hosseini from Susquehanna International. A couple of follow-up. Peter, how should I think about your DRAM customers that are planning for EUV? Would that take for you to hit that 2,000 wafer per-day target before you see a step-up in booking activity? Or is there any other metric that I need to track? And any insight here would be great. And I have a couple of follow-ups.\nExecutives: Yes. I think -- you know it's not a surprise that DRAM devices are more cost-sensitive than the advanced logic. So it is true that the 2,000 wafers per day is, as we've said it before, is a realistic economic productivity target. I think if we meet that target, or let's say, on a continuous basis, it's our assessment that, that will be a very attractive economic entry point for DRAM. Now -- and how realistic is 2,000 wafers per day? With everything that we have on the road map today, I think it is realistic to be by the end of the year. So now, that's we're very hard and execute on it we were closely with our customers to get to that point because that, of course -- it will be only for a very few layers, but there's a lot of DRAM wafers so that could give an extra to our EUV story.\nAnalysts: Sure. Now I wanted to reconcile this with large-source capacity. How long will it take for Zeiss to add additional capacity? Do you have any flexibility to accelerate investment there or accelerate capacity, manufacturing capacity so that your 30-plus target for 2019 could increase? And I'm asking you this because if you're able to increase confidence among your DRAM customers that you can actually do 2,000 wafers per day, wouldn't they need to place a PO before '19? And wouldn't some of these EUV shipments would have to take place into DRAM customer by late '19? So that doesn't have to create kind of a double-edged sword? And I wanted to get your view on kind of leverage that you can pull to accommodate this DRAM customers?\nExecutives: Yes -- no, it's -- you've asked a very elaborate question, and I'll give you a very simple answer. The away that we -- the lead time to increase capacity at Zeiss has lapsed. I mean, we are where we are today. Whether you get a 30-plus and how much of the plus is dependent on the cycle time reduction in the factory of Zeiss. The faster they can do that and the better they can do that, the more we can squeeze out. Because everything else, on long lead time cycle items in terms of capacities, buildings, machines, people planning -- the whole thing, that will not happen until 2020. And our output in 2020, which their output in 2019. So that means that we have what we have. And that also means we are very transparent to our customers on 2019 potential shipment plan and when those machines will come available, very transparent to every customer. And it's up to them to decide whether they want to take up that capacity. And as very little we can do other than -- just working very hard with our Zeiss colleagues expect to keep reducing the cycle time to squeeze out a few extra. But that's what it is and it's up to the customers to react on the transparency that we will give them.\nExecutives: And the probably 2 clarifications, just in case I could -- your questions wrong. You refer to the light source. Of course, the light source is not done at Zeiss -- it's the optical system. And secondly, you seem to imply that DRAM EUV shipments would start late in 2019. We are already shipping EUV systems now. So I mean, it will also be in DRAM in high-volume manufacturing in 2019, just so that's clear.\nAnalysts: Thanks for the correction. Thus elaborate question give me a quick follow-up?\nExecutives: Yes. [indiscernible] the essence of time.\nAnalysts: Great. Many interesting about mass EUV mask inspection, you said that you have already shipped this -- your first tool. How should we think about a year or 2 from now, should we assume that you actually can turn this into a volume production and actually help customers need the inspection or mask inspection without relying on other vendors?\nExecutives: Well, yes, it's a fully equipped mask inspection tools. So it's an EUV tool -- can be used used for mask inspection. And the more EUV is used in terms of layers, can be more mask inspection tools are needed. So I think we just are going to deliver and ship it in that market. But yes, it is what it is, and I think when we did the HMI acquisition last year, I think we also [indiscernible] for the year before in 2016, I think we did discuss the opportunity of EUV mask inspection as a couple of hundred million euros. It is where it is and the success of EUV will, of course, help us also penetrate that market.\nOperator: The next question comes from [indiscernible].\nAnalysts: from Berenberg. The first question on the cycle, I understand that based on your comments, 2018 is likely to be a nice year. I'm just wondering what's your view on 2019 and what kind of be the end market driver there?\nExecutives: Well, I've just sold my crystal ball, so I can't -- I really can't answer this. But it all depends on the end markets. I mean, I needs -- but just a high-level answer, the penetration of icy devices into almost everything now is -- it actually makes it more volatile, macroeconomics swings. So you want to talk about cycles, I think we'll be macroeconomics cycles. I said it in the press conference this morning also. But when that happens, I don't know, yes? The only thing is when it happens we will be able to react up or down, and in many your occasions, you seem to indicate -- what's the possibility of a downward question, I don't know but when it happens, we have all the means and the flexibility to react.\nAnalysts: Okay. And the second question is you talked about the EUV will actually limit the demand for deep UV. So in general, I would say, does that mean equipment have become more and more expensive for the chip chipmakers over time, so therefore they will have to keep, buy the more expansive and more equipment for making the lead a [indiscernible] So I'm not sure how you view this point. Do you, as an equipment maker, need to cut the prices at certain point, so that they don't have to take crazy CapEx order time? Or can they actually pass on the incremental CapEx to their customers?\nExecutives: Well, what you're basically asking is Moore's Law survival, yes? Because when I just -- just before the press conference, I bumped into one of the really senior ace, a male -- as you know, this is great where the company is going. I still remember sending the first invoice for $1 million. Now we're selling EUR 120 million tool, so to your point, yes, customers have started to pay a lot more for those tools but, of course, the transition and the cost per function has continuously gone down on a logarithmic scale, yes,? So it's Moore's Law viable? Yes, it is still viable and yes, our customers will pay higher prices for our change, whereby the cost per function should keep going down.\nOperator: The next question will come from Mr. Andrew Gardiner.\nAnalysts: It's Andrew Gardiner from Barclays. We spent quite a bit of time talking about memory this afternoon. I was just wondering if we could spend a minute or 2 on logic. And just in terms of the -- first on the near-term thinking through 2018 and the sort of trend towards, sort of node migration plans in place there. How do you view your sort of visibility into that logic business this year? I presume it's better or sort of firmer than we see in memory where you seem to be highlighting the potential risk in the back half, or its least lack of visibility in the back half. But how -- so where is your conviction level or where our customer -- sort of order rates in terms of the 10-nanometer migrations?\nExecutives: Yes, I think what -- we haven't changed our view as compared to what 1 or 2 quarters ago. I mean, the logic 10-nanometer tamp is still going. Actually, 2 to the areas in China where we are shipping 14 and 28 and more importantly, I think what we will see is by the back half of the year, we'll start to see EUV going into 7-nanometer pilot production. This ramp,  and also, if you look at the comments made up by our customers and their assessment of the size of the nodes, there is no reason whatsoever to believe that they -- that there is an indication that those nodes will actually dwindle in terms of number of wafers that they would need to build that capacity. And on the contrary, I think comments are being made on the customers on the 7 and 10-nanometer nodes as being very large nodes, and were a lot day of So there is no indication whatsoever to change our view. And like I said earlier, we look at the memory and the logic business between 2018 developing at least at the same level as 2017 for both logic and memory with some upside here and there.\nAnalysts: Okay. If I could have a quick accounting follow-up for Wolfgang. We're starting to see the sort of the Zeiss investment comes through in terms of the equity income line. It was somewhat negative in the fourth quarter. Is there a rough rule of thumb we should be thinking of as we in our models for future periods?\nExecutives: Yes. First of all, for everybody, we had 2 agreements with Zeiss; one was high NA investment agreement, and one was an equity agreement. High NA E, 1, obviously, goes through our R&D line and also through our balance as it relates to the CapEx. But as it relates to the equity investment, we'll see that equity method investments on the balance sheet of about EUR 1 billion for the 24.9% that we own. And then you see 2 elements in our financial statements. First of all, you see in the P&L a profit that's attributed to those in 24.9%. And, therefore, the first quarter you are still negative EUR 17 million. And the second thing that you see is in our cash flow from investing. You see the dividend attributed to that investment, and you see that we received a dividend also for our 3-month period of almost EUR 20 million. For the dividend is basically --  since SMT basically distributes their earnings, a very good reflection of the profitability of that business. Now accounting makes this a little bit complicated because you need to do numerous things about you're starting from a very healthy profit. And then you start off with #1, the adjustment from IFRS to U.S. GAAP. Number two, you adjust for differences in accounting policies between the companies. But at the end 3, as said, where it really hits you, even though it's not an acquisition, you still need to the purchase price accounting. That means you need to write up the inventory to the fair market value. You need to identify intangibles and then you do the same thing what we have reversed talking about when we talked about HMI, you need to consume that inventory, and you need to amortized these intangibles. And that takes you profit all the way to [ EUR 17 million ] As it relates to the future, this is something that will still be with us for a long time because these intangibles has a lifetime of 15 years most. But the inventory part, we will walk through within a year-or-so. So I think our net-net for 2018, this will still be in loss and then in 2019, we will also see a profit on that line [indiscernible]. And the cash, of course, follows the true profit and cash flow of SMT. And from a cash flow perspective, you should see a much, much higher number every year.\nAnalysts: It wasn't such a good follow-up, sorry.\nExecutives: [indiscernible]\nExecutives: Ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one more question. If you're unable to get through from this call, still have some questions, please feel free to contact the ASML Investor Relations department with your question. Now operator, if we have the last caller please.\nOperator: The final question will come from Mr. Robert Sanders.\nAnalysts: It's Deutsche Bank. I just have the last question on the EUV backlog. Just in terms of how many of those 28 tools are with the planned 251 configuration as opposed to -- I think it's in 205 of the standard tool? And I have a follow-up.\nExecutives: All of them. There will be -- even if it's we have the commitment to have all those ultimately be to lower than [ 2051 ] so in fact that you're all that the 2051 configuration.\nAnalysts: I got it. So all of them will have an extra amount of money to be built as the customer want to get to the [ 250 watts ] because that's been the spec, right?\nExecutives: Because the spec is -- we need to do [ 250 watt ] to get over [ 2051 ] wafers. So when we get over [ 250 watts ], we get more wafers out there, we get extra money. But 125 wafers is what we saw today.\nAnalysts: Okay. And just last question for Wolfgang, just on the gross margin on 2018. Given what you said about being higher than I think 45, is 45% to 46% a kind of good model -- number for our models for 2018? You can just give us a vague range, that would be great.\nExecutives: I think we would not have the result if it's only extremely marginal, but I don't want to type down to a specific number at this point either. So will go through the year and the more important thing is it will be a step forward towards the 50-plus in 2020 and that's really what we are shooting for.\nExecutives: Now on behalf of the ASML management, I would like to thank you all for joining us today. Operator, if you could conclude the call, I'd appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: , of course, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the ASML 2017 Fourth Quarter and Annual Financial Results Conference Call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the ASML 2017 Fourth Quarter and Annual Financial Results Conference Call on January 17, 2018. [Operator Instructions] \nI would now like to to open the question-and-answer queue. [Operator Instructions] \nI would now like to turn the conference call over to Mr. Skip Miller. Go ahead please, sir.\nExecutives: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, good morning, ladies and gentlemen. This is Skip Miller, Vice President of Investor Relations at ASML. Joining me today from ASML headquarters in Veldhoven in Netherlands is ASML CEO, Peter Wennink; and CFO, Wolfgang Nickl. \nThe subject of today's call is ASML's 2017 fourth quarter and annual results. The length of this call will be 60 minutes, and questions will be taken in the order that they are received. This call is also being broadcast live over the Internet at asml.com. A transcript of management's opening remarks and a replay of the call will be available on our website shortly following the conclusion of this call.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to caution listeners that comments made by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements involve material risks and uncertainties. For a discussion of risk factors, I encourage you to review the safe harbor statement contained in today's press release and presentation found on our website at asml.com and in ASML's annual report on Form 20-F and other documents as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to Peter Wennink for a brief introduction.\nExecutives: Thank you, Skip. Good morning and good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining us for our Fourth Quarter and 2017 Annual Results Conference Call. \nBefore we begin the question-and-answer session, Wolfgang and I would like to provide you with an overview and some commentary on the fourth quarter and the full year 2017 as well as provide our view of the coming quarters. Wolfgang will start with a review of our fourth quarter financial performance with the -- some added comments on our short-term outlook, and I will complete the introduction with some additional comments on the current business environment and our future business outlook. \nThank you.\nExecutives: Thank you, Peter, and welcome, everyone. I will first highlight some of the fourth quarter and full year financial accomplishments and then provide our guidance for the first quarter of 2018. \nQ4 net sales came in at EUR 2.56 billion, exceeding our guidance by over EUR 400 million. Due to demand strength, some customers requested earlier shipments of lithography systems, which we were able to accommodate late in the quarter. This accounted for almost half of the EUR 400 million, and the other half came from earlier-than-expected acceptance of the performance of 2 previously shipped EUV systems by a customer, which led to recognition of deferred revenue in Q4 net system sales of EUR 1.95 billion was strengthened by memory, which contributed 53% of sales, foundry accounted for 29% and IDM was 18% of system sales. Installed Base Management sales for the quarter came in at EUR 606 million, which was in line with our guidance. \nGross margin for the quarter came in at 45.2%, which was 120 basis points higher than our guidance. This was the result of much stronger-than-expected DUV sales, more than offsetting the dilutive effect from incremental EUV revenue that was recognized during the quarter. Overall OpEx came in slightly above guidance with R&D expenses at EUR 317 million and SG&A expenses at EUR 113 million. \nTurning to the balance sheet. Quarter-over-quarter cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments came in at EUR 3.29 billion. During the quarter, we purchased approximately EUR 331 million worth of shares. Since January 2016, we have purchased a total of approximately 8.2 million shares with a value of EUR 900 million against our 2016, '17 authorization of EUR 1.5 billion.\nMoving on to the order book. Q4 systems bookings came in at a strong EUR 2.93 billion. This is almost an EUR 800 million increase compared to Q3 bookings. The order intake was driven by the memory sector, representing 55% of orders, compared to  30% for foundry and 15% for IDM. We took 10 new orders for EUV systems, and our EUV backlog now reflects 28 systems valued at EUR 3.1 billion. Our overall system backlog now totals a record EUR 6.68 billion and is balanced nicely between memory, foundry and IDM.\nOur strong Q4 results marked the closure of an exceptional year for the industry and ASML. For the full year, our net sales grew 33% to a record of EUR 9.05 billion. Net Installed Base Management sales grew more than 25% to a record of EUR 2.68 billion. With total EUV sales almost at EUR 1.2 billion, 2017 was the year when preparations for inserting EUV into high-volume chip manufacturing shifted into a higher gear. Of the 12 EUV shipments planned for 2017, we shipped 10 during the year. One shipment is in progress, and one shipment is planned this month. This means that our 2018 shipment plan will increase by 2 to a total of 22 systems.\nWe made considerable improvements on our EUV gross margin in 2017, achieving 0% in the fourth quarter. Due to accelerated investments in EUV service infrastructure, we had not achieved 0% for the full year. Nevertheless, even with a more than 3x increase in EUV revenue from 2016 to 2017, we were able to improve our corporate gross margin to 45%. We are on track to achieving overall gross margins exceeding 50% in 2020.\nWe continue to invest in the long-term future of ASML and increased R&D from EUR 1.1 billion in 2016 to EUR 1.26 billion in 2017. This increase was driven by accounting for a full year of HMI, our contributions to Zeiss SMT and our own investments in high NA. Overall R&D investments as a percentage of revenue decreased from about 16% in 2016 to about 14% in 2017. \nSG&A as a percentage of revenue were used by almost 1 percentage point to about 4.6% of revenue. Our net income for the full year grew 44% to a record of EUR 2.12 billion, resulting in a net margin of 23.4% and an EPS of EUR 4.93.\nSo I would like to turn to our expectations and guidance for the first quarter of 2018. We expect Q1 total net sales of around EUR 2.2 billion. As a reminder, we pulled approximately EUR 400 million from this quarter into Q4 2017. While we target to ship 4 EUV systems in the March quarter, we expect revenue recognition of about EUR 150 million for our EUV business. Overall, we do expect quarter-over-quarter revenue growth throughout 2018. We expect our Q1 Installed Base Management revenue to come in around EUR 600 million. \nGross margin for Q1 is expected to be between 47% and 48%. R&D expenses for Q1 will reflect continued accelerated investments in our portfolio and will come in at around EUR 350 million. SG&A is expected to come in at about EUR 115 million. We are excited about 2018, which will be a year of continued strong growth in revenue and profitability.  \nToday, we also announced a new share buyback program for 2018 and '19 of up to EUR 2.5 billion. We intend to cancel these shares after repurchase with the exception of up to 2.4 million shares, which will be used to cover employee share plans. Additionally, we also will propose a 17% increase in our dividend to EUR 1.40 per share at our Annual Shareholder Meeting, which takes place on April 25 in Veldhoven. The dividend payment is valued at around EUR 600 million.\nWith that, I would like to turn the call back over to you, Peter.\nExecutives: Thank you, Wolfgang. As Wolfgang highlighted, that we had another record year in 2017. The demand for our full product portfolio was very strong, and our business continues to perform very well. The strong demand in both logic and memory set new revenue records across both sectors in 2017. Expanding end market applications, IC device content growth, increasing litho intensity, all evidenced by our strong backlog, provide a good basis for this positive momentum to continue in 2018.\nMost others, but certainly due to high demand from the server market, DRAM system demand remained strong as our customers continue to migrate to sub-20 nanometer nodes. Advanced nodes are more litho-intensive and, thus, drive increased litho demand. In 3D NAND, litho demand is also strong as a number of customers continue to ramp through greenfield fabs scale vertically with so-called stack-of-stacks. Additional lithography is required to connect these stacks, which further drives up litho intensity. But adding the NAND opportunity to the DRAM business outlook for next year, we see another strong memory year ahead.\nLogic demand continues to be solid as customers ramp 10-nanometer and starts transition to the 7-nanometer node. Litho intensity continues to increase with migration to more advanced nodes with further growth with the adoption of EUV at 7-nanometers. EUV production ramp will accelerate in 2018 as customers are eager to realize the benefits of process simplification, cycle time reduction, yield improvement and ultimately resulting in cost benefits.\nIn regards to China, we set a new record for this region in 2017 with over EUR 700 million in revenue. In addition to strong demand from existing customers in the region, we're also planning to ship to 5 domestic customers in 2018 for both memory and logic applications. With continued ramp of fabs in China, both from domestic and nondomestic customers, we see a very clear growth opportunity in this region over the coming years.\nOn the ASML product side, let me start with an update on our EUV business. In EUV, we continue to make significant progress in 2017. We demonstrated all system specifications, including 125 wafers per hour while continuing to improve availability. Customer demand is strong, evidenced by public statements of their plans to introduce this technology with volume production starting in 2018. We booked 10 EUV orders in Q4, bringing our backlog to 28 systems in which we plan to shipment 22 in 2018. Shipment profile, however, will be back half-loaded as our plan's step-up improved rate will effectively only have an impact in the second half of 2018. Our EUV shipment plan beyond 2018 is unchanged with 30-plus in 2019 and 40-plus in 2020.\nIn Deep UV, we shipped a total of 161 new systems in 2017, which is a 21% increase from 2016. We were able to significantly boost output in support of our increased customer demand in both memory and logic. We also provided customers with an early access version of TWINSCAN NXT:2000, which is our most advanced immersion lithography system used for process development of the NXT node devices. As a sign of the continuously increasing maturity of the NXT platform, the NXT:2000 system already meets or exceeds all of its performance targets. With 3D NAND customers, we expanded our options portfolio. We addressed critical process challenges and delivery of improved performance. \nIn Holistic Lithography, we showed growth across the full portfolio of software and metrology products. We shipped our first jointly-developed product less than 1 year after closing of the HMI acquisition.  This product, ePfm5, the pattern fidelity metrology system that leverages HMI's high-resolution e-beam metrology with ASML's computational lithography technology. This product's high-resolution capability enables high capture rate of systematic patterning defects so customers can accelerate their yield learning curves and drive higher production yields. Both of these, we shipped our first EUV e-beam mask inspection system.\nAs to 2018, we continue to expect continued solid growth in both sales and profitability. Our high-level view of 2018 business is largely unchanged relative to comments that we made last quarter. While we were able to recognize an additional EUR 400 million of revenue in 2017, this could be seen as a pull-in from 2018, it will not impact our view of 2018 as it will be wholly compensated by increased Deep UV demand.\nIn summary, we had another record year in 2017 with 33% revenue growth and 44% net income growth over 2016, strong demand in both logic and memory set new records in 2017 and we expect both sectors to see continued growth in 2018, supported by increased EUV sales. Expanding end market applications, device IC content growth, increasing litho intensity, as evidenced by our record backlog, provide a strong indication that this positive momentum will continue in 2018. \nWith that, we will be happy to take your questions.\nExecutives: Thank you, Peter. The operator will instruct you momentarily on the protocol for the Q&A session. Beforehand, I'd like to ask that you kindly limit yourself to one question with one short follow-up, if necessary. This will allow us to get as many callers as possible. \nNow operator, do we have your final instructions and the first questions please?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Mr. Farhan Ahmad.\nAnalysts: This is Farhan Ahmad from Credit Suisse. My question is on EUV. You booked them, the system orders. Can you talk about the mix of customers within that? Is it coming from memory or foundry? And are there many multiple customers within that?\nExecutives: Yes. There are multiple customers. It is dominated by the logic side of our business, and that is also -- when we look at next year -- next year, we see sales increase in logic really driven by EUV, and the memory sales increase is driven by Deep UV.\nAnalysts: Got it. And then in terms of the linearity for the year, is there much change between memory and logic lengths in the year as first half, more memory demand, and second, more foundry, logic as some of the other companies have said?\nExecutives: Not on the Deep UV side and on EUV side. And on the EUV side, as mentioned in the prepared remarks, it will be a more back end-loaded.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mr. C.J. Muse.\nAnalysts: C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI. First question, I guess -- was hoping that you could discuss, Peter, what you're seeing in the supply chain on the EUV side. Would love to get an update in terms of optics and things like that and whether you're feeling better, same, worse in terms of you hitting that 30 tool target into the 2019 time frame?\nExecutives: Yes. I think with respect to my feeling, no changes. I think it's the same as we said last quarter. It has to do with the fact that the step-ups in capacity are really long lead time items. So this is not something that you change one quarter to the other. So the supply chain situation is what it is. And I think the 30 plus is limited, as we said before, by the supply chain, and the 40-plus is really when this supply chain can kick into the next steps. So no real change.\nAnalysts: Okay. And I guess as my follow-up, you got the gross margin higher year-over-year despite the nice tick higher in EUV shipments. So curious, if you think about non-EUV and growth in inspection and an uptick on the DUV side, is it fair to say that, overall, that part of your business can do roughly 53%, 54% gross margin through the year?\nExecutives: I wouldn't like to nail it down to an exact percentage. But if you look at both other businesses, so the Holistic Lithography business and the Deep UV business, you will see an increased mix towards the more powerful machines, and that has a positive effect on gross margins. Also, we continued to do a lot of very profitable upgrades. And then from a mix between Deep UV and Holistic Lithography, you will see also, the next 2 or 3 years, a continued mix towards Holistic Lithography, which will have a slightly higher mix in our overall revenue. And since this is a very software-driven, it structurally also contributes to the non-EUV business being up, so both effects. Both of these businesses go up based on the products that we offer, and then you also have a mix base effect. And that, of course, comes together with us making significant progress on the EUV. And that's why we feel confident that from the 45%, we can advance in 2018 and then get to our 50%-plus in 2020.\nExecutives: C.J., if I just may add 1 general comment on this is, going forward, I mean, we are guiding -- and as we did, we are guiding a corporate gross margin, and going forward, we will do that. Because if you look at what our customers really want from us is node-to-node transitions, and node-to-node transitions, going forward, are really a combination of the entire set of products and services that we are offering. So you will see agreements with our customers that involve EUV, Deep UV, Holistic and applications in one go, and we will make one PPA, which expects -- which effectively gives us one gross margin. So going forward, we will guide you more and more on the overall corporate gross margin because it doesn't make sense to give you -- and I don't want to do that either, to give you any specific gross margin guidance for those products because we have the PPAs for the entire product portfolio of ASML.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mr. Sandeep Deshpande.\nAnalysts: Sandeep Deshpande, JPMorgan. My first question is on EUV. Could you possibly help us understand? In terms of the recognition on EUV into 2018, are you going to be recognizing that in the all the tools on shipments by the second half of this year as well as the past deferred revenue on EUV will be fully recognized in 2018? And I have a quick follow-up on EUV as well.\nExecutives: Okay. Let me see whether I can structure this for you because there's a lot of moving parts here. The first comment is by the end of the year, we should be able to recognize the majority of the revenue of a system as we ship it. At the beginning of the year, we still have shipments, as you have heard from my prepared remarks. Q1, for instance, we're planning to ship 4 systems, recognizing only EUR 150 million. There are still shipments that have -- of tools that have changes in them that require us to  wait with revenue recognition for an acceptance of the tool at the customer side. So these Q1 shipments will, however, recognize in the second half of the year. On top of that, we are carrying a deferred revenue balance of around EUR 500 million on our balance sheet from prior shipments, and they're both short term and long term. So some of them will come into the P&L in 2018, and some will even carry a little bit into 2019. If you put it altogether, we expect the revenue for the EUV business to be somewhere in the EUR 2.3 billion range for the year. As a reminder, just so for clarification, we said EUR 2.5 billion in the last call. But of course, we achieved the acceptance of 2 tools already in 2017, and of course, they moved into 2017, where we overachieved by EUR 200 million. I hope that helps, Sandeep.\nAnalysts: Good. And then following up to your earlier response, Peter, regarding EUV for 2019. I mean, some of those very strong orders you talked in the fourth quarter are clearly 2019-related. How do you see -- I mean, the order basis for 2019, do you expect that because of your lead time, you'll get almost all the 2019-related EUV orders in this year itself? Or this is going to continue right through next year in terms of getting orders? And then -- had -- will you also start seeing a 2020 level of indication from customers for EUV?\nExecutives: Yes. I think what we're working on, and because it's also on customer request, is clearly a reduction of the cycle time of our EUV tools. I mean, it has to come down by 2020. We really like to be at the cycle time anywhere between 12 and 15 months. That means also customers will take account of that, and that means that they will actually postpone issuing the orders to reflect that reduced cycle time. Now the first cycle time reductions, we will probably see somewhere at the -- towards the end of 2018. But I would suspect that the majority, I think the significant majority of everything that we will ship in 2019 will be booked in 2018. These cycle time reductions will really take affect later, and that will then have an effect on the order -- lead time of our customers. So vast majority should be in this year.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mr. Amit Harchandani.\nAnalysts: Amit Harchandani from Citigroup. My first question would be with regards to the current traction you're seeing on the high NA EUV side. If you could update us on the same and as [indiscernible] on the context of your 2020 ambition. But clearly, the market is looking for some color or trajectory in terms of how revenues are likely to shape up beyond 2020, and high NA is a critical ingredient of the same. So would be great to know your thoughts on the same, and then I have a follow-up.\nExecutives: Yes. That's a good question. I think we have had extensive discussion with our customers on our high NA concept, and I mean, the -- how the machine looks like and the performance specifications that we started and already way into 2017. I think we got confirmation from all our major customers that high NA makes complete sense from a technical point of view, from an economical point of view. So they want us to execute on this. Now currently, we are in discussion with our customers under what terms and conditions we should start shipping the first R&D tools and how quickly after the R&D tools we should start ramping up for volume. Now having said that, we do realize that a high NA tool is really a new scanner. It's not so much a new EUV source. As you know, the EUV source being the main reason why there was a delay with the EUV introduction. We were using the same source as for the current EUV generation. So that means that we would be able to actually see a high-volume high NA EUV tools shipping somewhere in the middle of the next decade, starting to be used in the high-volume production and then ramping in the second half of the next decade. Now those will be tools that we're currently looking at pricing significantly, over to EUR 200 million. And that means that if you then look beyond the 2020 target number in terms of sales end, you don't need a lot of imagination to foresee our top line growing significantly beyond 2020, and it will be driven by EUV and the next generation.\nAnalysts: And -- it's an unrelated follow-up, if I could get some clarity around China. You've given us an idea of shipment to domestic customers in 2018. In the past, you've talked about the cumulative LIFO opportunity, if I remember correctly, of around EUR 3 billion. Could you give us a sense on -- have -- is your sentiment more positive, more negative? And how are you thinking about China over the next 2 to 3 years?\nExecutives: Yes. I think we actually mentioned that EUR 3 billion mark, but that takes into account, I think, our view as to the speed, realistic speed with which our domestic Chinese customers will be able to ramp their fabs and to get their products qualified. Now if they can do this faster, then you would probably see an uptick on that EUR 3 billion. And if they would do it, let's say, at a speed with which we would normally see in memory and logic, you could probably get to a number that's almost twice as high as the EUR 3 billion. But that is given the fact that many of these are greenfield -- not only greenfield, but also greenfield companies, and that's why we take a more conservative view. But I would say, let's stick to the EUR 3 billion, and let's work very closely, together with those customers, to see whether they can accelerate.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mr. Jagadish Iyer.\nAnalysts: Yes, Summit Redstone. Two questions, Peter. If you look at the foundry logic, if you look at calendar '17, there's not been a significant uptick in your revenue in foundry, logic segment. Whereas if you compare it to the memory, there's been a significant uptick there. So how should we think about growth in memory revenues in calendar '18? And is there a potential risk that these customers decide to scale back on capital spending if the pricing environment does not support such a situation? And I have a follow-up.\nExecutives: Yes. I think we've -- both for memory and logic, we see similar patterns in 2018 with -- there are some potential upside, which is customer-driven. I think that the second half of your question is probably more relevant one because it comes up time and time again. The way we look at this is are we creating an overcapacity in terms of the bit supply into the memory market, both DRAM and the NAND. Now if we look at what our customers are currently asking us and the forecast that they gave is what they want in 2018 as your question not fully yet in the backlog. And if we take that and we take into account the nodes that they want to use this on, the effect it will have on the bit density, then we can calculate what the capacity addition will be in terms of bits. And in DRAM, where we will be probably anywhere -- let's say, mid-20s max, yes? So anywhere between 22% to 25%. And in NAND, the capacity addition of what we can see based on litho will be around mid-40s. And these are -- wait, currently our customers have talked about and the analysts are talking about it, it's about the same as the demand bit growth looks like. So when we take those 2 together and we look at the capability of the lithography machines to add bits, it seems that it's pretty much in balance. So is there a risk? There's always a risk because it's about the end markets, it's about the global economy. But from where we are today, we don't see that as a major issue.\nAnalysts: Okay. And then I have a follow-up. So you talked about EUV, and you talked about 125 wafers an hour. On a high level, can you kind of quantify in calendar '17 in terms of your progress, in terms of productivity of it and availability? And what should be the milestone for calendar '18 -- not quarter-to-quarter variation, but just on an overall annual level milestones?\nExecutives: Yes. You have to realize that nobody has EUV in full production yet. I mean, it's all coming out of the development phase. So they're qualifying product, which actually means nobody runs 125 wafers per hour continuously. I mean, we're not there. We'll actually start in the back half of 2018, but that capability is actually there. And [indiscernible] tests that are being done by customers and by us, they'll show us that capability. Now with respect to the availability with the 3400, we're over 80%. We seek significantly over 80%. And I think the target by the end of this year will be that the availability numbers are such that customers feel comfortable to put the tools into production that will give them around 1,500, maximum 2,000 wafers per day. And that is then a result of 125 wafers per hour, on average and availability and the -- let's say, in active hours that customers are planning for their own production. So that part of [indiscernible] out to 2,000 wafers per day, that is what we're focusing on, and that seems very feasible with everything we have on the table today, which I think is evidenced by the fact that customers are giving us orders. We got 10 orders in Q4.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mr. Dave Mulholland.\nAnalysts: It's David Mulholland from UBS. Firstly, one of the strengths in the quarter was clearly the memory bookings. And I wonder if you could just help us understand how that breaks down in the quarter for as much visibility as you have between DRAM and NAND and how that's changed versus Q3 and also how much of it's coming from China at this stage. And then I've got a follow up.\nExecutives: Yes. To answer the last part, China, of course, we have greenfield fabs there. They don't go into ramp, like I said, in -- as an answer to an earlier question, are going to ramp up with the same speed as the mature memory companies. So they will take those tools and will use those tools to create a first line where they can qualify their product. So it will be -- it is in there in terms of the bookings. Now split between DRAM and NAND is very difficult for the simple reason that customers are continuously assessing how to allocate their lithography capabilities and their capacity between DRAM and between NAND, and there are a lot of relocations going on between DRAM and NAND. That's why some time ago, we decided to just give you the memory segment as one segment and also between DRAM and NAND because they are continuously changing because of those -- the reallocations.\nAnalysts: That's clear. And then just on the follow-up. One of the comments you made was, obviously, 2 tools being recognized earlier in Q4. I just wondered if you can give us some clarity on what drove that. Was it the customer lowering the performance requirement they got either earlier? Or was it better performance on your side in terms of getting to the targets quicker?\nExecutives: It was because the customer signed off on the specification that we agreed when we shipped the tool. So no better or worse specification, just we met the specification in the sign-off.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mr. Jerome Ramel.\nAnalysts: Yes. Jerome Ramel, Exane BNP Paribas. One quick question on EUV. Can you update us on the mask inspection and pellicles?\nExecutives: Okay. Mask inspection, well, we shipped the first e-beam mask inspection tool through our HMI subsidiary. Mask, in itself, as we also showed in the presentation this morning, whether you have the excess -- but at least, we show we make significant progress on the pellicle development. So -- let's say pellicles are now able to be used at the 250-watt power level. Lifetime of pellicles is going up. We're all moving very nicely into the volume production area. And so masks and the mask infrastructure, we don't think there's any issue that will prevent our customers to put EUV into volume production in the course of the year.\nAnalysts: And another follow-up on the high NA EUV. Some of your potential client made a comment that they might need to build new fabs to go with the new tools. Is that the reason you are sharing? The question is, can we eventually use high NA EUV in existing fabs? Or do we have the redesign the fabs?\nExecutives: Well, I think it's similar to the current EUV tool. I mean, when we [indiscernible] 5 years ago, the current EUV tool did not fit into many of the fabs at that moment in time. I mean, it's a better fab height. It's the strength of the floor. It's -- those are bigger tools. But this is -- as long as we -- and this is why we have such a coordinated and very detailed interaction with our customers on the high NA is also make sure that they understand the full specification sets, not only from a lithography point of view, but also from logistics and a facility management point of view. That's been communicated, and I hope customers will build new fabs, not only because high NA, because the market is growing and we need more of those devices. And I think that was the main reason why we start building new fabs and then take into account that's all the tools are a bit bigger.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mr. Douglas Smith.\nAnalysts: Great quarter, by the way. I noticed that the dry EUV moved up from 20 units to 25 units, Q3 to Q4, but the immersion went from 22 to 20. Is that evidence of the increasing importance of NAND in your portfolio?\nExecutives: No. I think to draw conclusions on the quarter-to-quarter comparison between Q3 and Q4 is -- I think you probably shouldn't do that because it's -- it could be all kinds of incidental factors, customer-specific shipments. But generally, I would say that the dry Deep UV systems are going up in numbers going forward, because, yes, you are absolutely correct, there is a higher need in the 3D NAND space. Now it's not only because the 3D NAND space grows, but it's for different reasons. One, we use stacks-of-stacks, like I said in my prepared comments, which actually means you need extra little steps to connect those stacks. That is one. But also there is -- there are specific requirements that we need to put there as dry tools because there are peculiarities, I could say, with the 3D NAND manufacturing, which have to do with what wafers, which have to do with opaque layers so that the alignment needs to be different. And all those specific peculiarities of 3D NAND will be addressed by us by bringing out the tools and options on the tools that will enable our customers to increase their yields and to make sure that they can do effective 3D NAND production.\nAnalysts: Got it. On a kind of related issue, I was wondering, are you seeing any evidence yet that with the traction of EUV, customers might be planning on ordering fewer immersion systems, which I guess is kind the whole point of introducing EUV in the longer term?\nExecutives: Yes. I think -- what I think, it's probably best is we look at our Analyst Day of 2016. We gave you a couple of scenarios where high EUV introduction, lower EUV introduction for several reasons. It could be EUV not as effective as we then, at that moment in time, planned or whether markets were different. And you can actually conclude from those scenarios that higher EUV will lead to somewhat lower immersion, but still significant. And it's logical because it will cannibalize some of the multiple patterning layers. On the other hand also, layers are growing, no? So it also -- so basically, there is a dilutive effect in that sense that you have more [indiscernible] layers, and some of those layers will be deep UV layers, will be the immersion layers. So no matter how you look at it, the number of EUV and of immersion systems will still remain significant, also with high EUV introduction. So -- this is I'd like to refer back to that -- to those 4 scenarios that we showed in the end of 2016.\nExecutives: And just to give you the numbers, I mean, these 4 scenarios, at anything between 50 and 80 tools. And that -- right in the middle of that range, around 70, is what we're shipping right now. It's not -- in no case it is going down significantly.\nAnalysts: Right. So it's that you're saying it's too early, really, to judge the level of cannibalization of EUV to immersion?\nExecutives: Yes. There will be probably some. I mean, if we now look at a quite -- at a good EUV adoption, which is -- I think is a realistic assumption right now, then yes, there will be some effect on immersion tools. But it's not going to be significant.\nExecutives: I think, by the way, that if you look at over the lifetime, over a very long period, it's actually not cannibalizing immersion at all because EUV, at one point in -- without EUV at one point in time, there wouldn't be even new nodes. And if there's a new node, there will also always be layers for immersion. So if you don't get it at a very long period of time, it's actually not cannibalizing at all. It's actually keeping it alive.\nAnalysts: Yes, that's a good point.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini.\nAnalysts: Yes. Mehdi Hosseini from Susquehanna International. A couple of follow-up. Peter, how should I think about your DRAM customers that are planning for EUV? Would that take for you to hit that 2,000 wafer per-day target before you see a step-up in booking activity? Or is there any other metric that I need to track? And any insight here would be great. And I have a couple of follow-ups.\nExecutives: Yes. I think it's not a surprise that DRAM devices are more cost sensitive than the advanced logic. So it is true that the 2,000 wafers per day is -- we've said it before, is a realistic economic productivity target. I think if we meet that target or, let's say, on a continuous basis, it's our assessment that, that will be a very attractive economic entry point for DRAM. Now -- and how realistic is 2,000 wafers per day? With everything that we have on the road map today, I think it is realistic to be there by the end of the year. So now, that -- let's work very hard and execute on it and work very closely, together with our customers, to get to that point because that, of course, it will be only for a very few layers, but there's a lot of DRAM wafers. So that could give an extra impetus to our EUV story.\nAnalysts: Sure. Now I wanted to reconcile this with large-source capacity. How long will it take for Zeiss to add additional capacity? Do you have any flexibility to accelerate investment there or accelerate capacity, manufacturing capacity so that your 30-plus target for 2019 could increase? And I'm asking you this because if you're able to increase confidence among your DRAM customers that you can actually do 2,000 wafers per day, wouldn't they need to place a PO before '19? And wouldn't some of these EUV shipment would have to take place into DRAM customer by late '19? So doesn't that create a kind of a double-edged sword? And I want to get your view on the kind of levers that you can pull to accommodate these DRAM customers.\nExecutives: Yes. It's -- you're making -- you're asking very elaborate question, and I'll give you a very simple answer. The way that we -- the lead time to increase capacity at Zeiss has lapsed. I mean, we are where we are today. The only way to get 30 plus and how much the plus is, is dependent on the cycle time reduction in the factory of Zeiss. The faster they can do that and the better they can do that, the more we can squeeze out. Because everything else, our long lead [indiscernible] in terms of capacities, buildings, machines, people, training, the whole thing, that will not happen until 2020 and our output in 2020, which is their output in 2019. So that means we have what we have, no? And that also means we are very transparent to our customers on the 2019 potential shipment plan and when those machines will come available. We're very transparent to every customer, and it's up to them to decide whether they want to take up that capacity. And there's very little we can do other than just working very hard with our Zeiss colleagues to keep reducing the cycle time to squeeze out a few extra. But that's what it is, and it's up to the customers to react on the transparency that we will give them.\nExecutives: And probably 2 clarifications, just in case I got your questions wrong. So you refer to the light source. Of course, the light source is not done at Zeiss. It's the optical system. And secondly, you seem to imply that DRAM EUV shipments would start late in 2019. We are already shipping EUV systems now. So I mean, it will also be in DRAM in high-volume manufacturing in 2019. Just so that's clear.\nAnalysts: Does the elaborate question give me a quick follow-up?\nExecutives: Yes, because [indiscernible] -- and we know it's your [indiscernible] -- for your [indiscernible] of time [indiscernible].\nAnalysts: Okay, great. You -- many interesting point about the e-beam mask inspection. You said that you have already shipped your first tool. How should we think about a year or 2 from now? Should we assume that you actually can turn this into a volume production and actually help customers meet the inspection or mask inspection without relying on other vendors?\nExecutives: Well, yes. It's a fully equipped mask inspection tool. So it's an e-beam tool, can be used for e-beam mask inspection. And the more EUVs is used in terms of layers, the more mask inspection tools are needed. So I think we just are going to deliver and ship it in that market, and yes, it's what it is. And I think when we did the HMI acquisition last year, I think we also put a date, the year before in 2016. I think we did discuss the opportunity of e-beam mask inspection as a couple of hundred million euros of -- this is -- it is where it is, and I think the success of EUV will, of course, help us also penetrate that market.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ms. Tammy Qiu.\nAnalysts: Tammy Qiu from Berenberg. So the first question is on the cycle. I understand that based on your comment, 2018 is likely to be a nice year. I'm just wondering what's your view on 2019 and what kind of should be the end market driver there.\nExecutives: Well, I've just sold my crystal ball, so I can't -- I really can't answer this, but it all depends on the end markets. I mean, the [indiscernible] -- but just a more high-level answer is the proliferation and the penetration of IC devices into almost everything now is -- it actually makes it more volatile, I think, macroeconomics swings. So you want to talk about cycles, I think there will be macroeconomic cycles. I said it in the press conference this morning also, and -- but when that happens, I don't know, yes? The only thing is when it happens, we will be able to react up or down. And in your case, you seem to communicate what's the possibility of a downward question, I don't know. But when it happens, we have all the means and the flexibility to react.\nAnalysts: Okay. And the second question is you talked about the EUV weren't actually limit the demand for Deep UV. So in general, I would say, does that mean equipment have to become more and more expensive for the chip makers over time, so therefore they will have to keep buying the more expansive and more equipment for making a leading [indiscernible]? So I'm not sure how you view this point. Do you, as an equipment maker, need to cut the price at certain point so that they don't have to pay crazy CapEx order time? Or can they actually pass on the incremental CapEx to their customers?\nExecutives: Well, what you're basically asking is, is Moore's Law still viable, yes? Because when I just -- well, just before the press conference, I bumped into one of the really senior [ aides ] at [ met lab ], and he said, \"You know, this is great where the company is going. I still remember sending out the first invoice for $1 million. Now we're selling EUR 120 million tool.\" So to your point, yes, customers have started to pay a lot more for those tools. But of course, the transition and the cost per function has continuously gone down on a logarithmic scale, no? So is Moore's Law viable? Yes, we believe it's still viable, and yes, our customers will pay higher price for our change whereby the cost per function will keep going down.\nOperator: The next question will come from Mr. Andrew Gardiner.\nAnalysts: It's Andrew Gardiner from Barclays. We spent quite a bit of time talking about memory this afternoon. I was just wondering if we could spend a minute or 2 on logic and just in terms of the -- first on the near-term thinking through 2018 and the sort of strength or sort of node migration plans in place there. How do you view your sort of visibility into that logic business this year? I presume it's better or sort of firmer than we see in memory, where you seem to be highlighting the potential risk in the back half or, at least, lack of visibility in the back half. But how -- so where's your conviction level or -- to where a customer sort of order rates in terms of the 10 and 7 nanometer migrations?\nExecutives: Yes. I think what we've -- we haven't changed our view as compared to  1 or 2 quarters ago. I mean, the logic 10-nanometer ramp is still going, actually, to the areas in China, where we're shipping 14 and 28. And more importantly, I think what we will see is by the back half of the year, we'll start to see EUV going into 7-nanometer pilot production. This ramp, I think -- and also, if you look at the comments made by our customers and their assessment of the size of the nodes, there is no reason whatsoever to believe that they -- that there is an indication that those nodes will actually dwindle in terms of number of wafers that they would need to build that capacity. And on the contrary, I think comments are being made by customers on the 7 and 10-nanometer nodes as being very large nodes, and they're seeing a lot [indiscernible]. So there is no indication whatsoever to change our view. And like I said earlier and we look at the memory and the logic business, we see in 2018 developing at least at the same level as 2017 for both logic and memory with some upside here and there.\nAnalysts: Okay. If I could just have a quick sort of accounting follow-up for Wolfgang. We're starting to see the sort of the Zeiss investment come through in terms of the equity income line. It was somewhat negative in the fourth quarter. Is there a rough rule of thumb we should be thinking of as we put that in our models for future periods?\nExecutives: Yes. The -- first of all for everybody, we had 2 agreements with Zeiss: one was a high NA investment agreement and one was an equity agreement. The high NA one, obviously, goes through our R&D line and also through our balance sheet as it relates to the CapEx. But as it relates to the equity investment, you will see that equity method investment on the balance sheet of about EUR 1 billion for the 24.9% that we own, and then you see 2 elements in our financial statements. First of all, you see in the P&L a profit that's attributed to those 24.9%, and therefore, the first quarter, you saw a negative EUR 17 million. And the second thing that you see is in our cash flow from investing. You see the dividend attributed to that investment, and you see that we received a dividend also for 3 months period of almost EUR 20 million. So the dividend is basically, since SMT basically distributes their earnings, a very good reflection of the profitability of that business. Now accounting makes this a little bit complicated because you need to do numerous things, but you start from a very healthy profit. And then you start off with, number one, the adjustment from IFRS to U.S. GAAP. Number two, you adjust for differences in accounting policies between the companies. But then number three is where it really hits you. Even though it's not an acquisition, you still need to do purchase price accounting. That means you need to write up the inventory to the fair market value. You need to identify intangibles. And then you do the same thing what you have heard us talking about when we talked about HMI, you need to consume that inventory and you need to amortized these intangibles. And that takes your profit all the way to 17 million [indiscernible]. Now as it relates to the future, this is something that will still be with us for a long time because this intangible has a lifetime of 15 years plus. But the inventory part, we will walk through within a year or so. So I think, net-net for 2018, this will still be a loss. And then in 2019, you will also see a profit on that line and then depreciate. And the cash, of course, follows the true profit and cash flow of SMT. And from a cash flow perspective, you should see a much, much higher number every year.\nAnalysts: It wasn't such a good follow-up, sorry.\nExecutives: Yes, good one [ end though ]. Ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one last question. If you are unable to get through on this call and still have questions, please feel free to contact the ASML Investor Relations department with your question. Now operator, may we have the last caller please?\nOperator: The final question will come from Mr. Robert Sanders.\nAnalysts: It's Deutsche Bank. I just had a last question on the EUV backlog. Just in terms of how many of those 28 tools are with the planned 251 configuration as opposed to -- I think it's 205 of the standard tool? And I have a follow-up.\nExecutives: All of them, because there will be -- even if it's -- we have the commitment to have all those tool ultimately to be at -- toward the 251. But -- so in fact, they're all at the 251 configuration.\nAnalysts: I got it. So all of them will have an extra amount of money to be billed to the customer once you get up to the 251 because that's beyond the spec, right?\nExecutives: [indiscernible] because the spec is we need to do 251 to get the 125 wafers. So when we get over 251, we get more wafers out there, we get extra money. But 125 wafers is what we sold to them.\nAnalysts: Okay. And just last question for Wolfgang, just on the gross margin in 2018. Given what you said about being higher than, I think, 45%, is 45% to 46% a kind of good model number for our models for 2018? You can just give us a vague range, that'd be great.\nExecutives: I think we would have knocked the result if it's only extremely marginal, but I don't want to tie it down to a specific number at this point either. So we'll go through the year. And the more important thing is it will be a good step forward towards the 50 plus in 2020. That's really what we're for.\nExecutives: Now on behalf of the ASML or the management, I would like to thank you all for joining us today. \nOperator, if you could formally conclude the call, I'd appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the ASML 2017 Fourth Quarter and Annual Financial Results Conference Call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the ASML 2017 Fourth Quarter and Annual Financial Results Conference Call on January 17, 2018. [Operator Instructions] \nI would now like to open the question-and-answer queue. [Operator Instructions] \nI would now like to turn the conference call over to Mr. Skip Miller. Go ahead, please, sir.\nExecutives: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, good morning, ladies and gentlemen. This is Skip Miller, Vice President of Investor Relations at ASML. Joining me today from ASML headquarters in Veldhoven in Netherlands is ASML CEO, Peter Wennink; and CFO, Wolfgang Nickl. \nThe subject of today's call is ASML's 2017 fourth quarter and annual results. The length of this call will be 60 minutes, and questions will be taken in the order that they are received. This call is also being broadcast live over the Internet at asml.com. A transcript of management's opening remarks and a replay of the call will be available on our website shortly following the conclusion of this call.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to caution listeners that comments made by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements involve material risks and uncertainties. For a discussion of risk factors, I encourage you to review the safe harbor statement contained in today's press release and presentation found on our website at asml.com and in ASML's annual report on Form 20-F and other documents as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to Peter Wennink for a brief introduction.\nExecutives: Thank you, Skip. Good morning and good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining us for our Fourth Quarter and 2017 Annual Results Conference Call. \nBefore we begin the question-and-answer session, Wolfgang and I would like to provide you with an overview and some commentary on the fourth quarter and the full year 2017 as well as provide our view of the coming quarters. Wolfgang will start with a review of our fourth quarter financial performance with the -- some added comments on our short-term outlook, and I will complete the introduction with some additional comments on the current business environment and our future business outlook. \nThank you.\nExecutives: Thank you, Peter, and welcome, everyone. I will first highlight some of the fourth quarter and full year financial accomplishments and then provide our guidance for the first quarter of 2018. \nQ4 net sales came in at EUR 2.56 billion, exceeding our guidance by over EUR 400 million. Due to demand strength, some customers requested earlier shipments of lithography systems, which we were able to accommodate late in the quarter. This accounted for almost half of the EUR 400 million, and the other half came from earlier-than-expected acceptance of the performance of 2 previously shipped EUV systems by a customer, which led to recognition of deferred revenue in Q4. Net system sales of EUR 1.95 billion was strengthened by memory, which contributed 53% of sales, foundry accounted for 29% and IDM was 18% of system sales. Installed Base Management sales for the quarter came in at EUR 606 million, which was in line with our guidance. \nGross margin for the quarter came in at 45.2%, which was 120 basis points higher than our guidance. This was the result of much stronger-than-expected DUV sales, more than offsetting the dilutive effect from incremental EUV revenue that was recognized during the quarter. Overall OpEx came in slightly above guidance, with R&D expenses at EUR 317 million and SG&A expenses at EUR 113 million. \nTurning to the balance sheet. Quarter-over-quarter cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments came in at EUR 3.29 billion. During the quarter, we purchased approximately EUR 331 million worth of shares. Since January 2016, we have purchased a total of approximately 8.2 million shares with a value of EUR 900 million against our 2016 and '17 authorization of EUR 1.5 billion.\nMoving on to the order book. Q4 systems bookings came in at a strong EUR 2.93 billion. This is almost an EUR 800 million increase compared to Q3 bookings. The order intake was driven by the memory sector, representing 55% of orders, compared to 30% for foundry and 15% for IDM. We took 10 new orders for EUV systems, and our EUV backlog now reflects 28 systems valued at EUR 3.1 billion. Our overall system backlog now totals a record EUR 6.68 billion and is balanced nicely between memory, foundry and IDM.\nOur strong Q4 results marked the closure of an exceptional year for the industry and ASML. For the full year, our net sales grew 33% to a record of EUR 9.05 billion. Net Installed Base Management sales grew more than 25% to a record of EUR 2.68 billion. With total EUV sales almost at EUR 1.2 billion, 2017 was the year when preparations for inserting EUV into high-volume chip manufacturing shifted into a higher gear. Of the 12 EUV shipments planned for 2017, we shipped 10 during the year. One shipment is in progress, and one shipment is planned this month. This means that our 2018 shipment plan will increase by 2 to a total of 22 systems.\nWe made considerable improvements on our EUV gross margin in 2017, achieving 0% in the fourth quarter. Due to accelerated investments in EUV service infrastructure, we had not achieved 0% for the full year. Nevertheless, even with a more than 3x increase in EUV revenue from 2016 to 2017, we were able to improve our corporate gross margin to 45%. We are on track to achieving overall gross margins exceeding 50% in 2020.\nWe continue to invest in the long-term future of ASML, and increased R&D from EUR 1.1 billion in 2016 to EUR 1.26 billion in 2017. This increase was driven by accounting for a full year of HMI, our contributions to Zeiss SMT and our own investments in high NA. Overall R&D investments as a percentage of revenue decreased from about 16% in 2016 to about 14% in 2017. \nSG&A as a percentage of revenue reduced by almost 1 percentage point to about 4.6% of revenue. Our net income for the full year grew 44% to a record of EUR 2.12 billion, resulting in a net margin of 23.4% and an EPS of EUR 4.93.\nWith that, I would like to turn to our expectations and guidance for the first quarter of 2018. We expect Q1 total net sales of around EUR 2.2 billion. As a reminder, we pulled approximately EUR 400 million from this quarter into Q4 2017. While we target to ship 4 EUV systems in the March quarter, we expect revenue recognition of about EUR 150 million for all EUV business. Overall, we do expect quarter-over-quarter revenue growth throughout 2018. We expect our Q1 Installed Base Management revenue to come in around EUR 600 million. \nGross margin for Q1 is expected to be between 47% and 48%. R&D expenses for Q1 will reflect continued accelerated investments in our portfolio and will come in at around EUR 350 million. SG&A is expected to come in at about EUR 115 million. We are excited about 2018, which will be a year of continued strong growth in revenue and profitability.  \nToday, we also announced a new share buyback program for 2018 and '19 of up to EUR 2.5 billion. We intend to cancel these shares after repurchase with the exception of up to 2.4 million shares, which will be used to cover employee share plans. Additionally, we also will propose a 17% increase in our dividend to EUR 1.40 per share at our Annual Shareholder Meeting, which takes place on April 25 in Veldhoven. The dividend payment is valued at around EUR 600 million.\nWith that, I would like to turn the call back over to you, Peter.\nExecutives: Thank you, Wolfgang. As Wolfgang highlighted, that we had another record year in 2017. The demand for our full product portfolio was very strong, and our business continues to perform very well. The strong demand in both logic and memory set new revenue records across both sectors in 2017. Expanding end market applications, IC device content growth, increasing litho intensity, all evidenced by our strong backlog, provide a good basis for this positive momentum to continue in 2018.\nMost others, but certainly due to high demand from the server market, DRAM system demand remained strong as our customers continue to migrate to sub-20 nanometer nodes. Advanced nodes are more litho-intensive and, thus, drive increased litho demand. In 3D NAND, litho demand is also strong, as a number of customers continue to ramp through greenfield fabs and scale vertically with so-called stack-of-stacks. Additional lithography is required to connect these stacks, which further drives up litho intensity. But adding the NAND opportunity to the DRAM business outlook for next year, we see another strong memory year ahead.\nLogic demand continues to be solid as customers ramp 10-nanometer and starts transition to the 7-nanometer node. Litho intensity continues to increase with migration to more advanced nodes with further growth with the adoption of EUV at 7-nanometers. EUV production ramp will accelerate in 2018 as customers are eager to realize the benefits of process simplification, cycle time reduction, yield improvement and ultimately resulting in cost benefits.\nIn regards to China, we set a new record for this region in 2017 with over EUR 700 million in revenue. In addition to strong demand from existing customers in the region, we're also planning to ship to 5 domestic Chinese customers in 2018 for both memory and logic applications. With continued ramp of fabs in China, both from domestic and nondomestic customers, we see a very clear growth opportunity in this region over the coming years.\nOn the ASML product side, let me start with an update on our EUV business. In EUV, we continued to make significant progress in 2017. We demonstrated all system specifications, including 125 wafers per hour, while continuing to improve availability. Customer demand is strong, evidenced by public statements of their plans to introduce this technology, with volume production starting in 2018. We booked 10 EUV orders in Q4, bringing our backlog to 28 systems in which we plan to shipment 22 in 2018. Shipment profile, however, will be back half-loaded as our planned step-up in move rate will effectively only have an impact in the second half of 2018. Our EUV shipment plan beyond 2018 is unchanged with 30-plus in 2019 and 40-plus in 2020.\nIn Deep UV, we shipped a total of 161 new systems in 2017, which is a 21% increase from 2016. We were able to significantly boost output in support of our increased customer demand in both memory and logic. We also provided customers with an early access version of TWINSCAN NXT:2000, which is our most advanced immersion lithography system. It's used for process development of the NXT node devices. As a sign of the continuously increasing maturity of the NXT platform, the NXT:2000 system already meets or exceeds all of its performance targets. With 3D NAND customers, we expanded our options portfolio. We addressed critical process challenges and delivery of improved performance. \nIn Holistic Lithography, we showed growth across the full portfolio of software and metrology products. We shipped our first jointly-developed product less than 1 year after closing of the HMI acquisition.  This product, ePfm5, the pattern fidelity metrology system that leverages HMI's high-resolution e-beam metrology with ASML's computational lithography technology. This product's high-resolution capability enables high capture rate of systematic patterning defects so customers can accelerate their yield learning curves and drive higher production yields. Both of these, we shipped our first EUV e-beam mask inspection system.\nAs to 2018, we expect continued solid growth in both sales and profitability. Our high-level view of 2018 business is largely unchanged relative to comments that we made last quarter. While we were able to recognize an additional EUR 400 million of revenue in 2017, which could be seen as a pull-in from 2018, it will not impact our view of 2018 as it will be wholly compensated by increased Deep UV demand.\nIn summary, we had another record year in 2017 with 33% revenue growth and 44% net income growth over 2016, strong demand in both logic and memory set new revenue records in 2017, and we expect both sectors to see continued growth in 2018, supported by increased EUV sales. Expanding end market applications, device IC content growth, increasing litho intensity, as evidenced by our record backlog, provide a strong indication that this positive momentum will continue in 2018. \nWith that, we will be happy to take your questions.\nExecutives: Thank you, Peter. [Operator Instructions]\nNow operator, do we have your final instruction and 10 first questions, please?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Mr. Farhan Ahmad.\nAnalysts: This is Farhan Ahmad from Credit Suisse. My question is on EUV. You booked them, the system orders. Can you talk about the mix of customers within that? Is it coming from memory or foundry? And are there many multiple customers within that?\nExecutives: Yes. There are multiple customers. It is dominated by the logic side of our business, and that is also -- when we look at next year, next year, we see sales increase in logic really driven by EUV, and the memory sales increase is driven by Deep UV.\nAnalysts: Got it. And then in terms of the linearity for the year, is there much change between memory and logic lengths in the year as first half, more memory demand, and second, more foundry logic as some of the other companies have said?\nExecutives: Not on the Deep UV side and on EUV side. And on the EUV side, as mentioned in the prepared remarks, it will be a more back end-loaded.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mr. C.J. Muse.\nAnalysts: C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI. First question, I guess -- was hoping that you could discuss, Peter, what you're seeing in the supply chain on the EUV side. Would love to get an update in terms of optics and things like that and whether you're feeling better, same, worse in terms of hitting that 30 tool target into the 2019 time frame?\nExecutives: Yes. I think with respect to my feeling, no changes. I think it's the same as we said last quarter. It has to do with the fact that the step-ups in capacity are really long lead time items. So this is not something that you change one quarter to the other. So the supply chain situation is what it is. And I think the 30-plus is limited, as we said before, by the supply chain, and the 40-plus is really when this supply chain can kick into the next steps. So no real change.\nAnalysts: Okay. And I guess as my follow-up, you guided gross margin higher year-over-year despite the nice tick higher in EUV shipments. So curious, if you think about non-EUV and growth in inspection and an uptick on the DUV side, is it fair to say that, overall, that part of your business can do roughly 53%, 54% gross margin through the year?\nExecutives: I wouldn't like to nail it down to an exact percentage. But if you look at both other businesses, so the Holistic Lithography business and the Deep UV business, you will see an increased mix towards the more powerful machines, and that has a positive effect on gross margins. Also, we continue to do a lot of very profitable upgrades. And then from a mix between Deep UV and Holistic Lithography, you will see also, the next 2 or 3 years, a continued mix towards Holistic Lithography, which will have a slightly higher mix in our overall revenue. And since this is a very software-driven, it structurally also contributes to the non-EUV business being up, so both effects. Both of these businesses go up based on the products that we offer, and then you also have a mix base effect. And that, of course, comes together with us making significant progress on the EUV. And that's why we feel confident that from the 45%, we can advance in 2018 and then get to our 50%-plus in 2020.\nExecutives: C.J., if I just may add one general comment on this is, going forward, I mean, we are guiding -- and as we did, we are guiding a corporate gross margin, and going forward, we will do that. Because if you look at what our customers really want from us is node-to-node transitions, and node-to-node transitions, going forward, are really a combination of the entire set of products and services that we are offering. So you will see agreements with our customers that involve EUV, Deep UV, Holistic and applications in one go, and we will make one PPA, which expects -- which effectively gives us one gross margin. So going forward, we will guide you more and more on the overall corporate gross margin because it doesn't make sense to give you -- and I don't want to do that either, to give you any specific gross margin guidance for those products because we have the PPAs for the entire product portfolio of ASML.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mr. Sandeep Deshpande.\nAnalysts: Sandeep Deshpande, JPMorgan. My first question is on EUV. Could you possibly help us understand in terms of the recognition on EUV into 2018, are you going to be recognizing that in all the tools on shipments by the second half of this year as well as the past deferred revenue on EUV will be fully recognized in 2018? And I have a quick follow-up on EUV as well.\nExecutives: Okay. Let me see whether I can structure this for you because there's a lot of moving parts here. The first comment is by the end of the year, we should be able to recognize the majority of the revenue of a system as we ship it. At the beginning of the year, we still have shipments, as you have heard from my prepared remarks. Q1, for instance, we're planning to ship 4 systems, recognizing only EUR 150 million. There are still shipments that have -- of tools that have changes in them that require us to wait with revenue recognition for an acceptance of the tool at the customer side. So these Q1 shipments will, however, recognize in the second half of the year. On top of that, we are carrying a deferred revenue balance of around EUR 500 million on our balance sheet from prior shipments, and they're both short term and long term. So some of them will come into the P&L in 2018, and some will even carry a little bit into 2019. If you put it altogether, we expect the revenue for the EUV business to be somewhere in the EUR 2.3 billion range for the year. As a reminder, just so for clarification, we said EUR 2.5 billion in the last call. But of course, we achieved the acceptance of 2 tools already in 2017, and of course, they moved into 2017, where we overachieved by EUR 200 million. I hope that helps, Sandeep.\nAnalysts: Good. And then following up to your earlier response, Peter, regarding EUV for 2019. I mean, some of those very strong orders you talked in the fourth quarter are clearly 2019-related. How do you see -- I mean, the order [ bearing ] for 2019, do you expect that because of your lead time, you'll get almost all the 2019-related EUV orders in this year itself? Or this is going to continue right through next year in terms of getting orders? And then -- had -- will you also start seeing a 2020 level of indication from customers for EUV?\nExecutives: Yes. I think what we're working on, and because it's also on customer request, is clearly a reduction of the cycle time of our EUV tools. I mean, it has to come down by 2020. We really like to be at the cycle time anywhere between 12 and 15 months. That means also customers will take account of that, and that means that they will actually postpone issuing the orders to reflect that reduced cycle time. Now the first cycle time reductions, we will probably see somewhere at the -- towards the end of 2018. But I would suspect that the majority, I think the significant majority of everything that we will ship in 2019 will be booked in 2018, because these cycle time reductions will really take effect later, and that will then have an effect on the order lead time of our customers. So vast majority should be in this year.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mr. Amit Harchandani.\nAnalysts: Amit Harchandani from Citigroup. My first question would be with regards to the current traction you're seeing on the high NA EUV side. If you could please update us on the same, and I say so in the context of your 2020 ambition, but clearly the market is looking for some color or trajectory in terms of how revenues are likely to shape up beyond 2020, and high NA is a critical ingredient of the same. So would be great to know your thoughts on the same, and then I have a follow-up.\nExecutives: Yes. That's a good question. I think we have had extensive discussion with our customers on our high NA concept, and I mean, the -- how the machine looks like and the performance specifications that we started and already way into 2017. I think we got confirmation from all our major customers that high NA makes complete sense from a technical point of view, from an economical point of view. So they want us to execute on this. Now currently, we are in discussion with our customers under what terms and conditions we should start shipping the first R&D tools and how quickly after the R&D tools we should start ramping up for volume. Now having said that, we do realize that a high NA tool is really a new scanner. It's not so much a new EUV source. As you know, the EUV source being the main reason why there was a delay with the EUV introduction. We were using the same source as for the current EUV generation. So that means that we would be able to actually see a high-volume high NA EUV tools shipping somewhere in the middle of the next decade, starting to be used in the high-volume production and then ramping in the second half of the next decade. Now those will be tools that we're currently looking at pricing significantly over EUR 200 million. And that means that if you then look beyond the 2020 target number in terms of sales end, you don't need a lot of imagination to foresee our top line growing significantly beyond 2020, and it will be driven by EUV and the next generation.\nAnalysts: And as an unrelated follow-up, if I could get some clarity around China. You've given us an idea of shipment to domestic customers in 2018. In the past, you've talked about the cumulative LIFO opportunity, if I remember correctly, of around EUR 3 billion. Could you give us a sense on -- have -- is your sentiment more positive, more negative? And how are you thinking about China over the next 2 to 3 years?\nExecutives: Yes. I think we actually mentioned that EUR 3 billion mark, but that takes into account, I think, our view as to the speed, realistic speed with which our domestic Chinese customers will be able to ramp their fabs and to get their products qualified. Now if they can do this faster, then you would probably see an uptick on that EUR 3 billion. And if they would do it, let's say, at a speed with which we would normally see in memory and in logic, you could probably get to a number that's almost twice as high as the EUR 3 billion. But that is given the fact that many of these are greenfield -- not only greenfield fabs, but also greenfield companies, and that's why we take a more conservative view. But I would say, let's stick to the EUR 3 billion, and let's work very closely together with those customer to see whether they can accelerate.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mr. Jagadish Iyer.\nAnalysts: Yes, Summit Redstone. Two questions, Peter. If you look at the foundry logic, if you look at calendar '17, there's not been a significant uptick in your revenue in foundry logic segment. Whereas if you compare it to the memory, there's been a significant uptick there. So how should we think about growth in memory revenues in calendar '18? And is there a potential risk that these customers decide to scale back on capital spending if the pricing environment does not support such a situation? And I have a follow-up.\nExecutives: Yes. I think we've -- both for memory and logic, we see similar patterns in 2018 with -- there are some potential upside, which is customer-driven. I think that the second half of your question is probably more relevant one because it comes up time and time again. The way we look at this is, are we creating an overcapacity in terms of the bit supply into the memory market, both DRAM and the NAND. Now if we look at what our customers are currently asking us and the forecast that they give is for what they want in 2018 is, of course, not fully yet in the backlog. And if we take that and we take into account the nodes that they want to use this on, the effect it will have on the bit density, then we can calculate what the capacity addition will be in terms of bits. And in DRAM, where we will be probably anywhere -- let's say, mid-20s max, yes? So anywhere between 22% to 25%. And in NAND, the capacity addition of what we can see based on litho will be around mid-40s. And these are -- the way currently our customers are talking about and the analysts are talking about it, it's about the same as the demand bit growth looks like. So when we take those 2 together and we look at the capability of the lithography machines to add bits, it seems that it's pretty much in balance. So is there a risk? There's always a risk because it's about the end markets, it's about the global economy. But from where we are today, we don't see that as a major issue.\nAnalysts: Okay. And then I have a follow-up. So you talked about EUV, and you talked about 125 wafers an hour. On a high level, can you kind of quantify in calendar '17 in terms of your progress, in terms of productivity of it and availability? And what should be the milestone for calendar '18 -- not quarter-to-quarter variation, but just on an overall annual level milestones?\nExecutives: Yes. You have to realize that nobody has EUV in full production yet. I mean, it's all coming out of the development phase. So they're qualifying product, which actually means nobody runs 125 wafers per hour continuously. I mean, we're not there yet. We'll eventually start in the back half of 2018, but that capability is actually there. And there are some tests that are being done by customers and by us. They'll show us that capability. Now with respect to the availability with the 3400, we're over 80%. We seek significantly over 80%. And I think the target by the end of this year will be that the availability numbers are such that customers feel comfortable to put the tools into production that will give them around 1,500, maximum 2,000 wafers per day. And that is then a result of 125 wafers per hour on average, and availability and the -- let's say, in active hours that customers are planning for their own production. So that part of the 1,500 to 2,000 wafers per day, that is what we're focusing on, and that seems very feasible with everything we have on the table today, which I think is evidenced by the fact that customers are giving us orders. We got 10 orders in Q4.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mr. Dave Mulholland.\nAnalysts: It's David Mulholland from UBS. Firstly, one of the strengths in the quarter was clearly the memory bookings. And I wonder if you could just help us understand how that breaks down in the quarter for as much visibility as you have between DRAM and NAND and how that's changed versus Q3 and also how much of it's coming from China at this stage. And then I've got a follow-up.\nExecutives: Yes. To answer the last part, China, of course, we have greenfield fabs there. They don't go into ramp, like I said, in -- as an answer to an earlier question, aren't going to ramp up with the same speed as the mature memory companies. So they will take those tools and will use those tools to create a first line where they can qualify their product. So it will be -- it is in there in terms of the bookings. Now split between DRAM and NAND is very difficult for the simple reason that customers are continuously assessing how to allocate their lithography capabilities and their capacity between DRAM and between NAND, and there are a lot of relocations going on between DRAM and NAND. That's why some time ago, we decided to just give you the memory segment as one segment and don't split between DRAM and NAND because they are continuously changing because of those -- the reallocations.\nAnalysts: That's clear. And then just on the follow-up. One of the comments you made was, obviously, 2 tools being recognized earlier in Q4. I just wondered if you can give us some clarity on what drove that. Was it the customer lowering the performance requirement that got you there earlier? Or was it better performance on your side in terms of getting to the targets quicker?\nExecutives: It was because the customer signed off on the specification that we agreed when we shipped the tool. So no better or worse specification, just we met the specification in the sign-off.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mr. Jerome Ramel.\nAnalysts: Yes. Jerome Ramel, Exane BNP Paribas. One quick question on EUV. Can you update us on the mask inspection and pellicles?\nExecutives: Okay. Mask inspection, well, we shipped the first e-beam mask inspection tool through our HMI subsidiary. Mask, in itself, as we also showed in the presentation this morning, whether you have the excess -- but at least, we show we make significant progress on the pellicle development. So let's say pellicles are now able to be used at the 250-watt power level. Lifetime of pellicles is going up. We're all moving very nicely into the volume production area. And so masks and the mask infrastructure, we don't think there's any issue that will prevent our customers to put EUV into volume production in the course of the year.\nAnalysts: And another follow-up on the high NA EUV. Some of your potential client made a comment that they might need to build new fabs to go with the new tools. Is that the reason you are sharing? The question is, can we eventually use high NA EUV in existing fabs? Or do we have to redesign the fabs?\nExecutives: Well, I think it's similar to the current EUV tool. I mean, when we -- 5 years ago, the current EUV tool did not fit into many of the fabs at that moment in time. I mean, it's a better fab height. It's the strength of the floor. It's -- those are bigger tools. But this is -- as long as we -- and this is why we have such a coordinated and very detailed interaction with our customers on the high NA, is also to make sure that they understand the full specification sets, not only from a lithography point of view, but also from a logistics and a facility management point of view. That's been communicated, and I hope customers will build new fabs, not only because high NA, because the market is growing and we need more of those devices. And I think that was the main reason why we start building new fabs and then take into account that some of the tools are a bit bigger.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mr. Douglas Smith.\nAnalysts: Great quarter, by the way. I noticed that the dry EUV moved up from 20 units to 25 units, Q3 to Q4, but the immersion went from 22 to 20. Is that evidence of the increasing importance of NAND in your portfolio?\nExecutives: No. I think to draw conclusions on the quarter-to-quarter comparison between Q3 and Q4 is -- I think you probably shouldn't do that because it's -- it could be all kinds of incidental factors, customer-specific shipments. But generally, I would say that the dry Deep UV systems are going up in numbers going forward, because, yes, you are absolutely correct, there is a higher need in the 3D NAND space. Now it's not only because the 3D NAND space grows, but it's for different reasons. One, we use stacks-of-stacks, like I said in my prepared comments, which actually means you need extra litho steps to connect those stacks. That is one. But also there is -- there are specific requirements that we need to put there as dry tools, but because there are peculiarities, I could say, with the 3D NAND manufacturing, which have to do with what wafers, which have to do with opaque layers so that the alignment needs to be different. And all those specific peculiarities of 3D NAND will be addressed by us by bringing out the tools and options on the tools that will enable our customers to increase their yields and to make sure that they can do effective 3D NAND production.\nAnalysts: Got it. On a kind of related issue, I was wondering, are you seeing any evidence yet that with the traction of EUV, customers might be planning on ordering fewer immersion systems, which I guess is kind the whole point of introducing EUV in the longer term?\nExecutives: Yes. I think -- what I think, it's probably best is we look at our Analyst Day of 2016. We gave you a couple of scenarios where high EUV introduction, lower EUV introduction for several reasons. It could be EUV not as effective as we then, at that moment in time, planned or whether markets were different. And you can actually conclude from those scenarios that higher EUV will lead to somewhat lower immersion, but still significant. And it's logical because it will cannibalize some of the multiple patterning layers. On the other hand also, layers are growing, yes? So it also -- so basically, there is a dilutive effect in that sense that you have more layers, and some of those layers will be deep UV layers, will be the immersion layers. So no matter how you look at it, the number of EUV and of immersion systems will still remain significant, also with high EUV introduction. So -- this is I'd like to refer back to that -- to those 4 scenarios that we showed in the end of 2016.\nExecutives: And just to give you the numbers, I mean, these 4 scenarios had anything between 50 and 80 tools. And that -- right in the middle of that range, around 70, is what we're shipping right now. It's not -- in no case it is going down significantly.\nAnalysts: Right. So it's that you're saying it's too early, really, to judge the level of cannibalization of EUV to immersion?\nExecutives: Yes. There will be probably some. I mean, if we now look at a quite -- at a good EUV adoption, which is -- I think is a realistic assumption right now, then yes, there will be some effect on immersion tools. But it's not going to be significant.\nExecutives: I think, by the way, that if you look at over the lifetime, over a very long period, it's actually not cannibalizing immersion at all because EUV, at one point in -- without EUV at one point in time, there wouldn't be even new nodes. And if there's a new node, there will also always be layers for immersion. So if you don't get it at a very long period of time, it's actually not cannibalizing at all. It's actually keeping it alive.\nAnalysts: Yes, that's a good point.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini.\nAnalysts: Yes. Mehdi Hosseini from Susquehanna International. A couple of follow-up. Peter, how should I think about your DRAM customers that are planning for EUV? Would that take for you to hit that 2,000-wafer-per-day target before you see a step-up in booking activity? Or is there any other metric that I need to track? And any insight here would be great. And I have a couple of follow-ups.\nExecutives: Yes. I think it's not a surprise that DRAM devices are more cost sensitive than advanced logic. So it is true that the 2,000 wafers per day is -- we've said it before, is a realistic economic productivity target. I think if we meet that target or, let's say, on a continuous basis, it's our assessment that, that will be a very attractive economic entry point for DRAM. Now -- and how realistic is 2,000 wafers per day? With everything that we have on the road map today, I think it is realistic to be there by the end of the year. So now, that -- let's work very hard and execute on it and work very closely together with our customers to get to that point because that, of course, it will be only for a very few layers, but there's a lot of DRAM wafers. So that could give an extra impetus to our EUV story.\nAnalysts: Sure. Now I wanted to reconcile this with large-source capacity. How long will it take for ZEISS to add additional capacity? Do you have any flexibility to accelerate investment there or accelerate capacity, manufacturing capacity so that your 30-plus target for 2019 could increase? And I'm asking you this because if you're able to increase confidence among your DRAM customers that you can actually do 2,000 wafer per day, wouldn't they need to place a PO before '19? And wouldn't some of these EUV shipment would have to take place into DRAM customer by late '19? So doesn't that create a kind of a double-edged sword? And I want to get your view on the kind of levers that you can pull to accommodate these DRAM customers.\nExecutives: Yes. It's -- you're making -- you're asking very elaborate question, and I'll give you a very simple answer. The way that we -- the lead time to increase capacity at ZEISS has lapsed. I mean, we are where we are today. The only way to get 30-plus and how much the plus is, is dependent on the cycle time reduction in the factory of ZEISS. The faster they can do that and the better they can do that, the more we can squeeze out. Because everything else are long lead time items in terms of capacities, buildings, machines, people, training, the whole thing. That will not happen until 2020 and our output in 2020, which is their output in 2019. So that means we have what we have, yes? And that also means we are very transparent to our customers on the 2019 potential shipment plan and when those machines will come available. We're very transparent to every customer, and it's up to them to decide whether they want to take up that capacity. And there's very little we can do other than just working very hard with our ZEISS colleagues to keep reducing the cycle time to squeeze out a few extras. But that's what it is, and it's up to the customers to react on the transparency that we will give them.\nExecutives: And probably 2 clarifications, just in case I got your questions wrong. So you referred to the light source. Of course, the light source is not done at ZEISS. It's the optical system. And secondly, you seem to imply that DRAM EUV shipments would start late in 2019. We are already shipping EUV systems now. So I mean, it will also be in DRAM in high-volume manufacturing in 2019. Just so that's clear.\nAnalysts: Does the elaborate question give me a quick follow-up?\nExecutives: Yes, because [indiscernible] -- and we know it's your [indiscernible] -- for your [indiscernible] of time [indiscernible].\nAnalysts: Okay, great. You made an interesting point about the e-beam mask inspection. You said that you have already shipped your first tool. How should we think about a year or 2 from now? Should we assume that you actually can turn this into a volume production and actually help customers meet the inspection or mask inspection without relying on other vendors?\nExecutives: Well, yes. It's a fully equipped mask inspection tool. So it's an e-beam tool, it can be used for e-beam mask inspection. And the more EUVs is used in terms of layers, the more mask inspection tools are needed. So I think we just are going to deliver and ship in that market, and yes, it's what it is. And I think when we did the HMI acquisition last year, I think we also put a date, the year before in 2016. I think we did discuss the opportunity of e-beam mask inspection as a couple of hundred million euros of -- this is -- it is where it is, and I think the success of EUV will, of course, help us also penetrate that market.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ms. Tammy Qiu.\nAnalysts: Tammy Qiu from Berenberg. So the first question is on the cycle. I understand that based on your comment, 2018 is likely to be a nice year. I'm just wondering, what's your view on 2019 and what going to be the end market driver there?\nExecutives: Well, I've just sold my crystal ball, so I can't -- I really can't answer this, but it all depends on the end markets. I mean, the -- at least on the -- but just a more high-level answer is the proliferation and the penetration of IC devices into almost everything now is -- it actually makes it more volatile, I think, macroeconomics swings. So you want to talk about cycles, I think there will be macroeconomic cycles. I said it in the press conference this morning also, and -- but when that happens, I don't know, yes? The only thing is when it happens, we will be able to react up or down. And in your case, you seem to communicate what's the possibility of a downward question, I don't know. But when it happens, we have all the means and the flexibility to react.\nAnalysts: Okay. And the second question is, you talked about the EUV won't actually limit the demand for Deep UV. So in general, I would say, does that mean equipment have to become more and more expensive for the chip makers over time, so therefore they will have to keep buying the more expensive and more equipment for making a leading edge node? So I'm not sure how you view this point. Do you, as an equipment maker, need to cut the price at certain point so that they don't have to pay crazy CapEx all the time? Or can they actually pass on the incremental CapEx to their customers?\nExecutives: Well, what you're basically asking is, is Moore's Law still viable, yes? Because when I just -- well, just before the press conference, I bumped into one of the really senior ASML lab leads, and he said, \"You know, this is great where the company is going. I still remember sending out the first invoice for $1 million. Now we're selling a EUR 120 million tool.\" So to your point, yes, customers have started to pay a lot more for those tools. But of course, the transition and the cost per function has continuously gone down on a logarithmic scale, yes? So is Moore's Law viable? Yes, we believe it's still viable, and yes, our customers will pay higher price for our machines whereby the cost per function will keep going down.\nOperator: The next question will come from Mr. Andrew Gardiner.\nAnalysts: It's Andrew Gardiner from Barclays. We spent quite a bit of time talking about memory this afternoon. I was just wondering if we could spend a minute or 2 on logic and just in terms of the -- first on the near-term thinking through 2018 and the sort of strength or sort of node migration plans in place there. How do you view your sort of visibility into that logic business this year? I presume it's better or sort of firmer than we see in memory, where you seem to be highlighting the potential risk in the back half or, at least, lack of visibility in the back half. But how -- so where's your conviction level or -- to where a customer sort of order rates in terms of the 10 and 7 nanometer migrations?\nExecutives: Yes. I think what we've -- we haven't changed our view as compared to 1 or 2 quarters ago. I mean, the logic 10-nanometer ramp is still going, actually, to the areas in China, where we're shipping 14 and 28. And more importantly, I think what we will see is by the back half of the year, we'll start to see EUV going into 7-nanometer pilot production. This ramp, I think -- and also, if you look at the comments made by our customers and their assessment of the size of the nodes, there is no reason whatsoever to believe that they -- that there is an indication that those nodes will actually dwindle in terms of number of wafers that they would need to build that capacity. And on the contrary, I think comments are being made by customers on the 7 and 10-nanometer nodes as being very large nodes, and they're seeing a lot of [ date bounce ]. So there is no indication whatsoever to change our view. And like I said earlier and we look at the memory and the logic business, we see 2018 developing at least at the same level as 2017 for both logic and memory with some upside here and there.\nAnalysts: Okay. If I could just have a quick sort of accounting follow-up for Wolfgang. We're starting to see the sort of the ZEISS investment come through in terms of the equity income line. It was somewhat negative in the fourth quarter. Is there a rough rule of thumb we should be thinking of as we put that in our models for future periods?\nExecutives: Yes. The -- first of all for everybody, we had 2 agreements with ZEISS: one was a high NA investment agreement and one was an equity agreement. The high NA one, obviously, goes through our R&D line and also through our balance sheet as it relates to the CapEx. But as it relates to the equity investment, you will see that equity method investment on the balance sheet of about EUR 1 billion for the 24.9% that we own, and then you see 2 elements in our financial statements. First of all, you see in the P&L a profit that's attributed to those 24.9%, and therefore, the first quarter, you saw a negative EUR 17 million. And the second thing that you see is in our cash flow from investing. You see the dividend attributed to that investment, and you see that we received a dividend also for 3 months period of almost EUR 20 million. So the dividend is basically, since SMT basically distributes their earnings, a very good reflection of the profitability of that business. Now accounting makes this a little bit complicated because you need to do numerous things, but you start from a very healthy profit. And then you start off with, number one, the adjustment from IFRS to U.S. GAAP. Number two, you adjust for differences in accounting policies between the companies. But then number three is where it really hits you. Even though it's not an acquisition, you still need to do purchase price accounting. That means you need to write up the inventory to the fair market value. You need to identify intangibles. And then you do the same thing that what you have heard us talking about when we talked about HMI, you need to consume that inventory and you need to amortize these intangibles. And that takes your profit all the way to a EUR 17 million loss. Now as it relates to the future, this is something that will still be with us for a long time because these intangible has a lifetime of 15 years plus. But the inventory part, we will walk through within a year or so. So I think, net-net for 2018, this will still be a loss. And then in 2019, you will also see a profit on that line and then depreciate. And then the cash, of course, follows the true profit and cash flow of SMT. And from a cash flow perspective, you should see a much, much higher number every year.\nAnalysts: It wasn't such a good follow-up, sorry.\nExecutives: Yes, good one to end though. Ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one last question. If you were unable to get through on this call and still have questions, please feel free to contact the ASML Investor Relations department with your question. Now operator, may we have the last caller please?\nOperator: The final question will come from Mr. Robert Sanders.\nAnalysts: It's Deutsche Bank. I just had a last question on the EUV backlog. Just in terms of how many of those 28 tools are with the planned 251 configuration as opposed to -- I think it's 205 of the standard tool? And I have a follow-up.\nExecutives: All of them, because there will be -- even if it's -- we have the commitment to have all those tool ultimately to be at 251. But -- so in fact, they're all at the 251 configuration.\nAnalysts: I got it. So all of them will have an extra amount of money to be billed to the customer once you get up to 251 because that's beyond the spec, right?\nExecutives: No, because the spec is we need to do 251 to get the 125 wafers. So when we get over 251, we get more wafers out there, we get extra money. But 125 wafers is what we sold to them.\nAnalysts: Okay. And just last question for Wolfgang, just on the gross margin in 2018. Given what you said about being higher than, I think, 45%, is 45% to 46% a kind of good model number for our models for 2018? You can just give us a vague range, that'd be great.\nExecutives: I think we would have [ knocked ] the result if it's only extremely marginal, but I don't want to tie it down to a specific number at this point either. So we'll go through the year. And the more important thing is it will be a good step forward towards the 50 plus in 2020. That's really what we're working for.\nExecutives: Now on behalf of ASML's board and management, I would like to thank you all for joining us today. \nOperator, if you could formally conclude the call, I'd appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the ASML 2017 Fourth Quarter and Annual Financial Results Conference Call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the ASML 2017 Fourth Quarter and Annual Financial Results Conference Call on January 17, 2018. [Operator Instructions] \nI would now like to open the question-and-answer queue. [Operator Instructions] \nI would now like to turn the conference call over to Mr. Skip Miller. Go ahead, please, sir.\nExecutives: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, good morning, ladies and gentlemen. This is Skip Miller, Vice President of Investor Relations at ASML. Joining me today from ASML headquarters in Veldhoven in Netherlands is ASML CEO, Peter Wennink; and CFO, Wolfgang Nickl. \nThe subject of today's call is ASML's 2017 fourth quarter and annual results. The length of this call will be 60 minutes, and questions will be taken in the order that they are received. This call is also being broadcast live over the Internet at asml.com. A transcript of management's opening remarks and a replay of the call will be available on our website shortly following the conclusion of this call.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to caution listeners that comments made by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements involve material risks and uncertainties. For a discussion of risk factors, I encourage you to review the safe harbor statement contained in today's press release and presentation found on our website at asml.com and in ASML's annual report on Form 20-F and other documents as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to Peter Wennink for a brief introduction.\nExecutives: Thank you, Skip. Good morning and good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining us for our Fourth Quarter and 2017 Annual Results Conference Call. \nBefore we begin the question-and-answer session, Wolfgang and I would like to provide you with an overview and some commentary on the fourth quarter and the full year 2017 as well as provide our view of the coming quarters. Wolfgang will start with a review of our fourth quarter financial performance with the -- some added comments on our short-term outlook, and I will complete the introduction with some additional comments on the current business environment and our future business outlook. \nThank you.\nExecutives: Thank you, Peter, and welcome, everyone. I will first highlight some of the fourth quarter and full year financial accomplishments and then provide our guidance for the first quarter of 2018. \nQ4 net sales came in at EUR 2.56 billion, exceeding our guidance by over EUR 400 million. Due to demand strength, some customers requested earlier shipments of lithography systems, which we were able to accommodate late in the quarter. This accounted for almost half of the EUR 400 million, and the other half came from earlier-than-expected acceptance of the performance of 2 previously shipped EUV systems by a customer, which led to recognition of deferred revenue in Q4. Net system sales of EUR 1.95 billion was strengthened by memory, which contributed 53% of sales, foundry accounted for 29% and IDM was 18% of system sales. Installed Base Management sales for the quarter came in at EUR 606 million, which was in line with our guidance. \nGross margin for the quarter came in at 45.2%, which was 120 basis points higher than our guidance. This was the result of much stronger-than-expected DUV sales, more than offsetting the dilutive effect from incremental EUV revenue that was recognized during the quarter. Overall OpEx came in slightly above guidance, with R&D expenses at EUR 317 million and SG&A expenses at EUR 113 million. \nTurning to the balance sheet. Quarter-over-quarter cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments came in at EUR 3.29 billion. During the quarter, we purchased approximately EUR 331 million worth of shares. Since January 2016, we have purchased a total of approximately 8.2 million shares with a value of EUR 900 million against our 2016 and '17 authorization of EUR 1.5 billion.\nMoving on to the order book. Q4 systems bookings came in at a strong EUR 2.93 billion. This is almost an EUR 800 million increase compared to Q3 bookings. The order intake was driven by the memory sector, representing 55% of orders, compared to 30% for foundry and 15% for IDM. We took 10 new orders for EUV systems, and our EUV backlog now reflects 28 systems valued at EUR 3.1 billion. Our overall system backlog now totals a record EUR 6.68 billion and is balanced nicely between memory, foundry and IDM.\nOur strong Q4 results marked the closure of an exceptional year for the industry and ASML. For the full year, our net sales grew 33% to a record of EUR 9.05 billion. Net Installed Base Management sales grew more than 25% to a record of EUR 2.68 billion. With total EUV sales almost at EUR 1.2 billion, 2017 was the year when preparations for inserting EUV into high-volume chip manufacturing shifted into a higher gear. Of the 12 EUV shipments planned for 2017, we shipped 10 during the year. One shipment is in progress, and one shipment is planned this month. This means that our 2018 shipment plan will increase by 2 to a total of 22 systems.\nWe made considerable improvements on our EUV gross margin in 2017, achieving 0% in the fourth quarter. Due to accelerated investments in EUV service infrastructure, we had not achieved 0% for the full year. Nevertheless, even with a more than 3x increase in EUV revenue from 2016 to 2017, we were able to improve our corporate gross margin to 45%. We are on track to achieving overall gross margins exceeding 50% in 2020.\nWe continue to invest in the long-term future of ASML, and increased R&D from EUR 1.1 billion in 2016 to EUR 1.26 billion in 2017. This increase was driven by accounting for a full year of HMI, our contributions to Zeiss SMT and our own investments in high NA. Overall R&D investments as a percentage of revenue decreased from about 16% in 2016 to about 14% in 2017. \nSG&A as a percentage of revenue reduced by almost 1 percentage point to about 4.6% of revenue. Our net income for the full year grew 44% to a record of EUR 2.12 billion, resulting in a net margin of 23.4% and an EPS of EUR 4.93.\nWith that, I would like to turn to our expectations and guidance for the first quarter of 2018. We expect Q1 total net sales of around EUR 2.2 billion. As a reminder, we pulled approximately EUR 400 million from this quarter into Q4 2017. While we target to ship 4 EUV systems in the March quarter, we expect revenue recognition of about EUR 150 million for all EUV business. Overall, we do expect quarter-over-quarter revenue growth throughout 2018. We expect our Q1 Installed Base Management revenue to come in around EUR 600 million. \nGross margin for Q1 is expected to be between 47% and 48%. R&D expenses for Q1 will reflect continued accelerated investments in our portfolio and will come in at around EUR 350 million. SG&A is expected to come in at about EUR 115 million. We are excited about 2018, which will be a year of continued strong growth in revenue and profitability. \nToday, we also announced a new share buyback program for 2018 and '19 of up to EUR 2.5 billion. We intend to cancel these shares after repurchase with the exception of up to 2.4 million shares, which will be used to cover employee share plans. Additionally, we also will propose a 17% increase in our dividend to EUR 1.40 per share at our Annual Shareholder Meeting, which takes place on April 25 in Veldhoven. The dividend payment is valued at around EUR 600 million.\nWith that, I would like to turn the call back over to you, Peter.\nExecutives: Thank you, Wolfgang. As Wolfgang highlighted, that we had another record year in 2017. The demand for our full product portfolio was very strong, and our business continues to perform very well. The strong demand in both logic and memory set new revenue records across both sectors in 2017. Expanding end market applications, IC device content growth, increasing litho intensity, all evidenced by our strong backlog, provide a good basis for this positive momentum to continue in 2018.\nMost others, but certainly due to high demand from the server market, DRAM system demand remained strong as our customers continue to migrate to sub-20 nanometer nodes. Advanced nodes are more litho-intensive and, thus, drive increased litho demand. In 3D NAND, litho demand is also strong, as a number of customers continue to ramp through greenfield fabs and scale vertically with so-called stack-of-stacks. Additional lithography is required to connect these stacks, which further drives up litho intensity. But adding the NAND opportunity to the DRAM business outlook for next year, we see another strong memory year ahead.\nLogic demand continues to be solid as customers ramp 10-nanometer and starts transition to the 7-nanometer node. Litho intensity continues to increase with migration to more advanced nodes with further growth with the adoption of EUV at 7-nanometers. EUV production ramp will accelerate in 2018 as customers are eager to realize the benefits of process simplification, cycle time reduction, yield improvement and ultimately resulting in cost benefits.\nIn regards to China, we set a new record for this region in 2017 with over EUR 700 million in revenue. In addition to strong demand from existing customers in the region, we're also planning to ship to 5 domestic Chinese customers in 2018 for both memory and logic applications. With continued ramp of fabs in China, both from domestic and nondomestic customers, we see a very clear growth opportunity in this region over the coming years.\nOn the ASML product side, let me start with an update on our EUV business. In EUV, we continued to make significant progress in 2017. We demonstrated all system specifications, including 125 wafers per hour, while continuing to improve availability. Customer demand is strong, evidenced by public statements of their plans to introduce this technology, with volume production starting in 2018. We booked 10 EUV orders in Q4, bringing our backlog to 28 systems in which we plan to shipment 22 in 2018. Shipment profile, however, will be back half-loaded as our planned step-up in move rate will effectively only have an impact in the second half of 2018. Our EUV shipment plan beyond 2018 is unchanged with 30-plus in 2019 and 40-plus in 2020.\nIn Deep UV, we shipped a total of 161 new systems in 2017, which is a 21% increase from 2016. We were able to significantly boost output in support of our increased customer demand in both memory and logic. We also provided customers with an early access version of TWINSCAN NXT:2000, which is our most advanced immersion lithography system. It's used for process development of the NXT node devices. As a sign of the continuously increasing maturity of the NXT platform, the NXT:2000 system already meets or exceeds all of its performance targets. With 3D NAND customers, we expanded our options portfolio. We addressed critical process challenges and delivery of improved performance. \nIn Holistic Lithography, we showed growth across the full portfolio of software and metrology products. We shipped our first jointly developed product less than 1 year after closing of the HMI acquisition. This product, ePfm5, the pattern fidelity metrology system that leverages HMI's high-resolution e-beam metrology with ASML's computational lithography technology. This product's high-resolution capability enables high capture rate of systematic patterning defects so customers can accelerate their yield learning curves and drive higher production yields. Both of these, we shipped our first EUV e-beam mask inspection system.\nAs to 2018, we expect continued solid growth in both sales and profitability. Our high-level view of 2018 business is largely unchanged relative to comments that we made last quarter. While we were able to recognize an additional EUR 400 million of revenue in 2017, which could be seen as a pull-in from 2018, it will not impact our view of 2018 as it will be wholly compensated by increased Deep UV demand.\nIn summary, we had another record year in 2017 with 33% revenue growth and 44% net income growth over 2016, strong demand in both logic and memory set new revenue records in 2017, and we expect both sectors to see continued growth in 2018, supported by increased EUV sales. Expanding end market applications, device IC content growth, increasing litho intensity, as evidenced by our record backlog, provide a strong indication that this positive momentum will continue in 2018. \nWith that, we will be happy to take your questions.\nExecutives: Thank you, Peter. [Operator Instructions]\nNow operator, do we have your final instruction and 10 first questions, please?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Mr. Farhan Ahmad.\nAnalysts: This is Farhan Ahmad from Credit Suisse. My question is on EUV. You booked them, the system orders. Can you talk about the mix of customers within that? Is it coming from memory or foundry? And are there many multiple customers within that?\nExecutives: Yes. There are multiple customers. It is dominated by the logic side of our business, and that is also -- when we look at next year, next year, we see sales increase in logic really driven by EUV, and the memory sales increase is driven by Deep UV.\nAnalysts: Got it. And then in terms of the linearity for the year, is there much change between memory and logic lengths in the year as first half, more memory demand, and second, more foundry logic as some of the other companies have said?\nExecutives: Not on the Deep UV side and on EUV side. And on the EUV side, as mentioned in the prepared remarks, it will be a more back end-loaded.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mr. C.J. Muse.\nAnalysts: C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI. First question, I guess -- was hoping that you could discuss, Peter, what you're seeing in the supply chain on the EUV side. Would love to get an update in terms of optics and things like that and whether you're feeling better, same, worse in terms of hitting that 30 tool target into the 2019 time frame?\nExecutives: Yes. I think with respect to my feeling, no changes. I think it's the same as we said last quarter. It has to do with the fact that the step-ups in capacity are really long lead time items. So this is not something that you change one quarter to the other. So the supply chain situation is what it is. And I think the 30-plus is limited, as we said before, by the supply chain, and the 40-plus is really when this supply chain can kick into the next steps. So no real change.\nAnalysts: Okay. And I guess as my follow-up, you guided gross margin higher year-over-year despite the nice tick higher in EUV shipments. So curious, if you think about non-EUV and growth in inspection and an uptick on the DUV side, is it fair to say that, overall, that part of your business can do roughly 53%, 54% gross margin through the year?\nExecutives: I wouldn't like to nail it down to an exact percentage. But if you look at both other businesses, so the Holistic Lithography business and the Deep UV business, you will see an increased mix towards the more powerful machines, and that has a positive effect on gross margins. Also, we continue to do a lot of very profitable upgrades. And then from a mix between Deep UV and Holistic Lithography, you will see also, the next 2 or 3 years, a continued mix towards Holistic Lithography, which will have a slightly higher mix in our overall revenue. And since this is a very software-driven, it structurally also contributes to the non-EUV business being up, so both effects. Both of these businesses go up based on the products that we offer, and then you also have a mix base effect. And that, of course, comes together with us making significant progress on the EUV. And that's why we feel confident that from the 45%, we can advance in 2018 and then get to our 50%-plus in 2020.\nExecutives: C.J., if I just may add one general comment on this is, going forward, I mean, we are guiding -- and as we did, we are guiding a corporate gross margin, and going forward, we will do that. Because if you look at what our customers really want from us is node-to-node transitions, and node-to-node transitions, going forward, are really a combination of the entire set of products and services that we are offering. So you will see agreements with our customers that involve EUV, Deep UV, Holistic and applications in one go, and we will make one PPA, which expects -- which effectively gives us one gross margin. So going forward, we will guide you more and more on the overall corporate gross margin because it doesn't make sense to give you -- and I don't want to do that either, to give you any specific gross margin guidance for those products because we have the PPAs for the entire product portfolio of ASML.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mr. Sandeep Deshpande.\nAnalysts: Sandeep Deshpande, JPMorgan. My first question is on EUV. Could you possibly help us understand in terms of the recognition on EUV into 2018, are you going to be recognizing that in all the tools on shipments by the second half of this year as well as the past deferred revenue on EUV will be fully recognized in 2018? And I have a quick follow-up on EUV as well.\nExecutives: Okay. Let me see whether I can structure this for you because there's a lot of moving parts here. The first comment is by the end of the year, we should be able to recognize the majority of the revenue of a system as we ship it. At the beginning of the year, we still have shipments, as you have heard from my prepared remarks. Q1, for instance, we're planning to ship 4 systems, recognizing only EUR 150 million. There are still shipments that have -- of tools that have changes in them that require us to wait with revenue recognition for an acceptance of the tool at the customer side. So these Q1 shipments will, however, recognize in the second half of the year. On top of that, we are carrying a deferred revenue balance of around EUR 500 million on our balance sheet from prior shipments, and they're both short term and long term. So some of them will come into the P&L in 2018, and some will even carry a little bit into 2019. If you put it altogether, we expect the revenue for the EUV business to be somewhere in the EUR 2.3 billion range for the year. As a reminder, just so for clarification, we said EUR 2.5 billion in the last call. But of course, we achieved the acceptance of 2 tools already in 2017, and of course, they moved into 2017, where we overachieved by EUR 200 million. I hope that helps, Sandeep.\nAnalysts: Good. And then following up to your earlier response, Peter, regarding EUV for 2019. I mean, some of those very strong orders you talked in the fourth quarter are clearly 2019-related. How do you see -- I mean, the order [ bearing ] for 2019, do you expect that because of your lead time, you'll get almost all the 2019-related EUV orders in this year itself? Or this is going to continue right through next year in terms of getting orders? And then -- had -- will you also start seeing a 2020 level of indication from customers for EUV?\nExecutives: Yes. I think what we're working on, and because it's also on customer request, is clearly a reduction of the cycle time of our EUV tools. I mean, it has to come down by 2020. We really like to be at the cycle time anywhere between 12 and 15 months. That means also customers will take account of that, and that means that they will actually postpone issuing the orders to reflect that reduced cycle time. Now the first cycle time reductions, we will probably see somewhere at the -- towards the end of 2018. But I would suspect that the majority, I think the significant majority of everything that we will ship in 2019 will be booked in 2018, because these cycle time reductions will really take effect later, and that will then have an effect on the order lead time of our customers. So vast majority should be in this year.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mr. Amit Harchandani.\nAnalysts: Amit Harchandani from Citigroup. My first question would be with regards to the current traction you're seeing on the high NA EUV side. If you could please update us on the same, and I say so in the context of your 2020 ambition, but clearly the market is looking for some color or trajectory in terms of how revenues are likely to shape up beyond 2020, and high NA is a critical ingredient of the same. So would be great to know your thoughts on the same, and then I have a follow-up.\nExecutives: Yes. That's a good question. I think we have had extensive discussion with our customers on our high NA concept, and I mean, the -- how the machine looks like and the performance specifications that we started and already way into 2017. I think we got confirmation from all our major customers that high NA makes complete sense from a technical point of view, from an economical point of view. So they want us to execute on this. Now currently, we are in discussion with our customers under what terms and conditions we should start shipping the first R&D tools and how quickly after the R&D tools we should start ramping up for volume. Now having said that, we do realize that a high NA tool is really a new scanner. It's not so much a new EUV source. As you know, the EUV source being the main reason why there was a delay with the EUV introduction. We were using the same source as for the current EUV generation. So that means that we would be able to actually see a high-volume high NA EUV tools shipping somewhere in the middle of the next decade, starting to be used in the high-volume production and then ramping in the second half of the next decade. Now those will be tools that we're currently looking at pricing significantly over EUR 200 million. And that means that if you then look beyond the 2020 target number in terms of sales end, you don't need a lot of imagination to foresee our top line growing significantly beyond 2020, and it will be driven by EUV and the next generation.\nAnalysts: And as an unrelated follow-up, if I could get some clarity around China. You've given us an idea of shipment to domestic customers in 2018. In the past, you've talked about the cumulative LIFO opportunity, if I remember correctly, of around EUR 3 billion. Could you give us a sense on -- have -- is your sentiment more positive, more negative? And how are you thinking about China over the next 2 to 3 years?\nExecutives: Yes. I think we actually mentioned that EUR 3 billion mark, but that takes into account, I think, our view as to the speed, realistic speed with which our domestic Chinese customers will be able to ramp their fabs and to get their products qualified. Now if they can do this faster, then you would probably see an uptick on that EUR 3 billion. And if they would do it, let's say, at a speed with which we would normally see in memory and in logic, you could probably get to a number that's almost twice as high as the EUR 3 billion. But that is given the fact that many of these are greenfield -- not only greenfield fabs, but also greenfield companies, and that's why we take a more conservative view. But I would say, let's stick to the EUR 3 billion, and let's work very closely together with those customer to see whether they can accelerate.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mr. Jagadish Iyer.\nAnalysts: Yes, Summit Redstone. Two questions, Peter. If you look at the foundry logic, if you look at calendar '17, there's not been a significant uptick in your revenue in foundry logic segment. Whereas if you compare it to the memory, there's been a significant uptick there. So how should we think about growth in memory revenues in calendar '18? And is there a potential risk that these customers decide to scale back on capital spending if the pricing environment does not support such a situation? And I have a follow-up.\nExecutives: Yes. I think we've -- both for memory and logic, we see similar patterns in 2018 with -- there are some potential upside, which is customer-driven. I think that the second half of your question is probably more relevant one because it comes up time and time again. The way we look at this is, are we creating an overcapacity in terms of the bit supply into the memory market, both DRAM and the NAND. Now if we look at what our customers are currently asking us and the forecast that they give is for what they want in 2018 is, of course, not fully yet in the backlog. And if we take that and we take into account the nodes that they want to use this on, the effect it will have on the bit density, then we can calculate what the capacity addition will be in terms of bits. And in DRAM, where we will be probably anywhere -- let's say, mid-20s max, yes? So anywhere between 22% to 25%. And in NAND, the capacity addition of what we can see based on litho will be around mid-40s. And these are -- the way currently our customers are talking about and the analysts are talking about it, it's about the same as the demand bit growth looks like. So when we take those 2 together and we look at the capability of the lithography machines to add bits, it seems that it's pretty much in balance. So is there a risk? There's always a risk because it's about the end markets, it's about the global economy. But from where we are today, we don't see that as a major issue.\nAnalysts: Okay. And then I have a follow-up. So you talked about EUV, and you talked about 125 wafers an hour. On a high level, can you kind of quantify in calendar '17 in terms of your progress, in terms of productivity of it and availability? And what should be the milestone for calendar '18 -- not quarter-to-quarter variation, but just on an overall annual level milestones?\nExecutives: Yes. You have to realize that nobody has EUV in full production yet. I mean, it's all coming out of the development phase. So they're qualifying product, which actually means nobody runs 125 wafers per hour continuously. I mean, we're not there yet. We'll eventually start in the back half of 2018, but that capability is actually there. And there are some tests that are being done by customers and by us. They'll show us that capability. Now with respect to the availability with the 3400, we're over 80%. We seek significantly over 80%. And I think the target by the end of this year will be that the availability numbers are such that customers feel comfortable to put the tools into production that will give them around 1,500, maximum 2,000 wafers per day. And that is then a result of 125 wafers per hour on average, and availability and the -- let's say, in active hours that customers are planning for their own production. So that part of the 1,500 to 2,000 wafers per day, that is what we're focusing on, and that seems very feasible with everything we have on the table today, which I think is evidenced by the fact that customers are giving us orders. We got 10 orders in Q4.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mr. Dave Mulholland.\nAnalysts: It's David Mulholland from UBS. Firstly, one of the strengths in the quarter was clearly the memory bookings. And I wonder if you could just help us understand how that breaks down in the quarter for as much visibility as you have between DRAM and NAND and how that's changed versus Q3 and also how much of it's coming from China at this stage. And then I've got a follow-up.\nExecutives: Yes. To answer the last part, China, of course, we have greenfield fabs there. They don't go into ramp, like I said, in -- as an answer to an earlier question, aren't going to ramp up with the same speed as the mature memory companies. So they will take those tools and will use those tools to create a first line where they can qualify their product. So it will be -- it is in there in terms of the bookings. Now split between DRAM and NAND is very difficult for the simple reason that customers are continuously assessing how to allocate their lithography capabilities and their capacity between DRAM and between NAND, and there are a lot of relocations going on between DRAM and NAND. That's why some time ago, we decided to just give you the memory segment as one segment and don't split between DRAM and NAND because they are continuously changing because of those -- the reallocations.\nAnalysts: That's clear. And then just on the follow-up. One of the comments you made was, obviously, 2 tools being recognized earlier in Q4. I just wondered if you can give us some clarity on what drove that. Was it the customer lowering the performance requirement that got you there earlier? Or was it better performance on your side in terms of getting to the targets quicker?\nExecutives: It was because the customer signed off on the specification that we agreed when we shipped the tool. So no better or worse specification, just we met the specification in the sign-off.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mr. Jerome Ramel.\nAnalysts: Yes. Jerome Ramel, Exane BNP Paribas. One quick question on EUV. Can you update us on the mask inspection and pellicles?\nExecutives: Okay. Mask inspection, well, we shipped the first e-beam mask inspection tool through our HMI subsidiary. Mask, in itself, as we also showed in the presentation this morning, whether you have the excess -- but at least, we show we make significant progress on the pellicle development. So let's say pellicles are now able to be used at the 250-watt power level. Lifetime of pellicles is going up. We're all moving very nicely into the volume production area. And so masks and the mask infrastructure, we don't think there's any issue that will prevent our customers to put EUV into volume production in the course of the year.\nAnalysts: And another follow-up on the high NA EUV. Some of your potential client made a comment that they might need to build new fabs to go with the new tools. Is that the reason you are sharing? The question is, can we eventually use high NA EUV in existing fabs? Or do we have to redesign the fabs?\nExecutives: Well, I think it's similar to the current EUV tool. I mean, when we -- 5 years ago, the current EUV tool did not fit into many of the fabs at that moment in time. I mean, it's a better fab height. It's the strength of the floor. It's -- those are bigger tools. But this is -- as long as we -- and this is why we have such a coordinated and very detailed interaction with our customers on the high NA, is also to make sure that they understand the full specification sets, not only from a lithography point of view, but also from a logistics and a facility management point of view. That's been communicated, and I hope customers will build new fabs, not only because high NA, because the market is growing and we need more of those devices. And I think that was the main reason why we start building new fabs and then take into account that some of the tools are a bit bigger.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mr. Douglas Smith.\nAnalysts: Great quarter, by the way. I noticed that the dry EUV moved up from 20 units to 25 units, Q3 to Q4, but the immersion went from 22 to 20. Is that evidence of the increasing importance of NAND in your portfolio?\nExecutives: No. I think to draw conclusions on the quarter-to-quarter comparison between Q3 and Q4 is -- I think you probably shouldn't do that because it's -- it could be all kinds of incidental factors, customer-specific shipments. But generally, I would say that the dry Deep UV systems are going up in numbers going forward, because, yes, you are absolutely correct, there is a higher need in the 3D NAND space. Now it's not only because the 3D NAND space grows, but it's for different reasons. One, we use stacks-of-stacks, like I said in my prepared comments, which actually means you need extra litho steps to connect those stacks. That is one. But also there is -- there are specific requirements that we need to put there as dry tools, but because there are peculiarities, I could say, with the 3D NAND manufacturing, which have to do with what wafers, which have to do with opaque layers so that the alignment needs to be different. And all those specific peculiarities of 3D NAND will be addressed by us by bringing out the tools and options on the tools that will enable our customers to increase their yields and to make sure that they can do effective 3D NAND production.\nAnalysts: Got it. On a kind of related issue, I was wondering, are you seeing any evidence yet that with the traction of EUV, customers might be planning on ordering fewer immersion systems, which I guess is kind the whole point of introducing EUV in the longer term?\nExecutives: Yes. I think -- what I think, it's probably best is we look at our Analyst Day of 2016. We gave you a couple of scenarios where high EUV introduction, lower EUV introduction for several reasons. It could be EUV not as effective as we then, at that moment in time, planned or whether markets were different. And you can actually conclude from those scenarios that higher EUV will lead to somewhat lower immersion, but still significant. And it's logical because it will cannibalize some of the multiple patterning layers. On the other hand also, layers are growing, yes? So it also -- so basically, there is a dilutive effect in that sense that you have more layers, and some of those layers will be deep UV layers, will be the immersion layers. So no matter how you look at it, the number of EUV and of immersion systems will still remain significant, also with high EUV introduction. So -- this is I'd like to refer back to that -- to those 4 scenarios that we showed in the end of 2016.\nExecutives: And just to give you the numbers, I mean, these 4 scenarios had anything between 50 and 80 tools. And that -- right in the middle of that range, around 70, is what we're shipping right now. It's not -- in no case it is going down significantly.\nAnalysts: Right. So it's that you're saying it's too early, really, to judge the level of cannibalization of EUV to immersion?\nExecutives: Yes. There will be probably some. I mean, if we now look at a quite -- at a good EUV adoption, which is -- I think is a realistic assumption right now, then yes, there will be some effect on immersion tools. But it's not going to be significant.\nExecutives: I think, by the way, that if you look at over the lifetime, over a very long period, it's actually not cannibalizing immersion at all because EUV, at one point in -- without EUV at one point in time, there wouldn't be even new nodes. And if there's a new node, there will also always be layers for immersion. So if you don't get it at a very long period of time, it's actually not cannibalizing at all. It's actually keeping it alive.\nAnalysts: Yes, that's a good point.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini.\nAnalysts: Yes. Mehdi Hosseini from Susquehanna International. A couple of follow-up. Peter, how should I think about your DRAM customers that are planning for EUV? Would that take for you to hit that 2,000-wafer-per-day target before you see a step-up in booking activity? Or is there any other metric that I need to track? And any insight here would be great. And I have a couple of follow-ups.\nExecutives: Yes. I think it's not a surprise that DRAM devices are more cost sensitive than advanced logic. So it is true that the 2,000 wafers per day is -- we've said it before, is a realistic economic productivity target. I think if we meet that target or, let's say, on a continuous basis, it's our assessment that, that will be a very attractive economic entry point for DRAM. Now -- and how realistic is 2,000 wafers per day? With everything that we have on the road map today, I think it is realistic to be there by the end of the year. So now, that -- let's work very hard and execute on it and work very closely together with our customers to get to that point because that, of course, it will be only for a very few layers, but there's a lot of DRAM wafers. So that could give an extra impetus to our EUV story.\nAnalysts: Sure. Now I wanted to reconcile this with large-source capacity. How long will it take for ZEISS to add additional capacity? Do you have any flexibility to accelerate investment there or accelerate capacity, manufacturing capacity so that your 30-plus target for 2019 could increase? And I'm asking you this because if you're able to increase confidence among your DRAM customers that you can actually do 2,000 wafer per day, wouldn't they need to place a PO before '19? And wouldn't some of these EUV shipment would have to take place into DRAM customer by late '19? So doesn't that create a kind of a double-edged sword? And I want to get your view on the kind of levers that you can pull to accommodate these DRAM customers.\nExecutives: Yes. It's -- you're making -- you're asking very elaborate question, and I'll give you a very simple answer. The way that we -- the lead time to increase capacity at ZEISS has lapsed. I mean, we are where we are today. The only way to get 30-plus and how much the plus is, is dependent on the cycle time reduction in the factory of ZEISS. The faster they can do that and the better they can do that, the more we can squeeze out. Because everything else are long lead time items in terms of capacities, buildings, machines, people, training, the whole thing. That will not happen until 2020 and our output in 2020, which is their output in 2019. So that means we have what we have, yes? And that also means we are very transparent to our customers on the 2019 potential shipment plan and when those machines will come available. We're very transparent to every customer, and it's up to them to decide whether they want to take up that capacity. And there's very little we can do other than just working very hard with our ZEISS colleagues to keep reducing the cycle time to squeeze out a few extras. But that's what it is, and it's up to the customers to react on the transparency that we will give them.\nExecutives: And probably 2 clarifications, just in case I got your questions wrong. So you referred to the light source. Of course, the light source is not done at ZEISS. It's the optical system. And secondly, you seem to imply that DRAM EUV shipments would start late in 2019. We are already shipping EUV systems now. So I mean, it will also be in DRAM in high-volume manufacturing in 2019. Just so that's clear.\nAnalysts: Does the elaborate question give me a quick follow-up?\nExecutives: Yes, because [indiscernible] -- and we know it's your [indiscernible] -- for your [indiscernible] of time [indiscernible].\nAnalysts: Okay, great. You made an interesting point about the e-beam mask inspection. You said that you have already shipped your first tool. How should we think about a year or 2 from now? Should we assume that you actually can turn this into a volume production and actually help customers meet the inspection or mask inspection without relying on other vendors?\nExecutives: Well, yes. It's a fully equipped mask inspection tool. So it's an e-beam tool, it can be used for e-beam mask inspection. And the more EUVs is used in terms of layers, the more mask inspection tools are needed. So I think we just are going to deliver and ship in that market, and yes, it's what it is. And I think when we did the HMI acquisition last year, I think we also put a date, the year before in 2016. I think we did discuss the opportunity of e-beam mask inspection as a couple of hundred million euros of -- this is -- it is where it is, and I think the success of EUV will, of course, help us also penetrate that market.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ms. Tammy Qiu.\nAnalysts: Tammy Qiu from Berenberg. So the first question is on the cycle. I understand that based on your comment, 2018 is likely to be a nice year. I'm just wondering, what's your view on 2019 and what going to be the end market driver there?\nExecutives: Well, I've just sold my crystal ball, so I can't -- I really can't answer this, but it all depends on the end markets. I mean, the -- at least on the -- but just a more high-level answer is the proliferation and the penetration of IC devices into almost everything now is -- it actually makes it more volatile, I think, macroeconomics swings. So you want to talk about cycles, I think there will be macroeconomic cycles. I said it in the press conference this morning also, and -- but when that happens, I don't know, yes? The only thing is when it happens, we will be able to react up or down. And in your case, you seem to communicate what's the possibility of a downward question, I don't know. But when it happens, we have all the means and the flexibility to react.\nAnalysts: Okay. And the second question is, you talked about the EUV won't actually limit the demand for Deep UV. So in general, I would say, does that mean equipment have to become more and more expensive for the chip makers over time, so therefore they will have to keep buying the more expensive and more equipment for making a leading edge node? So I'm not sure how you view this point. Do you, as an equipment maker, need to cut the price at certain point so that they don't have to pay crazy CapEx all the time? Or can they actually pass on the incremental CapEx to their customers?\nExecutives: Well, what you're basically asking is, is Moore's Law still viable, yes? Because when I just -- well, just before the press conference, I bumped into one of the really senior ASML lab leads, and he said, \"You know, this is great where the company is going. I still remember sending out the first invoice for $1 million. Now we're selling a EUR 120 million tool.\" So to your point, yes, customers have started to pay a lot more for those tools. But of course, the transition and the cost per function has continuously gone down on a logarithmic scale, yes? So is Moore's Law viable? Yes, we believe it's still viable, and yes, our customers will pay higher price for our machines whereby the cost per function will keep going down.\nOperator: The next question will come from Mr. Andrew Gardiner.\nAnalysts: It's Andrew Gardiner from Barclays. We spent quite a bit of time talking about memory this afternoon. I was just wondering if we could spend a minute or 2 on logic and just in terms of the -- first on the near-term thinking through 2018 and the sort of strength or sort of node migration plans in place there. How do you view your sort of visibility into that logic business this year? I presume it's better or sort of firmer than we see in memory, where you seem to be highlighting the potential risk in the back half or, at least, lack of visibility in the back half. But how -- so where's your conviction level or -- to where a customer sort of order rates in terms of the 10 and 7 nanometer migrations?\nExecutives: Yes. I think what we've -- we haven't changed our view as compared to 1 or 2 quarters ago. I mean, the logic 10-nanometer ramp is still going, actually, to the areas in China, where we're shipping 14 and 28. And more importantly, I think what we will see is by the back half of the year, we'll start to see EUV going into 7-nanometer pilot production. This ramp, I think -- and also, if you look at the comments made by our customers and their assessment of the size of the nodes, there is no reason whatsoever to believe that they -- that there is an indication that those nodes will actually dwindle in terms of number of wafers that they would need to build that capacity. And on the contrary, I think comments are being made by customers on the 7 and 10-nanometer nodes as being very large nodes, and they're seeing a lot of [ date bounce ]. So there is no indication whatsoever to change our view. And like I said earlier and we look at the memory and the logic business, we see 2018 developing at least at the same level as 2017 for both logic and memory with some upside here and there.\nAnalysts: Okay. If I could just have a quick sort of accounting follow-up for Wolfgang. We're starting to see the sort of the ZEISS investment come through in terms of the equity income line. It was somewhat negative in the fourth quarter. Is there a rough rule of thumb we should be thinking of as we put that in our models for future periods?\nExecutives: Yes. The -- first of all for everybody, we had 2 agreements with ZEISS: one was a high NA investment agreement and one was an equity agreement. The high NA one, obviously, goes through our R&D line and also through our balance sheet as it relates to the CapEx. But as it relates to the equity investment, you will see that equity method investment on the balance sheet of about EUR 1 billion for the 24.9% that we own, and then you see 2 elements in our financial statements. First of all, you see in the P&L a profit that's attributed to those 24.9%, and therefore, the first quarter, you saw a negative EUR 17 million. And the second thing that you see is in our cash flow from investing. You see the dividend attributed to that investment, and you see that we received a dividend also for 3 months period of almost EUR 20 million. So the dividend is basically, since SMT basically distributes their earnings, a very good reflection of the profitability of that business. Now accounting makes this a little bit complicated because you need to do numerous things, but you start from a very healthy profit. And then you start off with, number one, the adjustment from IFRS to U.S. GAAP. Number two, you adjust for differences in accounting policies between the companies. But then number three is where it really hits you. Even though it's not an acquisition, you still need to do purchase price accounting. That means you need to write up the inventory to the fair market value. You need to identify intangibles. And then you do the same thing that what you have heard us talking about when we talked about HMI, you need to consume that inventory and you need to amortize these intangibles. And that takes your profit all the way to a EUR 17 million loss. Now as it relates to the future, this is something that will still be with us for a long time because these intangible has a lifetime of 15 years plus. But the inventory part, we will walk through within a year or so. So I think, net-net for 2018, this will still be a loss. And then in 2019, you will also see a profit on that line and then depreciate. And then the cash, of course, follows the true profit and cash flow of SMT. And from a cash flow perspective, you should see a much, much higher number every year.\nAnalysts: It wasn't such a good follow-up, sorry.\nExecutives: Yes, good one to end though. Ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one last question. If you were unable to get through on this call and still have questions, please feel free to contact the ASML Investor Relations department with your question. Now operator, may we have the last caller please?\nOperator: The final question will come from Mr. Robert Sanders.\nAnalysts: It's Deutsche Bank. I just had a last question on the EUV backlog. Just in terms of how many of those 28 tools are with the planned 251 configuration as opposed to -- I think it's 205 of the standard tool? And I have a follow-up.\nExecutives: All of them, because there will be -- even if it's -- we have the commitment to have all those tool ultimately to be at 251. But -- so in fact, they're all at the 251 configuration.\nAnalysts: I got it. So all of them will have an extra amount of money to be billed to the customer once you get up to 251 because that's beyond the spec, right?\nExecutives: No, because the spec is we need to do 251 to get the 125 wafers. So when we get over 251, we get more wafers out there, we get extra money. But 125 wafers is what we sold to them.\nAnalysts: Okay. And just last question for Wolfgang, just on the gross margin in 2018. Given what you said about being higher than, I think, 45%, is 45% to 46% a kind of good model number for our models for 2018? You can just give us a vague range, that'd be great.\nExecutives: I think we would have [ knocked ] the result if it's only extremely marginal, but I don't want to tie it down to a specific number at this point either. So we'll go through the year. And the more important thing is it will be a good step forward towards the 50 plus in 2020. That's really what we're working for.\nExecutives: Now on behalf of ASML's board and management, I would like to thank you all for joining us today. \nOperator, if you could formally conclude the call, I'd appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the ASML 2017 Fourth Quarter and Annual Financial Results Conference Call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."

         "ASML Holding N.V., Q1 2018 Earnings Call, Apr 18, 2018",
         "Executives: Mr. Nickl, the first quarter of 2018 was a solid quarter for ASML. Can you talk us through the numbers?\nExecutives: Yes, sure. We had another very good quarter. First of all, the revenue came in at almost EUR 2.3 billion. We had guided to EUR 2.2 billion. So solid overachievement. They are mainly driven by product mix and our DUV business. Memory was very strong. Memory represented 75% of system sales in the quarter. And the volume and the mix and the revenue translated itself also into good gross margin. We guided to 47% to 48%, and we came out at 48.7%. So also, a very, very good profitability. We shipped 3 EUV system, as we speak, 1 other shipment is on the way. So I think we can proudly say good start into the year and very solid quarter, again.\nExecutives: Does that mean that your outlook has changed for 2018?\nExecutives: Yes, we continue to have a view on 2018 that we expect very solid revenue and profitability growth. As if anything, I would say, that our view on the year is a bit more solid even than it was in January when we talk. This is, of course, driven by a very solid logic market. But also, memory, in particular, remains very, very strong, and we expect very, very strong year-over-year growth in the memory business. And all, by the way, we are having a very keen eye on capacity with development, and we don't see any systematic buildup of excess capacity there. So that looks pretty good. We have adjusted our view on the EUV shipments. We have previously talked about 22 systems. We have taken that down to 20 systems. That's a bit of a combination of our own capability, and the customer having shifted the fab readiness a little bit into the first quarter of next year. But you have heard us talking before about our year being back-end loaded, so we have produced this to 20 systems. Consequently, also, the revenue expectation is coming down from EUR 2.3 billion to about EUR 2.1 billion. But that delta is going to be more than made up by a strong DUV and applications business. So overall, we have a very, very good view on this year and solid expectation both from a revenue and from a profitability perspective.\nExecutives: Can you elaborate on your EUV business? How are you progressing in the EUV business?\nExecutives: I would say constant progress. So first of all, the customer is demanding the tool. We get another 9 orders in the first quarter. We are seeing constant progress. We shipped 10 tools in 2017. Now we are expecting to do 20 tools in 2018. And as we said before, we're going to do it at least 30 tools in 2019. So a very solid ramp. Customers are very excited about it. They've been very public about them inserting it into volume production at the end of this year. And even with 22 tools going to 20 tools will not really have an impact on their realm capability. So I think we are doing pretty well from the demand perspective. And we made progress on the tool itself. And particularly on productivity. We've demonstrated more than 125 wafers per hour at a customer now. And also, very importantly, as a leading indicator, we've also shown 140 wafers per hour here at ASML.\nExecutives: There's a new technology called high-NA EUV for which you already have 4 orders. What is high-NA EUV?\nExecutives: Yes, first for, yes, we got 4 orders, and by the way, they are not included in the 9 orders, I mentioned earlier. But it's even better than that. We get the 4 orders from 3 customers, but we also sold 8 options for early volume systems. The initial 4 orders for R&D, and those systems will start shipping at the end of 2021. The early volume shipments will ship closer to 2024, also. So our customers are very excited about it because high-NA essentially prolongs their road maps, it gives them the opportunity to continue to reduce the cost per function, and it continues, by the way, all the way through the next decade and beyond. So now what is high-NA? It's an evolution of EUV. We're extending the numerical aperture, which goes from 0.33 to 0.55. So that eventually will mean a better resolution and better overlay. So just to give you a feeling. The high-NA machines overlay and resolution will be about 70% better than the latest EUV machine that we're shipping right now. But also, due to innovation on the optics, but also, the wafer and the radical stage, we're getting better throughput. So we're thinking 185 wafers per hour. So it's an extremely valuable tool for the customers. We are very excited because we did the prior investment in size. We now have the commitment from the customer and the customer can use the tool to extend their solutions beyond the next decade. So it's a very, very good achievement this first quarter.\nExecutives: And then you have another business, the application business. How are things progressing over there?\nExecutives: Applications are doing very well. It all starts with the YieldStar business. YieldStar is our overly metrology system. It's finding continued adoption, has always been very prominent in logic applications, but we now see increasing adoption in memory as well. So that's going very well. And of course, we have the synergy products from the HMI acquisition. We shipped several ePfm5. Remember those are the systems that help us to find systematic issues on a wafer. And we have first feedback from the customers, they got first data sets and they would look -- they look very, very promising. The extension will then be a multibeam system, creating a really good market opportunity for e-beam, and that is to find the random issues on the wafer. And there, we have a prototype system that use as a 3 by 3. So 9 beam, and we kept the first pictures with that. So that's also going, along our plan, our plan time line. And with that, we are confident that the applications business will actually over the next several years outgrow the rest of our business. So good progress on all fronts, so to speak.\nAnalysts: Mr. Nickl, the first quarter of 2018 was a solid quarter for ASML. Can you talk us through the numbers?\nExecutives: Yes. Sure. We had another very good quarter. First of all, the revenue came in at almost EUR 2.3 billion. We had guided to EUR 2.2 billion. It's a solid overachievement. They are mainly driven by product mix in our DUV business. Memory was very strong. Memory represented 75% of system sales in the quarter.

But also, memory, in particular, remains very, very strong, and we expect very, very strong year-over-year growth in the memory business. And oh, by the way, we are having a very keen eye on capacity with development, and we don't see any systematic buildup of excess capacity there. So that looks pretty good. We have adjusted our view on the EUV shipment. So we have previously talked about 22 systems. We have taken that down to 20 systems.

The early volume shipments will ship closer to 2024 also. So our customers are very excited about it because High-NA essentially prolongs their road maps. It gives them the opportunity to continue to reduce the cost per function, and it continues, by the way, all the way through the next decade and beyond. So now what is High-NA?

         "ASML Holding N.V., Q1 2018 Earnings Call, Apr 18, 2018",
         "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the ASML 2018 First Quarter Financial Results Conference Call on April 18, 2018. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to open the question-and-answer queue. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference call over to Skip Miller. Go ahead, please, sir.\nExecutives: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. This is Skip Miller, Vice President, Investor Relations at ASML. Joining me today from ASML headquarters in Veldhoven, the Netherlands is ASML CEO, Peter Wennink; and CFO, Wolfgang Nickl. The subject of today's call is ASML's 2018 first quarter results. Length of this call will be 60 minutes, and questions will be taken in the order that they were received. This call is also being broadcast live over the Internet at asml.com. A transcript of management's opening remarks and a replay of the call will be available on our website shortly following the conclusion of this call. \nBefore we begin, I'd like to caution listeners that comments made by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities law. These forward-looking statements involve material risks and uncertainties. For a discussion of risk factors, I encourage you to review the safe harbor statement contained in today's press release and presentation found on our website at asml.com and in ASML's annual report on Form 20-F and other documents as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. \nWith that, I would like to turn the call over to Peter Wennink for a brief introduction.\nExecutives: Thank you, Skip. Good morning and good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining us for our Q1 2018 results conference call. Before we begin the question-and-answer session, Wolfgang and I would like to provide an overview and some commentary on the first quarter as well as provide our view of the coming quarters. Wolfgang will start with a review of our Q1 financial performance with added comments on our short-term outlook. I will complete the introduction with some additional comments, the current business environment and our future business outlook. \nWolfgang, if you will.\nExecutives: Thank you, Peter, and welcome, everyone. I will first highlight some of the first quarter accomplishments and then provide our guidance for the second quarter of 2018. Q1 net sales came in at EUR 2.29 billion, somewhat stronger than guided, driven by product mix and a strong EUV business. Net system sales of EUR 1.67 billion was primarily strong memory revenue, which contributed 74% of sales. Logic, which now combined foundry and IDM sales, made up 26% of system sales. Installed Base Management sales for the quarter came in at EUR 617 million, which was just above our guidance. Gross margin for the quarter came in at 48.7%, which was 70 basis points above the upper end of our guidance range, driven by both volume and mix. Overall OpEx came in slightly above guidance with R&D expense at EUR 357 million and SG&A expenses at EUR 114 million. \nTurning to the balance sheet. We ended last quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at a level of EUR 3.19 billion. During the quarter, we purchased approximately EUR 117 million worth of shares. This means we still have EUR 2.33 billion of our 2018, 2019 share buyback program remaining. \nMoving to the order book. Q1 system bookings came in at a strong EUR 2.44 billion. 57% of the order intake was from logic customers, driven by EUV. Memory made up the remaining 43% of our order volume, driven by Deep UV. We took 9 new EUV orders in the quarter. Additionally, we received 4 orders for High-NA R&D systems from 3 customers. And on top of this, we sold options for 8 High-NA early volume systems. High-NA is our next-generation EUV system, which will enable geometrical shrink beyond the next decade. \nThe initial selling price for these High-NA systems is around EUR 270 million. We will receive 40% as a down payment, and the remaining 60% will be milestone-based, with the majority of the milestone payments expected before shipment. The options were sold for EUR 50 million each with payments starting this year. \nAt this point, I would like to comment on our reporting of bookings and [indiscernible] going forward. As we have communicated a number of times in the past, we established our joint demand forecast as our customers very routine and comprehensive planning cycles. Order flow can be lumpy, and therefore, does not always reflect our business accurately. We believe reporting bookings and backlog provide limited value, and therefore, backlog will no longer be reported. If we want to provide some additional visibility during our initial EUV ramp phase, we will continue to report bookings throughout this year. We currently plan to no longer report bookings beginning in 2019. \nWith that, I would like to turn to our expectations and guidance for the second quarter of 2018. We expect Q2 total net sales between EUR 2.5 billion and EUR 2.6 billion. Our total net sales forecast includes almost EUR 600 million for our EUV business, while we target to ship 3 EUV systems in the quarter. Our Q2 EUV revenue forecast is a combination of revenue upon shipment and deferred revenue from prior quarters. This catch-up of deferred revenue was previously forecasted for the second half of the year. \nOn EUV revenue guidance, we have communicated that we will provide quarterly guidance until we are recognizing the majority of revenue for a system at the time of its shipment. We expect this to happen in Q2 and will therefore no longer provide quarterly EUV revenue guidance starting in 2019. \nFor the full year, our shipment plan have changed from 22 to 20 EUV systems. The change was due to a combination of anticipated end-of-year shipment logistic challenges\n[Audio Gap]\nwill not impact customers' EUV production ramp plans. As a result of this adjustment, our EUV revenue for 2018 is now expected to be around EUR 2.1 billion, [indiscernible] EUR 2.3 billion that we had indicated previously. \nI would like to highlight though that we expect this reduction to be more than compensated by stronger DUV and applications businesses. We expect our Q2 Installed Base Management revenue to again come in around EUR 600 million. Gross margin for the quarter is expected to be around 43% impacted by the significant increase in EUV sales in the quarter. R&D expenses for Q2 will reflect continued accelerated investments in our portfolio and will come in at around EUR 375 million. SG&A is expected to come in at about EUR 115 million. \nWe have started a new share buyback program for 2018 and 2019 of up to EUR 2.5 billion in Q1 of EUR 170 million worth of shares were repurchased. Additionally, we have also proposed a 17% increase in our dividend to EUR 1.40 per share to our Annual Shareholder Meeting, which takes place on April 25 here in Veldhoven. The dividend payment is valued at around EUR 600 million. \nWe are excited about 2018. Customers' demand for our products continues to be strong with strengthening demand in DUV as well as applications. In addition, we see strong demand for EUV as customers ramp this technology in production and committed to this next-generation technology. We look forward to a year of continued strong growth in both revenue and profitability. \nWith that, I would like to turn the call back over to you, Peter.\nExecutives: Thank you, Wolfgang. I would like to start off by announcing a major milestone reached this quarter. We got our next-generation EUV technology, both high aperture or high NA. We have aligned our development time line with customers, and we received orders for 4 High-NA R&D systems from 3 leading semiconductor manufacturers targeted to start shipping in Q4 2021. We also saw that the customers' options to buy 8 early volume systems targeted to start shipping in 2024. This is a significant milestone in that it demonstrates customers' commitment to EUV technology for future nodes and provides great growth opportunity as we extend lithography technology beyond the next decade. \nI will highlight some of the key product features in more detail later, but I would like to first address our view of the business and the demand drivers. As Wolfgang highlighted and a good start to the year, and our business continues to perform very well. The positive industry environment and increasing litho intensity as customers migrate to more advanced nodes continues to drive strong demand for our products in both logic and memory markets. Although this not -- this does not come as a surprise, we're increasingly optimistic about our 2018 outlook as compared to a quarter ago as we see strengthening demand in memory while logic demand remains solid. Based on expected growth and current guidance, we expect to see significant increase in revenue in the second half of the year and [indiscernible] strong Deep UV will be primarily driven by memory and strong EUV will be primarily driven by logic. We plan to ship to over 15 greenfield fabs in 2018. It maybe interesting to note that of these fabs, the majority will be in the China region, of which 7 are for domestic Chinese customers. Memory strength in both DRAM and NAND is driven by increasing content as well as expanding end market applications. In DRAM, our customers continue to migrate to the 1x nanometer node along with required wafer capacity additions to meet the increased bit demand. In NAND, the number of customers continue to ramp greenfield -- new greenfield fabs and scale vertically via stacks-of-stacks, which requires additional lithography. With strengthening demand in both DRAM and NAND, we see significant year-over-year growth. Based on current third-party estimates for both DRAM and NAND, bit demand growth against our view of bit supply growth, we don't see major concerns regarding supply-demand balance throughout the year. \nLogic demand continues to be solid as customers ramp 10- and 7-nanometer nodes. While the initial demand for the latter, the 7-nanometer node, is th primary driver behind the significant increase in EUV demand in this year. \nOn the ASML product side, let me start with an update of our EUV business. In EUV, we continue to make progress as this technology starts to ramp in volume production. We delivered a configuration that achieved 125 wafers per hour at a customer site and continue to drive improvements in throughput performance, demonstrating 140 wafers per hour at ASML factories. We continue to focus on improving availability and work with our customers in support of infrastructure around EUV and volume production. from our customers continues to be strong and to start ramping this technology in production. With the plan of 20 shipments in 2018, this represents a doubling of our over last year's shipments. As we now move into the volume phase of this new technology ramp, we will focus our operations and industrialization efforts on managing our supply chain and helping our customers with their fab readiness preparations. As Wolfgang mentioned, we have shifted 2 systems to early 2019 due to a combination of customer fab readiness and anticipated challenges regarding the logistics of around year-end shipments. However, based on our discussions with customers, our previously communicated estimates of their EUV layer adoption plans remain unchanged. As a reflection of their continued commitment to EUV production plans, we took orders for 9 NXE:3400 systems this quarter in support of our 2019 shipment plan of at least 30 systems. \nAs mentioned in my introduction, High-NA is our next-generation EUV technology, which extends lithography and enables cost-effective scaling beyond the next decade. The NA of the new optical system will increase from 0.33 current EUV systems to 0.55 on High-NA systems. In addition to new advanced optics driving improvements in imaging, platform innovations in stage technology will drive improvements in overlay and productivity. We're currently targeting an initial increase in productivity to 185 wafers per hour. Last year's investments in Carl Zeiss SMT will further solidify our development time line and reduce the execution risk. And with the addition of High-NA, ASML's product portfolio will include [ 0.30 ] NA, 0.55 NA \nEUV, right and immersion Deep UV, line as well as holistic products, all designed to work together seamlessly in production. \nIn Deep UV, we will increase our factory output to meet the market demand. Furthermore, our focus on productivity we continue to boost our new system output, and we expect to exceed the record productivity level reached last year. In addition to increasing the maximum configuration output per system, we are also continuously increasing productivity of our systems in the field. For instance, we achieved an output of 6,000 wafers per day on NXT systems in a NAND fab, which translates to a 5% increase in productivity over a 12-month period. With both increased system shipment output as well as productivity increases of systems in the fab, we are delivering further value to our customers via capacity and cost efficiency. \nIn Holistic Lithography, we continue to see growth across our full portfolio of software in metrology products. Our YieldStar metrology continues to gain broadening adoption at recent growth via expansion in the memory market. We also shipped our first YieldStar 1375 system, which measures actual in-device lithography performance, enabling more accurate measurements of the device and thus driving yield improvements. We've shipped multiple Pattern Fidelity metrology tools [ in 5 ] and are seeing initial positive customer results. This technology where ASML's high-resolution technology is combined with our computational lithography software will enable e-beam-based feedback to the scanner and deliver improved yield performance in volume production. To further drive EUV productivity performance and expand application opportunity in volume production, we are developing multi-beam technology. We successfully captured first images from our 3-by-3 beam proof-of-concept system. We see great growth opportunity in holistic litho business and expect its growth rate to exceed our overall revenue growth in the coming years. \nTo summarize, this year, we expect solid growth in both sales and profitability. We are more optimistic about our feel of the yields than we were a quarter ago due to the continue strengthening of memory demand while logic demand continues to be solid. We are on track to achieve our 2020 targets with significant growth potential beyond 2020. We plan to communicate our growth opportunity beyond 2020 at our Investor Day on November 8 this year. \nAnd so last but not least, as many of you know, this quarterly call is the last call with Wolfgang online helping us to bring clarity to our results and operations. we are saying we have ASML. We'll miss him dearly, and we'd like to take the opportunity to thank him wholeheartedly for his invaluable contribution to ASML. Wish him all the best in his new challenge at Bayer, and we will follow him closely he can rest assured. \nAnd with that, we will be happy to take your questions.\nExecutives: All right. Thank you, Wolfgang and Peter. Ladies and gentlemen, the operator will instruct you momentarily on the protocol for the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] Now operator, we have your final instructions and then the first question, please?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Mr. Farhan Ahmad.\nAnalysts: Farhan Ahmad From Credit Suisse. My first question is in regards to China. Did I hear correctly that now you're seeing [ 7 ] domestic companies in China whereas on the last call, you had mentioned 5. Can you just talk about what customer activity are you seeing in China? And how is it split between memory and logic, foundry?\nExecutives: Yes. I think China is a rapidly developing market, but I have to tell you that these are -- like we said in the prepared remarks, these are greenfield fabs of different sizes. They're also 200-millimeter fabs. They are 200-millimeter initiatives. So it is basically expands across all segments. It's logic, DRAM, NAND, logic being foundry. There's DRAM initiatives, there is NAND initiatives. So it's the -- I would say, it's the entire breadth of the business that we're covering. And yes, it is moving, but we have to say these are greenfield fabs, which have a different pattern or an expected different pattern of ramping. Many of those fabs put in a first line to qualify the process, to qualify first product, which will take some time. So we have to be careful with -- although the number is significant, 7, we have to be a bit careful with the assessment of the speed with which they will ramp up, which will be a function of the successes that they have in qualifying process and product.\nAnalysts: Got it. And then one quick question on the sustainability of memory shipments that you are seeing this year. On your comments, you talked about the sustainability. Can you talk about some of the analytics that you have done that give you confidence that the memory demand that you're seeing is sustainable? And also, if I look at your Others, the Others in memory had declined a lot. Is that an indication that the customers are being disciplined in how they're ordering? And even though the memory industry profitability is very high, the kind of building to meet the demand that they're seeing?\nExecutives: Yes. First, to talk about memory and the split between DRAM and NAND, the way that we calculate this is that, of course, we don't know what the bit demand will be. So we focus -- basically, we use the available data from industry analysts, and we corroborate that with discussions that we have with customers and see how customers see this. I must admit that personally, sometimes view that we're parroting after each other. We're all using the same percentages [indiscernible] as there's not a lot of difference there. So this on the bit demand side. Now what we know better is the bit supply side. We know pretty well how many tools are out there. We know pretty well how they are used in terms of availability and throughput. We pretty know -- we know pretty well what kind of technology is actually used, so we can calculate the bit supply pretty well as installed and as planned to be shipped. Now with DRAM, that's pretty accurate because we know it pretty well. With NAND, it's a bit of a caveat there. We have to make certain assumptions on the mix of layer stacks and the timing of when they increase layer stacks. And of course, some assumptions on the yields that they are having. Now you could argue that ASML might not be the most or the best positioned company to have an insight in there, but we work with what we know and what we hear. So this is what we then use basically, applying the same methodologies with DRAM, making how many systems do we have in the field, what's the productivity, what is our assumption on the mix of the layer stacks out there and so on. Yield assumption -- and that's how we come to this view that we currently have that supply and demand are pretty much in balance for this year, taking into account the caveats, which I think a little bit more caveats in there than there are in DRAM as far as our insights are concerned. On the order trends, actually, you're giving exactly the argument why we stop giving order guidance because it -- you can draw easily very strange conclusions for it. I mean, the way that we plan our shipments is an 18 months in-depth view with our customers on their expansion plans, on their capacity rollout plans and of technology transitions. And orders come in from a very few customers in batches. So it doesn't say anything. When we give you guidance on what we believe the memory business, it is based not on the order flow. It is based on the continued discussion we have with our customers on their ramp-up plans that technology transitions, and that really drives our view of the business, not the order intake.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mr. Sandeep Deshpande.\nAnalysts: I have 2 questions. Firstly, for Wolfgang. I'm trying to understand the R&D guidance that you've given. The R&D guidance for Q2 is higher than the 2020, even if you took an absolute amount on your 2020 guidance 13% [ of 11 ] billion. On a quarterly basis, it is higher. Why it is higher? And sustainably remain higher? And secondly, if it is going to remain higher, why are you not capitalizing some of these R&D, given that he said in his prepared remarks that some of these shipments on High-NA EUV really going to happen in 2024, et cetera. So it's a very long way away. And secondly, Peter, I have a question overall on the High-NA EUV business. Is the cost structure any different with -- in High NA EUV, given that Carl Zeiss is going to be such an important supplier there? I mean, clearly, it's an important on top of that even more important start. And I'd like to thank you, Wolfgang, for all your support over the last few years while you were CFO of ASML.\nExecutives: Thanks, Sandeep. As it relates to R&D, we have taken the investments up. We're very heavily investing in High-NA, both here at ASML and through our High-NA agreement [indiscernible]. But we're also investing heavily in Holistic Lithography in the guided beam and the multibeam solutions. We do a firmly keep our 13% of revenue and below in mind, and we're not going to be quite there this year, but we're going to make progress year-over-year in terms of revenue that will keep that in front of us. As it relates to the capitalization, that's a function of the accounting rules. And as you know, when we talk to you, we talk based on our U.S. GAAP numbers. And there, you simply have to expense it. If you're interested in the capitalized version, you can always look at our IFRS numbers that we don't use internally in the management process where they get capitalized. Quite frankly, at the end of the day, it's all about cash flow. And there, you don't have a difference. We manage ourselves based on the U.S. GAAP numbers, which we also, quite frankly, like because it's a bit more conservative, yes.\nExecutives: On your second question, will there be a different cost structure on the High-NA EUV business. I think from a product cost, yes. I think the structure will be in there. Of course, it will be EUVs in there. But I think in terms of the cost buildup, it will be somewhat different to start with the optics. I think we explained this before. We've taken an equity interest in Carl Zeiss, but also we've agreed with them that we will hold funds their R&D as well as their CapEx. And they way that we get repaid on that funding is that we run this as 2 companies and one business kind of venture. So it means to that we should both have an equal internal rate of return. Only, as you can imagine, if we put significantly more absolute euros in there than they do, then of course, as somehow you need to get an absolute year-over-year return, which is also significantly higher. And the way that we balance this or we compensate this is through the lens price. So it actually means that it's a pretty investment, whereby if you get a discount on the lens price to get a return on your investment. So that's one, and that's different than what we do today. And secondly, we use a -- we will use with High-NA the same source, the same EUV source, which is the source that we're currently using also for 0.33 NA. So all that, you could say a learning curve of that cost price of the current source will be captured by the time that we start shipping High-NA. I think those will be the 2 main drivers for different cost structure in High-NA as compared to 0.33 NA, which should have a positive impact on the gross margin to start with.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mr. [indiscernible]\nAnalysts: It's actually Alex Duval from Goldman Sachs. Just wanted to clarify very quickly what you said in terms of the High-NA orders and option sales. Can I just clarify that you said the average selling price is actually EUR 170 million for the original [ to ] sale? And therefore, how should we be thinking about the total amount of cash that you'll be getting from those initial 4 orders and when we get that?\nExecutives: Alex, so just to be clear, 270, EUR 270 million is the initial price of this tool. And the way how the arrangement has been done on the R&D tools is that we get 40% right away. And then there are 6 equal milestone-based payments that will happen for the next couple of years. And like I said in the prepared remarks, we expect the majority of these payments will be in before the shipment actually happens. And then on top of that, we sold 8 options for early volume shipments and go with 50, 5 0, EUR 50 million apiece, and those shipments start this year. So it does exactly what we designed it for. We go through an accelerated development program to get this new technology as soon as possible. And our customers help us with the cash flow because we talked about R&D, and we talked about our assistance in the ZEISS business. So I think those are the most important parameters around the cash flow.\nAnalysts: Helpful. And just as a very quick follow-up. You obviously talked about these very high ASPs for High-NA. But there will be new iterations as a current generation of EUV, as I understand it, before we get to High-NA in coming years. So could you help us understand, should there be price inflation on these EUV machines in the meantime? And how should we think about that in the next couple of years?\nExecutives: Well, we will do what we always do. I mean, when you provide more value to the customer, we actually look at what that means for them in terms of the litho cost per wafer or litho cost per transistor, how you want to calculate it. And in fact, we just split -- that value increased 50-50. We've always done that. We've done that since the inception of the company. And of course, value is driven by productivity. This is why productivity improvements in the current EUV and NA will happen over time, in the next couple of years. And that will drive also the value, which we're going to split with our customers.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mr. C.J. Muse.\nAnalysts: I guess, Peter, first question, you got the longest lead time equipment in the industry. So curious if you think about announced and unannounced greenfield capacity as well as emerging spend out of China, could you talk about visibility and how you're thinking about 2019? I know it's only April, but would love to hear your thoughts.\nExecutives: You're talking about 2019 for the total business or for China?\nAnalysts: Sorry, the question was specific to your Deep UV business in aggregate. As you take into account visibility you have plus your longer lead times.\nExecutives: Yes, I think you have to -- I think it's way too early to go anything and to start guiding to 2019. But just qualitatively, it's all driven by 2 things. It's a technology transitions. I think the technology transitions 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer, they need significant amount of Deep UV machines. The 7-nanometer node, as Mark also mentioned, is in the minds of a lot of people. 10/7 is a big node. So -- but that -- the context of big, you need to see in the context of the end demand. And so you're currently seeing memory, for instance, is also a big user of our Deep UV systems and is driven by their demand out of the data centers. So it is really a question what you're asking is really the question about will we -- do we believe that the end demand will stick. It's strong today. Will it stick in 2019? I think the general belief, and I'm quoting also customers, is that they believe that it actually will, that the technology transitions will indeed happen. So the Deep UV demand for 2019 will be strong. That's our -- that's what we currently feel, yes? Now like I said, the end markets are really driving the ultimate demand for capacity extensions. And of course, we don't have a crystal ball. You don't have it, and just have to see how that will develop over the next couple of quarters.\nAnalysts: Sure. That's helpful. And I guess, as my follow-up, on the EUV side, I guess, 2 quick ones if I could sneak it in there. The first part is how do we think about gross margins into the second half given the pulling of some of the deferred revenues. And then given that you pushed 2 tools into 2019, should we infer that 32 could be the new number? Or is that just not reasonable?\nExecutives: I think it's right to assume that we're steadily increasing the margin. I mean, we're not spelling it out anymore because of movements between quarters and also how the gross margin is done and how we sell to customers. But in general, that is indeed the case, and we've also talked about our EUV business. I mean, you have seen the first half, we were over 150 in first quarter 600, in the -- almost 600 in the second quarter. It was 2.1 for the year so you see [ 2 heavy ] quarters coming. So you can clearly assume that the margin is going up.\nExecutives: Yes. On the shift of the 2 systems, yes, I mean, if you do -- if we [indiscernible] before [indiscernible] 32, I think I can do that math. But you have to realize that we're looking into 2019 where we really need to also understand the cutoff. At the end of 2019, I don't know exactly what we're going to happen because we're not fully booked for 2019 yet. So I think to be -- to stay on the safe side, I will just say we said we are planning for shipping our capacity of 30 units [indiscernible] for the time being stay at the 30 units.\nOperator: In the next question comes from Mr. Mehdi Hosseini.\nAnalysts: Peter, just as a follow-up, 7-nanometer plus wasn't supposed to lead to any meaningful changes of design as it relates to the EUV insertion. It had more to do with the demand side. But 5-nanometer is going to have some implication or improvement, especially wit the layout. When do you expect your customers will be able to provide for those design libraries with the EUV insertion that would enable design community to better understand the cost benefit of EUV?\nExecutives: I think actually, that's pretty fast and is already as a key attention for our customers. I mean, that question really to ask our customers. We can give you some qualitative indication. I mean, when we talk to our customers, they actually are very happy with the progress that they're making on their  5-nanometer designs also using EUV. As we said before, it reduces the complexity. So I think we got some very good feedback there. Although we, of course, don't know exactly where we are with that customers and how they present their designs and their libraries to their customers. But we don't know. But the sounds that we're getting out of the customer base are optimistic. And I think it's corroborated by what they say publicly. Listen to our major customers and what they say about EUV, I mean, it's pretty bullish. So -- and that's the only thing I can say. I mean, we get similar feedback from us today are publicly stating.\nAnalysts: And just a quick follow-on on DRAM. Last call, you talked about trying to target 2,000 wafer per day throughput as a milestone for getting your DRAM customers incrementally [indiscernible] adoption of EUV. Where are we with those targets? And any incremental color on DRAM adoption of EUV, especially as you -- as we go 1x to 1y. There's only 1- or 2-nanometer decline. And I'm not sure about the cost benefit and is that impacting in the context of throughput target if you could provide any incremental color, would be great.\nExecutives: Yes. I think we've always said, DRAM introduction will be for 1 or 2 layers, and it really depends on the specific customer's situation what they will go for. I think -- but you're right. I think the 2,000 wafer per day is kind of generally accepted target in the DRAM space because of the lower cost that they can, of course, for their devices. I think 2,000 wafers per day is a function of -- now, the wafer per hour throughput, which as we said we actually reached [ 125 ] and at the customer's side 40 wafers per hour here at ASML. So that's good. And then it's a function of the availability, which is -- actually, we have a clear target of going over 90%. We're executing on that target with some good achievements made over the last quarter, especially on the collected degradation. We're getting the collected degradation and consults, so we are a little bit ahead of our target there. So -- and we're rolling out several improvements availability improvement, as we speak, which actually mean that we have some major upgrades ongoing in the field. So if you would take average availability today, that is hampered also by the fact that we have to take tools down to do those upgrades. So -- but that all looks very much target to reach our over 90% availability when customers need it.\nAnalysts: But that incremental improvement isn't enough to get you [indiscernible] by 2019 shipment?\nExecutives: That remains to be seen. I mean, like I said, 1 to 2 layers, [indiscernible] going to be 2 layers is up to the customers to this and we're early in Q2 of 2018. I think customers will change their minds as they see performance going up in the course of this year. I think that's what they will do. So they'll very likely, and now I'm a bit assessing the situation. Of course, they won't tell us everything in detail, but they will have plan A and plan B, which is a 1-layer application or a 2-layer application. And that really depends on the progress that we'll see throughout the year, and that will drive their implementation in 2019. But like I said, we our targets -- we're on our way to meet our targets for 2,000 wafers per day for the DRAM application. There are many availability solutions that we're currently rolling out into the field. So throughout the year, we'll know more.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mr. Andrew Gardiner.\nAnalysts: Andrew Gardiner from Barclays. I had another one on EUV, perhaps more on the demand side than the so your capacity supply side. Peter, a couple of quarters ago, you had said that the theoretical demand you were seeing from customers was about 30% above the [ 30-tool ] capacity that you had for 2019. There's quite a few questions out there in the market about sort of levels of commitments, levels of layers. You just said that customers are confident and they're comfortable with the progress that you guys are making. And so therefore, you haven't seen any change in that in your expectation of the layers. So is -- [ 2 ] quarters on from when you first heard that, is the demand level for 2019 still at that kind of a level, so far outstripping the capacity today?\nExecutives: Yes. I think it is still over that capacity number. It is changing from time to time, up or down, because of the timing that our customers are currently they are looking at for their ramp. Because it is not only whether you use 6 or use 10 layers, but it's also what is the wafer capacity that you are going to build. So I think there is some changes back and forth, up and down, which is driven more by how much wafer capacity do they want to build. That has less to do with the technology, but moreover the end demand. And that is still above our capacity -- build capacity.\nAnalysts: Okay. I suppose to put it another way then so from a logic point of view, the 10 layers or more, you still stick to that sort of layer count expectation?\nExecutives: Yes. But that is a method of how big is the end market. So it's also a how quickly do they want to ramp to a certain first phase of that node, yes? So that is also, of course, determining whether how much the end demand will be over our capacity.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mr. Is Pierre Ferragu.\nAnalysts: It's Pierre Ferragu from Research. And just like to get back, Peter, on what you said about the memory markets where you have like a very good and capacity is building up and you see it's meeting very well the capacity demand. My question is, it seems that it's costing way more in terms of today than it was a few years ago because your revenues from memory are very significant. So could you explain us, I mean, is there any way to explain us why increase bits capacity the industry needs to spend more today than it was maybe a few years ago. Is that because shrink is delivering less bit growth and [indiscernible] more capacity? And is that something you see as a new normal as something that will be sustainable over time?\nExecutives: Well, it is clear that they are spending more now than in the few years ago in terms of litho tools. It doesn't mean that your cost per bit goes up because you're actually shrinking so your cost per bit even, if you spend more on litho and on equipment, no need to explain to you. But then your cost per bit still goes up and then goes down. But what we're currently seeing, and I think that's kind of a long time that we've seen memory price, especially DRAM prices, staying very strong and even growing. While you could argue the cost of manufacturing goes up. That tells you something. I mean, we've always said that memory is a commodity, and a commodity is a high-price elasticity. Well, the price elasticity when prices go up doesn't mean that the demand goes down. No, it's just the opposite. I think the demand is extremely high, and that means even customers and customers are willing to pay the high prices. So for our memory customers, it's an easy choice. You have in that market that once your product more than you can deliver, which actually means you buy the capacity, which may be at higher wafer cost. But your margins are significantly higher because of the market situation. So it is just business. They will buy what they need if the end market is there. And what you will see if the end market is not there, they will buy less and they will just squeeze everything out of the installed base. So I don't see the issue. I don't think customers see issues. Because they see the end markets. They see their public margins. the see the opportunities. We don't see, certainly not in the DRAM space, an exaggerated buildup of supply so they buy what they need. And it cost a bit more, but they also earn more.\nAnalysts: Okay. And that's very. So it [indiscernible] comes down, but it's just over time, gets translates into more spending in lithography. And then maybe more specifically on NAND, you mentioned like plans you started adding to their stack on 3D NAND, increasing the number of layers. Do you have an early insight on whether stacking up NAND like that is delivering as promised in terms of what you're seeing in the cost per bit. Do you have visibility on that already?\nExecutives: The cost per bit, when you stack and when you use historical yield assumptions for this type of device, then it's clear, the cost per bit goes down, yes? So from a lithography point of view, it is also clear to us there will be stack-of-stacks. Whatever customer confirms, now the big question is after how many stacks do you need another? How many layers do you need enough stack? That might be different customer per customer. But that's the thing that is certain to us. So yes, cost per bit will go down with vertical scaling. But like I said earlier, the ultimate cost is also a function of a couple of things, and one of the very important thing is, of course, yields. When yields go up, cost per bit goes up. It's that simple.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mr. Dave Mulholland.\nAnalysts: This is David Mulholland from UBS. Just quickly on the -- you made a comment earlier to say you're still increasing your DUV capacity. And I guess, over the next year or 2, as you start to ramp up EUV and volume more significantly, this general expectation DUV will go into decline. So just wondering if you can help us understand how you think about your DUV business for the next couple of years and why increased capacity now in that context.\nExecutives: Yes, I think when we say we increase capacity, don't think about adding square meters, building factories and putting tooling in. I mean, it's really, yes, to get a bit more people in because you're just work somewhat longer hours. But the most important part is operational efficiency. So you're reducing cycle time in the factory and basically getting more machines out using at the same fixed costs. That's how you do it.\nAnalysts: Okay. So it's not to say that you certainly got a more optimistic view on [indiscernible] on 2-, 3-year view.\nExecutives: No. I think we are increasing capacity because the customer demand is there. Like I said, you can't do it is in couple of ways by taking the long route and basically building a factory and hiring people and don't change your processes or you can drive down cycle times and just get more out of this same square meters. And that's what we're doing today.\nAnalysts: That's clear. And then just coming back on the EUV High-NA discussion. You've made a few comments on value and pricing but just obviously, there's been quite a challenging ramp from a gross margin perspective as the initial ramp of EUVs come in. Do you expect that we'll see a similar challenge as we start to introduce High-NA start low and then increase? Or will it be starting from a much better starting point given what you've already learned on EUV as we transition to High-NA?\nExecutives: Yes, we'll start NAND much better start at a point. You will always see that the first tools have a lower gross margin than the tools when you're in volume because you have the learning curve and warranty that goes with that, which is always higher with the first tools. But like I said earlier, we have this agreement on our internal investment of the R&D and the CapEx we do with Carl Zeiss, which will translate into a reduction, a discount on the optics, which is of the most expensive part of the entire tool. And the EUV source is the same source as we use in 0.33. So that learning curve will have kicked in by the time that we start shipping the High-NA tools.\nOperator: Next question comes from Mr. Douglas Smith.\nAnalysts: It's Doug Smith from Agency Partners. I saw that the wafer throughput for High-NA was actually higher than for low NA at 185 wafers per hour. Does that mean that the 2 low NA and High-NA won't coexist, that High-NA will just take over eventually?\nExecutives: That's a good question. I mean, it used to be the case that when you introduce a new technology that you see a kind of cannibalization of the previous one, which will not be the case for High-NA EUV. High-NA EUV will be used for the critical layers. It will be an expensive tools, [ 2 68 ], but it will be provided only more productivity also the geometrical shrink, as Wolfgang mentioned. So it means for those layers where you need the shrink, you will apply the High-NA tool. For those layers where you don't need that shrink capability of a High-NA tool, you will use the 0.33 tool. So it's going be a mix and match. Everything that you're going to see and discussing with customers is going to be mix and match of 0.33 and the 0.55 NA tool. So that means that the 0.33 EUV tool will have a very long life.\nAnalysts: Okay. Pretty clear. And one quick question. The metrology inspection business look like it had a pretty small quarter. Are there some issues going on in that business?\nExecutives: I don't know how you come to that conclusion. We had -- of course, the whole business is within our systems number and [indiscernible] service number. But we didn't have a bad quarter. We -- this whole business is steadily increasing. And Holistic Lithography altogether is probably the strongest growing business amongst all of our businesses.\nOperator: The next question comes from word.\nAnalysts: It's Addie from Bank America Merrill Lynch. I have 2 questions. Looking at the growth drivers in 2018, you're saying you're confident in memory has increased in the last quarter. Can you give us some color on how much you see your memory tool revenues increasing this year in 2018? And secondly, just a clarification on the EUV shipments. Clearly, the shipment numbers were very different, the revenue recognition numbers. How should we think about that as we go through the rest of the year?\nExecutives: I'll take the second one. You're right if you take Q2, we guided to almost EUR 600 million on 3 shipments. So we are planning to achieve a very important milestone where we basically can recognize their revenue at the point of shipment. We're confident that we'll achieve that, so that means we can recognize these 3 shipments right away when we ship them. But not only that. We can also recognize tools from Q1 and even Q4 that we had previously shipped. If you recall, Q1, we shipped 3 systems and we recognized only 1. So we basically have that catch-up order. And then from now on, you will see the revenue recognition at the time of shipment, so it's going to become more in sync. So you have that 1 catch-up order in Q2.\nExecutives: And on the growth drivers for 2018, is it is memory. Throughout the quarter, we've seen a steady increase of the -- or let's say a change in the demand trends from key memory customers. And try to analyze this, I think it is more focused on the DRAM situation. That's where we really saw from month to month, we saw an adjustment of the demand trends. As we said earlier, it's not so much the order pattern, it's more the 18-month forecast. And more importantly, the next 9 months that we have to agree with the customer taking into account our own lead time. And this is why we have seen this gradual increase in the end demand and making sense. I mean, if you look at the end markets, I mean, the DRAM obviously with DRAM pricing and look at the announced capacity additions over the last 3, 4 months, customers are reallocating memory types to free up space for the memories where they can make most money, which is in this case is DRAM. It all has happened over the last 3, 4 months, and that drives up the demand and variable to respond to that demand because we have reduced our cycle times. So that -- it's -- that's what it is. It's just the more clarity that we've given by customers and what they need this year.\nAnalysts: Okay. Understood. And just a quick follow-up, if I could. There is a lot of concern around this new article that recently came out around Apple not using EUV at TSMC. Do you have any thoughts around that? And finally, just the best Wolfgang. Hope just as exciting as it's been at ASML.\nExecutives: I'll let Wolfgang answer that one. Listen, I mean, we never comment on what customers say because this is always constantly customer A is going to supplier B and then switches back to A. There's many, many rumors in the space. What we focus on is what our customers are telling us and what they need and the orders that they place and their commitments that they want from us in terms of their tool demand. And that has not changed. Actually, this is why we have a very healthy backlog, and we took 9 EUV orders in Q2. But whatever is out there, it's going to be whatever it is in terms of rumors, but customers are committing [ hard euros ] to us to get tools. And that's what counts.\nExecutives: If you're able to get through this call and still have questions, please feel free to contact the ASML Investor Relations Department with your question. Now operator, maybe have the last caller, please?\nOperator: The last question will come from Ms. Tammy Qiu.\nAnalysts: Tammy Qiu from Berenberg. Can you talk briefly about what trend you are seeing at foundry and logic? Because from my understanding, apart from EUV momentum in the second half, foundry and logic should be stronger than your January expectation. Can you just talk us through what's the driver and what can be the early indication into beginning of 2019? And also, the second question is on multibeam tools. You said that in the presentation, you've already demonstrated the first [ 9-bin ] tool. And can you actually talk about what exactly can you bundle that tool with your new system so that you can have a high ASP with the existing system? Or are you going to sell that to as individual tool? And also, what's the potential number of bins you can bundle into a single machine? Because from my understanding, everyone in the industry has been working on a real tool for the past 2 decades, but no one has achieved anywhere close to commercialization.\nExecutives: Okay. Now the trends foundry and logic, like we said, we have a very detailed demand planning forecast process with our customers. I would agree with you that we see foundry logic being very strong. I don't feel that we currently looking at a significant uptick in that strong demand. I think it's been pretty well laid out. We feel pretty happy with this also in terms of business volume. So I think it's a bit too early for us to currently help you with an indication on accelerated growth in that area. I would love to do that, but I have to rely on our own process in our own process is going to be pretty healthy. But it's pretty stable. Now on the EUV, [ 9-beam ] is a prototype, so we've made -- we captured the first images. And as we showed in the presentation, the more beams that you have, the more service you can actually inspect in one go. So that means the whole focus is on maximizing the potential number of beams. And the -- since that is a productivity advantage, a significant one, that also means that the value out of the tool that will be higher than a single tool. So you could actually say that the value of the tool scales with the number of beams, and that will also -- it's too early to give you an indication of what that would mean. This discussed it with our customers first. But the potential number of beams where it, we're not disclosing anything yet. I mean, there are several companies working on their solutions. We'd like to keep it a little bit to our chest, but the 9 beams is just first prototype to show that multi-beam works, and we're working very hard to maximize that to the point where we have the highest value out of this type of solution. But I can tell you one thing. It's going to be significantly more than 9 beams.\nExecutives: All right. Before we sign off, I'd like to remind you that we'll be hosting an Investor Day here at our headquarters in Veldhoven on the afternoon of November 8. We hope you'll be able to join us. Now on behalf of ASML's board of management, I'd like to thank you all for joining us today. Operator, if you could formally conclude the call, I would appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the ASML 2018 First Quarter Financial Results Conference Call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the ASML 2018 First Quarter Financial Results Conference Call on April 18, 2018. [Operator Instructions] \nI would now like to turn the conference call over to Mr. Skip Miller. Go ahead, please, sir.\nExecutives: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. This is Skip Miller, Vice President, Investor Relations at ASML. Joining me today from ASML headquarters in Veldhoven, the Netherlands is ASML CEO, Peter Wennink; and CFO, Wolfgang Nickl. \nThe subject of today's call is ASML's 2018 first quarter results. Length of this call will be 60 minutes, and questions will be taken in the order that they were received. This call is also being broadcast live over the Internet at asml.com. A transcript of management's opening remarks and a replay of the call will be available on our website shortly following the conclusion of this call. \nBefore we begin, I'd like to caution listeners that comments made by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities law. These forward-looking statements involve material risks and uncertainties. For a discussion of risk factors, I encourage you to review the safe harbor statement contained in today's press release and presentation found on our website at asml.com and in ASML's annual report on Form 20-F and other documents as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. \nWith that, I would like to turn the call over to Peter Wennink for a brief introduction.\nExecutives: Thank you, Skip. Good morning and good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining us for our Q1 2018 results conference call. \nBefore we begin the question-and-answer session, Wolfgang and I would like to provide an overview and some commentary on the first quarter as well as provide our view of the coming quarters. Wolfgang will start with a review of our Q1 financial performance with added comments on our short-term outlook. I will complete the introduction with some additional comments, the current business environment and our future business outlook. \nWolfgang, if you will.\nExecutives: Thank you, Peter, and welcome, everyone. I will first highlight some of the first quarter accomplishments and then provide our guidance for the second quarter of 2018. \nQ1 net sales came in at EUR 2.29 billion, somewhat stronger than guided, driven by product mix and a strong DUV business. Net system sales of EUR 1.67 billion was primarily driven by strong memory revenue, which contributed 74% of sales. Logic, which now combined foundry and IDM sales, made up 26% of system sales. \nInstalled Base Management sales for the quarter came in at EUR 617 million, which was just above our guidance. Gross margin for the quarter came in at 48.7%, which was 70 basis points above the upper end of our guidance range, driven by both volume and mix. \nOverall OpEx came in slightly above guidance, with R&D expense at EUR 357 million and SG&A expenses at EUR 114 million. \nTurning to the balance sheet. We ended last quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at a level of EUR 3.19 billion. During the quarter, we purchased approximately EUR 170 million worth of shares. This means we still have EUR 2.33 billion of our 2018/2019 share buyback program remaining. \nMoving to the order book. Q1 system bookings came in at a strong EUR 2.44 billion. 57% of the order intake was from logic customers, driven by EUV. Memory made up the remaining 43% of our order volume, driven by Deep UV. We took 9 new EUV orders in the quarter. Additionally, we received 4 orders for High-NA R&D systems from 3 customers, and on top of this, we sold options for 8 High-NA early volume systems. \nHigh-NA is our next-generation EUV system, which will enable geometrical shrink beyond the next decade. The initial selling price for these High-NA systems is around EUR 270 million. We will receive 40% as a down payment, and the remaining 60% will be milestone based, with the majority of the milestone payments expected before shipment. The options were sold for EUR 50 million each, with payments starting this year. \nAt this point, I would like to comment on our reporting of bookings and backlog going forward. As we have communicated a number of times in the past, we establish our joint demand forecast with our customers, yes, very routine and comprehensive planning cycles. Order flow can be lumpy and therefore does not always reflect our business accurately. We believe reporting bookings and backlog provides limited value, and therefore, backlog will no longer be reported. If we want to provide some additional visibility during our initial EUV ramp phase, we will continue to report bookings throughout this year. We currently plan to no longer report bookings beginning in 2019. \nWith that, I would like to turn to our expectations and guidance for the second quarter of 2018. We expect Q2 total net sales between EUR 2.5 billion and EUR 2.6 billion. Our total net sales forecast includes almost EUR 600 million for our EUV business, while we target to ship 3 EUV systems in the quarter. Our Q2 EUV revenue forecast is a combination of revenue upon shipment and deferred revenue from prior quarters. This catch-up of deferred revenue was previously forecasted for the second half of the year. \nOn EUV revenue guidance, we have communicated that we will provide quarterly guidance until we are recognizing the majority of revenue for a system at the time of its shipment. We expect this to happen in Q2 and will therefore no longer provide quarterly EUV revenue guidance starting in 2019. \nFor the full year, our shipment plan have changed from 22 to 20 EUV systems. The change was due to a combination of anticipated end-of-year shipment logistic challenges due to multiple shipments in the fourth quarter as well as customer fab readiness. The 2 affected systems this year will ship early 2019 and will not impact customers' EUV production ramp plans. As a result of this adjustment, our EUV revenue for 2018 is now expected to be around EUR 2.1 billion versus EUR 2.3 billion that we had indicated previously. I would like to highlight, though, that we expect this reduction to be more than compensated by stronger DUV and applications businesses. We expect our Q2 Installed Base Management revenue to again come in around EUR 600 million. \nGross margin for the quarter is expected to be around 43%, impacted by the significant increase in EUV sales in the quarter. \nR&D expenses for Q2 will reflect continued accelerated investments in our portfolio and will come in at around EUR 375 million. SG&A is expected to come in at about EUR 115 million. \nWe have started a new share buyback program for 2018 and 2019 of up to EUR 2.5 billion. In Q1, EUR 170 million worth of shares were repurchased. Additionally, we have also proposed a 17% increase in our dividend to EUR 1.40 per share through our Annual Shareholder Meeting, which takes place on April 25 here in Veldhoven. The dividend payment is valued at around EUR 600 million. \nWe are excited about 2018. Customers' demand for our products continues to be strong, with strengthening demand in DUV as well as applications. In addition, we see strong demand for EUV as customers ramp this technology in production and have committed to this next-generation technology. We look forward to a year of continued strong growth in both revenue and profitability. \nWith that, I would like to turn the call back over to you, Peter.\nExecutives: Thank you, Wolfgang. I would like to start off by announcing a major milestone reached this quarter regarding our next-generation EUV technology of high numerical aperture or High-NA. We have aligned our development time line with customers, and we received orders for 4 High-NA R&D systems from 3 leading semiconductor manufacturers, targeted to start shipping in Q4 2021. We also sold to customers options to buy 8 early volume systems targeted to start shipping in 2024. Now this is a significant milestone in that it demonstrates customers' commitment to EUV technology for future nodes and provides great growth opportunity as we extend lithography technology beyond the next decade. \nI will highlight some of the key product features in more detail later, but I would like to first address our view of the business and the demand drivers. As Wolfgang highlighted, had a good start to the year, and our business continues to perform very well. The positive industry environment and increasing litho intensity as customers migrate to more advanced nodes continues to drive strong demand for our products in both logic and memory markets. \nAlthough this not -- this does not come as a surprise, we're increasingly optimistic about our 2018 outlook as compared to a quarter ago as we see strengthening demand in memory while logic demand remains solid. Based on expected growth and current guidance, we expect to see a significant increase in revenue in the second half of the year. And certainly stronger Deep UV will be primarily driven by memory, and stronger EUV will be primarily driven by logic. \nWe plan to ship to over 15 greenfield fabs in 2018. Maybe interesting to note that of these fabs, the majority will be in the China region, of which 7 are for domestic Chinese customers. \nMemory strength in both DRAM and NAND is driven by increasing content as well as expanding end market applications. In DRAM, our customers continue to migrate to the 1x nanometer node along with required wafer capacity additions to meet the increased bit demand. In NAND, a number of customers continue to ramp greenfield -- new greenfield fabs and scale vertically via stack-of-stacks, which requires additional lithography. \nWith strengthening demand in both DRAM and NAND, we see significant year-over-year growth. Based on current third-party estimates for both DRAM and NAND bit demand growth against our view of bit supply growth, we don't see major concerns regarding supply-demand balance throughout the year. \nLogic demand continues to be solid as customers ramp 10- and 7-nanometer nodes, while the initial demand for the latter, the 7-nanometer node, is the primary driver behind the significant increase in EUV demand in this year. \nOn the ASML product side, let me start with an update of our EUV business. In EUV, we continue to make progress as this technology starts to ramp in volume production. We delivered a configuration that achieved 125 wafers per hour at a customer site and continue to drive improvements in throughput performance, demonstrating 140 wafers per hour at ASML factories. We continue to focus on improving availability and work with our customers in support of infrastructure around EUV and volume production. \nDemand from our customers continues to be strong as they start ramping this technology in production. With the plan of 20 shipments in 2018, this represents a doubling of output over last year's shipments. As we now move into the volume phase of this new technology ramp, we will focus our operations and industrialization efforts on managing our supply chain and helping our customers with their fab readiness preparations. \nAs Wolfgang mentioned, we have shifted 2 systems to early 2019 due to a combination of customer fab readiness and anticipated challenges regarding the logistics around year-end shipments. However, based on our discussions with customers, our previously communicated estimates of their EUV layer adoption plans remain unchanged. As a reflection of their continued commitment to EUV production plans, we took orders for 9 NXE:3400 systems this quarter in support of our 2019 shipment plan of at least 30 systems. \nAs mentioned in my introduction, High-NA is our next-generation EUV technology, which extends lithography and enables cost-effective scaling beyond the next decade. The NA of the new optical system will increase from 0.33 on current EUV systems to 0.55 on High-NA systems. \nIn addition to new advanced optics driving improvements in imaging, platform innovations in stage technology will drive improvements in overlay and productivity. We're currently targeting an initial increase in productivity to 185 wafers per hour. Last year's investments in Carl Zeiss SMT will further solidify our development time line and reduces the execution risk. And with the addition of High-NA, ASML's product portfolio will include 0.33 NA, 0.55 NA \nEUV, dry and immersion Deep UV, i-Line as well as holistic products, all designed to work together seamlessly in production. \nIn Deep UV, we will increase our factory output to meet the market demand. Furthermore, our focus on productivity means we continue to boost our new system output, and we expect to exceed the record productivity level reached last year. \nIn addition to increasing the maximum configuration output per system, we are also continuously increasing productivity of our systems in the field. For instance, we achieved an output of 6,000 wafers per day on NXT systems in a NAND fab, which translates to a 5% increase in productivity over a 12-month period. With both increased system shipment output as well as productivity increases of systems in the fab, we are delivering further value to our customers via capacity and cost efficiency. \nIn Holistic Lithography, we continue to see growth across our full portfolio of software and metrology products. Our YieldStar metrology continues to gain broadening adoption, with recent growth via expansion in the memory market. We also shipped our first YieldStar 1375 system, which measures actual in-device lithography performance, enabling more accurate measurements of the device and thus driving yield improvements. We've shipped multiple pattern fidelity metrology tools, ePfm5, and are seeing initial positive customer results. This technology, where ASML's high-resolution e-beam technology is combined with our computational lithography software, will enable e-beam-based feedback to the scanner and deliver improved yield performance in volume production. \nTo further drive e-beam productivity performance and expand application opportunity in volume production, we are developing multi-beam technology. We successfully captured first images from our 3-by-3 beam proof-of-concept system. We see great growth opportunity in holistic litho business and expect its growth rate to exceed our overall revenue growth in the coming years. \nTo summarize, this year, we expect solid growth in both sales and profitability. We are more optimistic about our view of the year than we were a quarter ago due to the continued strengthening of memory demand while logic demand continues to be solid. We are on track to achieve our 2020 targets, with significant growth potential beyond 2020. We plan to communicate our growth opportunity beyond 2020 at our Investor Day on November 8 this year. \nAnd so last but not least, as many of you know, this quarterly call is the last call with Wolfgang online helping us to bring clarity to our results and operations. It goes without saying that at least with ASML, we'll miss him dearly, and we'd like to take the opportunity to thank him wholeheartedly for his invaluable contribution to ASML. Wish him all the best in his new challenge at Bayer, and we will follow him closely, he can rest assured. \nAnd with that, we will be happy to take your questions.\nExecutives: All right. Thank you, Wolfgang and Peter. Ladies and gentlemen, the operator will instruct you momentarily on the protocol for the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] Now operator, we have your final instructions and then the first question, please.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Mr. Farhan Ahmad.\nAnalysts: All right. Farhan Ahmad from Crédit Suisse. My first question is in regards to China on -- did I hear correctly that now you're seeing 7 domestic companies in China, whereas on the last call, you had mentioned 5? Can you just talk about what customer activity are you seeing in China? And how is it split between memory and logic foundry?\nExecutives: Yes. I think China is a rapidly developing market, but I have to tell you that these are -- like we said in the prepared remarks, these are greenfield fabs of different sizes but also 200-millimeter fabs. They are 200-millimeter initiatives. So it is -- basically expands across all segments. It's logic, DRAM, NAND, logic being foundry. There's DRAM initiatives. There is NAND initiatives. So it's the -- I would say, it's the entire breadth of the business that we're covering. And yes, it is moving, but we have to say these are greenfield fabs, which have a different pattern or an expected different pattern of ramping. Many of those fabs put in a first line to qualify the process, to qualify first product, which will take some time. So we have to be careful with -- although the number is significant, 7, we have to be a bit careful with the assessment of the speed with which they will ramp up, which will be a function of the successes that they have in qualifying process and product.\nAnalysts: Got it. And then one quick question on the sustainability of memory shipments that you have seen this year. On your comments, you talked about the sustainability. Can you talk about some of the analytics that you have done that give you confidence that the memory demand that you're seeing is sustainable? And also, if I look at your orders, the orders in memory had declined a lot. Is that an indication that the customers are being disciplined in how they are ordering, and even though the memory industry profitability is very high, they're kind of building to meet the supply -- the demand that they are seeing?\nExecutives: Yes. First, to talk about memory and the split between DRAM and NAND, the way that we calculate this is that of course, we don't know what the bit demand will be. So we focus -- basically, we use the available data from industry analysts, and we corroborate that with discussions that we have with customers and see how customers see this. I must admit that personally, I have sometimes the view that we're parroting after each other. We're all using the same percentages. There's not a lot of difference there. So this is on the bit demand side. Now what we know better is the bit supply side. We know pretty well how many tools are out there. We know pretty well how they are used in terms of availability and throughput. We pretty know -- we know pretty well what kind of technology is actually used, so we can calculate the bit supply pretty well as installed and as planned to be shipped. Now with DRAM, that's pretty accurate because we know this pretty well. With NAND, it's a bit of a caveat there as you have to make certain assumptions on the mix of layer stacks and the timing of when they increase layer stacks and, of course, some assumptions on the yields that they are having. Now you could argue that ASML might not be the most or the best-positioned company to have an insight in there, but we work with what we know and what we hear. So this is what we then use, basically applying the same methodologies with DRAM, taking how many systems do we have in the field, what's the productivity, what is our assumption on the mix of the layer stacks out there and so on, yield assumption. And that's how we come to this view that we currently have that supply and demand are pretty much in balance for this year, taking into account the caveats, which I think there are a little more caveats in there than there are in DRAM as far as our insights are concerned. On the order trends, well, actually, you're giving exactly the argument why we stop giving order guidance because it -- you can draw easily very strange conclusions for it. I mean, the way that we plan our shipments is an 18-months in-depth view with our customers on their expansion plans, on their capacity rollout plans and on their technology transitions. And orders come in from a very few customers in batches. So it doesn't say anything. When we give you guidance on what we believe the memory business is, it is based not on the order flow, it is based on the continued discussions we have with our customers on their ramp-up plans, their technology transitions. And that really drives our view of the business, not the order intake.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mr. Sandeep Deshpande.\nAnalysts: I have 2 questions. Firstly, for Wolfgang. I'm trying to understand the R&D guidance that you have given. The R&D guidance for Q2 is higher than the 2020, even if you took an absolute amount on your 2020 guidance, 13% of EUR 11 billion, on a quarterly basis, it is higher. Why it is higher? And is it going to sustainably remain higher? And secondly, if it is going to remain higher, why are you not capitalizing some of this R&D, given that, I mean, just what Peter said in his prepared remarks that some of these shipments on High-NA EUV are really going to happen in 2024, et cetera? So it's a very long way away as yet. And secondly, Peter, I have a question overall on the High-NA EUV business. Is the cost structure any different with -- in High-NA EUV given that Carl Zeiss is going to be such a important supplier there? I mean, clearly, it's an important supplier now and probably yet even more important supplier. And I'd like to thank you, Wolfgang, for all your support over the last few years while you were CFO of ASML.\nExecutives: Okay. Thanks, Sandeep. As it relates to R&D, we have taken the investments up. We're very heavily investing in High-NA, both here at ASML and through our High-NA agreement order size. But we are also investing heavily in Holistic Lithography in the guided beam and the multi-beam solutions. We do firmly keep our 13% of revenue envelope in mind, and we're not going to be quite there this year, but we're going to make progress year-over-year in terms of revenues that will keep that in front of us. As it relates to the capitalization, that's a function of the accounting rules. And as you know, when we talk to you, we talk based on our U.S. GAAP numbers. And there, you simply have to expense it. If you're interested in the capitalized version, you can always look at our IFRS numbers that we don't use internally in the management process where they get capitalized. Quite frankly, at the end of the day, it's all about cash flow. And there, you don't have a difference. So we manage ourselves based on the U.S. GAAP numbers, which we also, quite frankly, like because it's a bit more conservative.\nExecutives: Yes. On your second question on will there be a different cost structure on the High-NA EUV business, I think from a product cost, yes. I think from the start, there will be optics in there. Of course, it will be the EUV source there. But I think in terms of the cost buildup, it will be somewhat different. To start with the optics, I mean, I think we explained this before. We've taken an equity interest in Carl Zeiss, but also, we've agreed with them that we will co-fund their R&D as well as their CapEx. And the way that we get repaid on that funding is that we run this as a \"2 companies and one business\" kind of venture. So it means that we should both have -- and there's an equal internal rate of return. Only as you can imagine, if we put significantly more absolute euros in there than they do, then of course, somehow you need to get an absolute euro return, which is also significantly higher. And the way that we balance this or we compensate this is through the lens price. So it actually means that it's a pre-investment whereby you get a discount on the lens price to get a return on your investment. So that's one, and that's different than what we do today. And secondly, we use a -- we will use with High-NA the same source, the same EUV source, which is the source that we're currently using also for 0.33 NA. So all that, you could say a learning curve of that cost price of the current source will be captured by the time that we start shipping High-NA. I think those will be the 2 main drivers for a different cost structure in High-NA as compared to 0.33 NA, which should have a positive impact on the gross margin to start with.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mr. Hameed Awan.\nAnalysts: Yes. It's actually Alex Duval from Goldman Sachs. Just wanted to clarify very quickly what you said in terms of the High-NA orders and option sales. Can I just clarify that you said the average selling price is actually EUR 170 million for the original to sale? And therefore, how should we be thinking about the total amount of cash that you'll be getting from those initial 4 orders and when we get that?\nExecutives: Alex, so just to be clear, 2-7-0, that's EUR 270 million is the initial price of these tools. And the way how the arrangement has been done on the R&D tools is that we get 40% right away. And then there are 6 equal milestone-based payments that will happen for the next couple of years. And like I said in the prepared remark, we expect the majority of these payments will be in before the shipment actually happens. And then on top of that, we sold 8 options for early volume shipments, and they go with EUR 50, 5-0, million apiece, and those payments start this year. So it does exactly what we designed it for. We go through an accelerated development program to get this new technology in as soon as possible. And our customers help us with the cash flow because we talked about R&D, and we talked about our assistance in the ZEISS business. So I think those are the most important parameters around the cash flow.\nAnalysts: Helpful. And just as a very quick follow-up, you obviously talked about these very high ASPs for High-NA. But there will be new iteration to the current generation of EUV, as I understand it, before we get to High-NA in coming years. So could you help us understand, should there be price inflation on these EUV machines in the meantime? And how should we think about that in the next couple of years?\nExecutives: Well, we -- with that, we will do what we always do. I mean, when we provide more value to the customer, we actually look at what that means for them in terms of the litho cost per wafer or litho cost per transistor, how you want to calculate it. And in fact, we just split that value increase 50-50. We've always done that. We've done that since the inception of the company. And of course, value is very much driven by productivity. This is why productivity improvements in the current EUV and NA will happen over time, over the next couple of years. And that will drive also the value, which we're going to split with our customers.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mr. C.J. Muse.\nAnalysts: I guess, Peter, first question. You've got the longest-lead time equipment in the industry. So curious, as you think about announced and unannounced greenfield capacity as well as emerging spend out of China, could you talk about visibility and how you're thinking about 2019? I know it's only April, but would love to hear your thoughts.\nExecutives: You're talking about 2019 for the total business or it's for China?\nAnalysts: Sorry, the question was specific to your Deep UV business in aggregate as you take into account the visibility you have plus your longer lead times.\nExecutives: Yes. I think you have to -- I think it's way too early to go anything -- to start guiding on 2019. But just qualitatively, it's all driven by 2 things. It's technology transitions. I think technology transitions, 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer, they need significant amounts of Deep UV machines. The 7-nanometer node, as Mark Liu also mentioned, is in the minds of a lot of people. 10/7 is a big node. So -- but that -- the context of big, you need to see in the context of the end demand, yes? So I mean, what we're currently seeing in memory, for instance, is also a big use of our Deep UV systems, and it's driven by the demand out of the data centers. So it is really -- as a question, what you're asking is really the question about, will we -- do we believe that the end demand will stick? It's strong today. Will it stick in 2019? I think the general belief, and I'm quoting also customers, is that they believe that it actually will, that the technology transitions will indeed happen. So the Deep UV demand for 2019 will be strong. That's our -- that's what we currently feel, yes? Now like I said, the end markets are really driving the ultimate demand for capacity extensions. And of course, we don't have a crystal ball, you don't have it, and we just have to see how that will develop over the next couple of quarters.\nAnalysts: Sure, that's helpful. And I guess as my follow-up, on the EUV side, I guess 2 quick ones if I could sneak it in there. The first part is, how do we think about gross margins into the second half given the pull-in of some of the deferred revenues? And then given that you pushed 2 tools into 2019, should we infer that 32 could be the new number? Or is that just not reasonable?\nExecutives: Yes. On the gross margin, I think it's right to assume that we are steadily increasing the margin. I mean, we're not spelling it out anymore because of movements between quarters and also how the gross margin is done and how we sell to customers. But in general, that is indeed the case. And we've also talked about our EUV business. I mean, you have seen, in the first half, we were over EUR 150 million in first quarter, 600 in the -- almost EUR 600 million in the second quarter. It was EUR 2.1 billion for the year, so you see we have 2 heavy quarters coming. So you can clearly assume that the margin is going up.\nExecutives: Yes. On the shift of the 2 systems, yes, I mean, if you do -- if we said 30 before, 30 plus 2 is 32, I think I can do that math. But you have to realize that we're looking into 2019 where we really need to also understand the cutoff. At the end of 2019, I don't know exactly what we are going to have because we're not fully booked for 2019 yet. So I think, to be -- to stay on the safe side, I will just say we said we are planning for shipping our capacity of 30 units. I would, for the time being, stay at the 30 units.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mr. Mehdi Hosseini.\nAnalysts: Actually, Peter, just as a follow-up, 7-nanometer plus wasn't supposed to lead to any meaningful changes to the design as it relates to the EUV insertion. It has -- it had more to do with demand set. But 5-nanometer is going to have some implication or improvement especially with the layout. When do you expect your customers will be able to provide those design libraries with the EUV insertion that would enable design community to better understand the cost benefit of EUV?\nExecutives: Well, I think actually, that's pretty fastened and is already as a key attention for our customers. I mean, that's a question really to ask our customers, but I can give you some qualitative indication. I mean, when we talk to our customers, they actually are very happy with the progress that they're making on their 5-nanometer designs also using EUV. As what we said before, it reduces the complexity. So I think we got some very good feedback there. Although we, of course, don't know exactly where they are with their customers and how they present their designs and their libraries to their customers. But -- we don't know, but the sounds that we're getting out of the customer base are optimistic, and I think it's corroborated by what they say publicly. We listen to our major customers and what they say about EUV. I mean, it's pretty bullish. So -- and that's the only thing I can say, Mehdi. I mean, we get similar feedback from them as they are publicly stating.\nAnalysts: Sure. And just a quick follow-on on DRAM. Last call, you talked about trying to target a 2,000 wafer per day throughput as a milestone for getting your DRAM customers incrementally upbeat about adoption of EUV. Where are we with those targets? And any incremental color on the DRAM adoption of EUV? Especially as you -- as we go 1x to 1y, there's only 1- or 2-nanometer decline, and I'm not sure about the cost benefit. And is that impacting? And then any context of a throughput target? If you could provide any incremental color, it would be great.\nExecutives: Yes. I think we've always said, DRAM introduction will be for 1 or 2 layers, and it really depends on the specific customer's situation what they will go for. I think -- but you're right, I think the 2,000 wafer per day is kind of a generally accepted target in the DRAM space because of the lower cost that they can, of course, bear for their devices. I think 2,000 wafers per day is a function of the wafer per hour throughput, which we said we actually reached 125 and in -- at the customer's side and then 140 wafers per hour here at ASML. So that's good. And then it's a function of the availability, which is actually, we have a clear target of going over 90%. We're executing on that target with some good achievements made over the last quarter, especially on the collected degradation. We are getting the collected degradation and the consoles, so we are a little bit ahead of our target there. So then -- and we're rolling out several improvements -- availability improvement, as we speak, which actually mean that we have some major upgrades ongoing in the field. So if you would take average availability today, that is hampered also by the fact that we have to take tools down to do those upgrades. So -- but it -- but that all looks very much that we're on target to reach our over 90% availability when customers need it.\nAnalysts: But that incremental improvement isn't enough to get you excited about 2019 shipment?\nExecutives: That remains to be seen. I mean, like I said, 1 to 2 layers. Whether it's 1 or going to be 2 layers is up to the customers to this, and we're early in the -- in Q2 of 2018. I think customers will change their minds as they see performance going up in the course of this year. I think that's what they will do. So they'll very likely -- and I'm a bit assessing the situation that -- of course, they won't tell us everything in detail, but they will have plan A and plan B, which is a 1-layer application or a 2-layer application. So -- and that really depends on the progress that they will see throughout the year, and that will drive their implementation in 2019. But like I said, we're on our targets -- we're on our way to meet our targets for 2,000 wafers per day for the DRAM application. There are many availability solutions that we're currently rolling out into the field. So throughout the year, we'll know more.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mr. Andrew Gardiner.\nAnalysts: It's Andrew Gardiner from Barclays. I had another one on EUV, perhaps more on the demand side than sort of your capacity supply side. Peter, a couple of quarters ago, you had said that sort of the theoretical demand you were seeing from customers was sort of about 30% above the 30-tool capacity that you had for 2019. There's quite a few questions out there in the market about sort of levels of commitment, levels of layers. You just said that customers are confident and they're comfortable with the progress you guys are making. And so therefore, you haven't seen any change in that -- in your expectation of the layers. So is -- it's 2 quarters on from when you first heard that. Is the demand level for 2019 still at that kind of a level, so far outstripping the capacity today?\nExecutives: Yes. I think it is still over that capacity number. It is changing from time to time, up or down, because of the timing that our customers are currently looking at for their ramp because it is not only whether you use 6 or you use 10 layers, but it's also what is the wafer capacity that you are going to build. So I think it is -- there is some changes back and forth, up and down, which is driven more by how much wafer capacity do they want to build. That has less to do with the technology but more with the end demand. And that is still above our capacity -- build capacity.\nAnalysts: Okay. I suppose to put it another way, then sort of from a logic point of view, the 10 layers or more, you still stick to that sort of the layer count expectation?\nExecutives: Yes, but that is a method of how big is the end market. So it's also a way, a method of how quickly do they want to ramp to a certain first phase of that node, yes? So that is also, of course, determining whether how much the end demand will be over our capacity.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mr. Pierre Ferragu.\nAnalysts: It's Pierre Ferragu from New Street Research. I'd just like to get back, Peter, on what you said about the memory markets where you listed where you have, like, very good insight in how capacity is building up and that you see it's meeting very well the capacity demand. My question is, it seems that it's costing way more in terms of what you said roughly today than it was a few years ago because your revenues from memory are very significant. So could you explain us, maybe is there an easy way to explain us why in order to increase its capacity, the industry needs to spend more today than it was maybe a few years ago? Is that because shrink is delivering less bit growth and then it rings for more capacity? And is that something you see as a new normal, as something that will be sustainable over time?\nExecutives: Well, it is clear that they are spending more now than they did a few years ago in terms of litho tools. It doesn't mean that your cost per bit goes up, no, because you're actually shrinking. So the cost per bit, even if you spend more on litho and on equipment, as -- I don't need to explain it to you. But then your cost per bit still goes up, and then that still goes down. But what we're currently seeing, and I think that's kind of -- it's been a long time that we've seen memory prices, especially DRAM prices, staying very strong and even growing, while you could argue the cost of manufacturing goes up. That tells you something. I mean, we've always said memory is a commodity, and a commodity has a high-price elasticity. Well, the price elasticity when prices go up doesn't mean that the demand goes down. No, it's just the opposite. I think the demand is extremely high, and that means that even customers and end customers are willing to pay the high prices. So for our memory customers, it's -- that's an easy choice you have in that market that wants your product more than you can deliver, which actually means you buy the capacity, which may be at higher wafer cost, but your margins are significantly higher because of the market situation. So it is just business. They will buy what they need if the end market is there. And what you will see, if the end market is not there, they will buy less, and they will just squeeze everything out of the current installed base. So I don't see the issue, yes? And I don't think customers see issues because they see the end markets, they see their product margins, they see the opportunities. We don't see, and certainly not in the DRAM space, an exaggerated buildup of supply. So they buy what they need, and it costs a bit more, but they also earn more.\nAnalysts: Okay, that's very clear. So it costs a bit, still it comes down, but it just, over time, gets translated into more spending in lithography. And then maybe more specifically on NAND, you mentioned like plans, you started adding to their stack on 3D NAND, increasing the number of layers. Do you have an early insight on whether stacking up NAND like that is delivering on its promise in terms of where you're seeing the cost per bit. Do you have visibility on that already?\nExecutives: Well, the cost per bit, when you stack and you use historical yield assumptions for this type of device, then it's clear, the cost per bit goes down, yes? So now from a lithography point of view, it is also clear to us there will be stacks-of-stacks. I mean, that's what every customer confirms. Now the big question is, after how many stacks do you need another? Well, after how many layers do you need another stack? That might be different customer per customer. But that's a thing that is certain to us. So yes, cost per bit will go down with vertical scaling. But like I said earlier, the ultimate cost is also a function of a couple of things. And one of them, a very important thing is, of course, yield. When yields go up, cost per bit goes down. It's that simple.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mr. Dave Mulholland.\nAnalysts: It's David Mulholland from UBS. Just quickly on the -- you made a comment earlier to say you're still increasing your DUV capacity. And I guess over the next year or 2, as you start to ramp up EUV in volume more significantly, there's general expectation DUV will go into decline. So I'm just wondering if you can help us understand how you think about your DUV business over the next couple of years and why increase capacity now in that context.\nExecutives: I think when we say we increase capacity, don't think about adding square meters, building factories and putting tooling in. I mean, it's really, yes, you get a bit more people in because you just work somewhat longer hours. But the most important part is operational efficiency. So you're reducing cycle time in the factory and basically getting more machines out using -- at the same fixed cost. That's how you do it.\nAnalysts: Okay. So it's not to say that you suddenly got a more optimistic view on player information on a 2-, 3-year view?\nExecutives: No, no. I think we are increasing capacity because the customer demand is there. And like I said, you can do this in a couple of ways: by taking the long route, and that's basically building a factory and hiring people and don't change your processes; or you can drive down cycle times and just get more out of the same square meters. And that's what we're doing today. And it's cheaper.\nAnalysts: That's clear. And then just coming back on the EUV High-NA discussion, you've made a few comments on value and pricing. But just obviously, there's been quite a challenging ramp from a gross margin perspective as the initial ramp of EUVs come in. Do you expect that we'll see a similar challenge as we start to introduce High-NA, start low and then increase? Or will it be starting from a much better starting point given what you've already learned on EUV as we transition to High-NA?\nExecutives: Yes. We'll start from a much better starting point. You will always see that the first tools have a lower gross margin than the tools when you're in volume because you have the learning curve and the warranty that goes with that, which is always higher with the first tools. But like I said earlier, we have this agreement on our return on investment of the R&D and the CapEx we do with Carl Zeiss, which will translate into a reduction, a discount on the optics, which is the most expensive part of the entire tool. And the EUV source is the same source as we use in 0.33. So that learning curve will have kicked in by the time that we start shipping the High-NA tools.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mr. Douglas Smith.\nAnalysts: It's Doug Smith from Agency Partners. I saw that the wafer throughput for High-NA was actually higher than for low NA at 185 wafers per hour. Does that mean that the 2, low NA and High-NA, won't coexist, that High-NA will just take over eventually?\nExecutives: That's a good question. I mean, it used to be the case that when you introduce a new technology, that you see a cannibalization of the previous one, which will not be the case for High-NA EUV. High-NA EUV will be used for the absolute critical layers. It will be an expensive tool, EUR 268 million, but it will provide not only more productivity but also the geometrical shrink, as Wolfgang mentioned. So it means, for those layers where you need the shrink, you will apply the High-NA tool. For those layers where you don't need that shrink capability of a High-NA tool, you will use the 0.33 tool. So it's going be a mix and match. Everything that we're currently seeing and discussing with customers is going to be mix and match of 0.33 and the 0.55 NA tool. So that means that the 0.33 EUV tool will have a very long life.\nAnalysts: Okay, it's very clear. And one quick question. The metrology and inspection business looked like it had a pretty small quarter. Are there some issues going on in that business?\nExecutives: Oh, it was -- I don't know how you come to that conclusion. We had -- of course, the whole business is within our systems number, and a part of it is within our service number. But we didn't have a bad quarter. We -- this whole business is steadily increasing. And Holistic Lithography altogether is probably the strongest-growing business amongst all of our businesses.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mr. Adithya Metuku.\nAnalysts: It's Adi from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. So I have 2 questions. Firstly, looking at the growth drivers in 2018, you're saying you're confident that memory has increased in the last quarter. Can you give us some color on how much you see your memory tool revenues increasing this year in 2018? And secondly, just a clarification on the EUV shipments. Clearly, the shipment numbers were very different to the revenue recognition numbers. So how should we think about that as we go through the rest of the year?\nExecutives: I'll take the second one. You're right, if you take Q2, we guided to almost EUR 600 million on 3 shipments. So we are planning to achieve a very important milestone where we basically can recognize revenue at the point of shipment. We're confident that we'll achieve that, so that means we can recognize these 3 shipments right away when we ship them. But not only that. We can also recognize tools from Q1 and even Q4 that we had previously shipped. If you recall, Q1, we shipped 3 systems, and we recognized only one. So we basically have that catch-up order. And then from now on, you will see the revenue recognition at the time of shipment, so it's going to be much more in sync. But you have that one catch-up order in Q2.\nExecutives: Yes. And on the growth drivers for 2018, yes, it is memory. We've -- throughout the quarter, we've seen there's a steady increase of the -- or let's say a change in the demand plans from key memory customers. And when I try to analyze this, I think it is more focused on the DRAM situation. That's where we really saw -- from month to month, we saw an adjustment of the demand plans. And as we said earlier, it's not so much the order pattern, it's more the 18-month forecast, and more importantly, the next 9 months that we have to agree with the customer, taking into account our own lead time. And this is where we have seen this gradual increase in the end demand and making sense. I mean, if you look at the end markets, I mean, the DRAM obviously with the DRAM pricing, and look at the announced capacity additions over the last 3, 4 months, customers are reallocating memory types to free up space for memories where they can make most money, which in this case is DRAM. And all that's happened over the last 3, 4 months, and that drives up the demand. And we're able to respond to that demand because we have reduced our cycle times. So that -- it's -- that's what it is. So it's just the more clarity that we've been given by our customers on what they need this year.\nAnalysts: Okay, understood. And just a quick follow-up if I could. There is a lot of concern around this news article that recently came out around Apple not using EUV at TSMC. Do you have any thoughts around that? And finally, just all the best to Wolfgang. I hope your time at Bayer is just as exciting as it's been at ASML.\nExecutives: I'll let Wolfgang answer that last one. Just listen, I mean, we never comment on what customers of customers say because, yes, this is always -- we hear this constantly, customer A is going to supplier B and then switches back to A. There's many, many rumors in this space. What we focus on is what our customers are telling us on what they need and the orders that they place and the commitments that they want from us in terms of their tool demand. And that has not changed actually. And this is why we have a very healthy backlog, and we took 9 EUV orders in Q2. So whatever is out there is going to beat whatever it is in terms of rumors, but customers are committing hard euros to us to get tools. And that's what counts.\nExecutives: All right. Ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one last question. If you aren't able to get through on this call and still have questions, please feel free to contact the ASML Investor Relations Department with your question.\nOperator: The last question will come from Ms. Tammy Qiu.\nAnalysts: Tammy Qiu from Berenberg. Firstly, can you talk briefly about what trend you are seeing at foundry and logic? Because from my understanding, apart from EUV momentum in the second half, foundry and logic should be stronger than your January expectation. Can you just talk us through what's the driver and what can be the early indication into beginning of 2019? And also, the second question is on multi-beam tools. You said that in the presentation, you already demonstrated the first 9-beam tool. And can you actually talk about what exactly can you bundle that tool with your new system so that you can have a high ASP with the existing system? Or are you going to sell that, too, as individual tool? And also, what's the potential number of beams you can bundle into the single machine? Because from my understanding, everyone in the industry has been working on a real multi-beam tool for the past 2 decades, but no one has achieved anywhere close to commercialization.\nExecutives: Okay. Now the trends foundry and logic, like we said, we have a very detailed demand planning forecast process with our customers. I would agree with you that we see foundry and logic being very strong. I don't feel that we're currently looking at a significant uptick in that strong demand. I think it's been pretty well laid out. We feel pretty happy with this also in terms of business volume. So I think it's a bit too early to -- for us to currently help you with any indication on accelerated growth in that area. I would love to do that, but I have to rely on our own process, and our own process says it's going to be pretty healthy, that it's pretty stable. Now on the e-beam, yes, 9-beam is a prototype, so we've made the -- we captured the first images. And as we showed also in the presentation, the more beams that you have, the more servers you can actually inspect in one go. So that means the whole focus is on maximizing the potential number of beams. And the -- since that is a productivity advantage, a significant one, that also means that the value out of a tool like that will be higher than a single tool. So you could actually say that the value of the tool scales with the number of beams. And that will also -- it's too early to give you an indication of what that would mean. We've discussed it with our customers first. But the potential number of beams, we're not disclosing anything yet. I mean, there are several companies working on their solutions. We'd like to keep it a little bit to our chest, but the 9 beams is just first prototype to show that multi-beam works, and we're very hard to -- we're working very hard to maximize that to the point where we have the highest value out of this type of solution. But I can tell you one thing: it's going to be significantly more than 9 beams.\nExecutives: All right. Before we sign off, I'd like to remind you that we'll be hosting an Investor Day here at our headquarters in Veldhoven on the afternoon, November 8. We hope you'll be able to join us. \nNow on behalf of ASML's board and management, I'd like to thank you all for joining us today. Operator, if you could formally conclude the call, I would appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the ASML 2018 First Quarter Financial Results Conference Call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the ASML 2018 First Quarter Financial Results Conference Call on April 18, 2018. [Operator Instructions] \nI would now like to turn the conference call over to Skip Miller. Go ahead, please, sir.\nExecutives: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. This is Skip Miller, Vice President, Investor Relations at ASML. Joining me today from ASML headquarters in Veldhoven, The Netherlands is ASML CEO, Peter Wennink; and CFO, Wolfgang Nickl. \nThe subject of today's call is ASML's 2018 first quarter results. Length of this call will be 60 minutes, and questions will be taken in the order that they were received. This call is also being broadcast live over the Internet at asml.com. A transcript of management's opening remarks and a replay of the call will be available on our website shortly following the conclusion of this call. \nBefore we begin, I'd like to caution listeners that comments made by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities law. These forward-looking statements involve material risks and uncertainties. For a discussion of risk factors, I encourage you to review the safe harbor statement contained in today's press release and presentation found on our website at asml.com and in ASML's annual report on Form 20-F and other documents as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. \nWith that, I would like to turn the call over to Peter Wennink for a brief introduction.\nExecutives: Thank you, Skip. Good morning and good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining us for our Q1 2018 results conference call. \nBefore we begin the question-and-answer session, Wolfgang and I would like to provide an overview and some commentary on the first quarter as well as provide our view of the coming quarters. Wolfgang will start with a review of our Q1 financial performance with added comments on our short-term outlook. I will complete the introduction with some additional comments, the current business environment and our future business outlook. \nWolfgang, if you will.\nExecutives: Thank you, Peter, and welcome, everyone. I will first highlight some of the first quarter accomplishments and then provide our guidance for the second quarter of 2018. \nQ1 net sales came in at EUR 2.29 billion, somewhat stronger than guided, driven by product mix and a strong DUV business. Net system sales of EUR 1.67 billion was primarily driven by strong memory revenue, which contributed 74% of sales. Logic, which now combines foundry and IDM sales, made up 26% of system sales. \nInstalled Base Management sales for the quarter came in at EUR 617 million, which was just above our guidance. Gross margin for the quarter came in at 48.7%, which was 70 basis points above the upper end of our guidance range, driven by both volume and mix. \nOverall OpEx came in slightly above guidance, with R&D expense at EUR 357 million and SG&A expenses at EUR 114 million. \nTurning to the balance sheet. We ended last quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at a level of EUR 3.19 billion. During the quarter, we purchased approximately EUR 170 million worth of shares. This means we still have EUR 2.33 billion of our 2018/2019 share buyback program remaining. \nMoving to the order book. Q1 system bookings came in at a strong EUR 2.44 billion. 57% of the order intake was from logic customers, driven by EUV. Memory made up the remaining 43% of our order volume, driven by Deep UV. We took 9 new EUV orders in the quarter. Additionally, we received 4 orders for High-NA R&D systems from 3 customers, and on top of this, we sold options for 8 High-NA early volume systems. \nHigh-NA is our next-generation EUV system, which will enable geometrical shrink beyond the next decade. The initial selling price for these High-NA systems is around EUR 270 million. We will receive 40% as a down payment, and the remaining 60% will be milestone based, with the majority of the milestone payments expected before shipment. The options were sold for EUR 50 million each, with payments starting this year. \nAt this point, I would like to comment on our reporting of bookings and backlog going forward. As we have communicated a number of times in the past, we establish our joint demand forecast with our customers, they are very routine and comprehensive planning cycles. Order flow can be lumpy and therefore does not always reflect our business accurately. We believe reporting bookings and backlog provides limited value, and therefore, backlog will no longer be reported. If we want to provide some additional visibility during our initial EUV ramp phase, we will continue to report bookings throughout this year. We currently plan to no longer report bookings beginning in 2019. \nWith that, I would like to turn to our expectations and guidance for the second quarter of 2018. We expect Q2 total net sales between EUR 2.5 billion and EUR 2.6 billion. Our total net sales forecast includes almost EUR 600 million for our EUV business, while we target to ship 3 EUV systems in the quarter. Our Q2 EUV revenue forecast is a combination of revenue upon shipment and deferred revenue from prior quarters. This catch-up of deferred revenue was previously forecasted for the second half of the year. \nOn EUV revenue guidance, we have communicated that we will provide quarterly guidance until we are recognizing the majority of revenue for a system at the time of its shipment. We expect this to happen in Q2 and will therefore no longer provide quarterly EUV revenue guidance starting in 2019. \nFor the full year, our shipment plan has changed from 22 to 20 EUV systems. The change was due to a combination of anticipated end-of-year shipment logistic challenges due to multiple shipments in the fourth quarter as well as customer fab readiness. The 2 affected systems this year will ship early 2019 and will not impact customers' EUV production ramp plans. As a result of this adjustment, our EUV revenue for 2018 is now expected to be around EUR 2.1 billion versus EUR 2.3 billion that we had indicated previously. I would like to highlight, though, that we expect this reduction to be more than compensated by stronger DUV and applications businesses. We expect our Q2 Installed Base Management revenue to again come in around EUR 600 million. \nGross margin for the quarter is expected to be around 43%, impacted by the significant increase in EUV sales in the quarter. \nR&D expenses for Q2 will reflect continued accelerated investments in our portfolio and will come in at around EUR 375 million. SG&A is expected to come in at about EUR 115 million. \nWe have started a new share buyback program for 2018 and 2019 of up to EUR 2.5 billion. In Q1, EUR 170 million worth of shares were repurchased. Additionally, we have also proposed a 17% increase in our dividend to EUR 1.40 per share through our Annual Shareholder Meeting, which takes place on April 25 here in Veldhoven. The dividend payment is valued at around EUR 600 million. \nWe are excited about 2018. Customers' demand for our products continues to be strong, with strengthening demand in DUV as well as applications. In addition, we see strong demand for EUV as customers ramp this technology in production and have committed to this next-generation technology. We look forward to a year of continued strong growth in both revenue and profitability. \nWith that, I would like to turn the call back over to you, Peter.\nExecutives: Thank you, Wolfgang. I would like to start off by announcing a major milestone reached this quarter regarding our next-generation EUV technology of high numerical aperture or High-NA. We have aligned our development time line with customers, and we received orders for 4 High-NA R&D systems from 3 leading semiconductor manufacturers, targeted to start shipping in Q4 2021. We also sold to customers options to buy 8 early volume systems targeted to start shipping in 2024. Now this is a significant milestone in that it demonstrates customers' commitment to EUV technology for future nodes and provides great growth opportunity as we extend lithography technology beyond the next decade. \nI will highlight some of the key product features in more detail later, but I would like to first address our view of the business and the demand drivers. As Wolfgang highlighted, had a good start to the year, and our business continues to perform very well. The positive industry environment and increasing litho intensity as customers migrate to more advanced nodes continues to drive strong demand for our products in both logic and memory markets. \nAlthough this not -- this does not come as a surprise, we're increasingly optimistic about our 2018 outlook as compared to a quarter ago as we see strengthening demand in memory while logic demand remains solid. Based on expected growth and current guidance, we expect to see a significant increase in revenue in the second half of the year. And in [ some ways ] stronger Deep UV will be primarily driven by memory, and stronger EUV will be primarily driven by logic. \nWe plan to ship to over 15 greenfield fabs in 2018. It may be interesting to note that of these fabs, the majority will be in the China region, of which 7 are for domestic Chinese customers. \nMemory strength in both DRAM and NAND is driven by increasing content as well as expanding end market applications. In DRAM, our customers continue to migrate to the 1x nanometer node along with required wafer capacity additions to meet the increased bit demand. In NAND, a number of customers continue to ramp greenfield -- new greenfield fabs and scale vertically via stack-of-stacks, which requires additional lithography. \nWith strengthening demand in both DRAM and NAND, we see significant year-over-year growth. Based on current third-party estimates for both DRAM and NAND bit demand growth against our view of bit supply growth, we don't see major concerns regarding supply-demand balance throughout the year. \nLogic demand continues to be solid as customers ramp 10- and 7-nanometer nodes, while the initial demand for the latter, the 7-nanometer node, is the primary driver behind the significant increase in EUV demand in this year. \nOn the ASML product side, let me start with an update of our EUV business. In EUV, we continue to make progress as this technology starts to ramp in volume production. We delivered a configuration that achieved 125 wafers per hour at a customer site and continue to drive improvements in throughput performance, demonstrating 140 wafers per hour at ASML factories. We continue to focus on improving availability and work with our customers in support of infrastructure around EUV and volume production. \nDemand from our customers continues to be strong as they start ramping this technology in production. With a plan of 20 shipments in 2018, this represents a doubling of output over last year's shipments. As we now move into the volume phase of this new technology ramp, we will focus our operations and industrialization efforts on managing our supply chain and helping our customers with their fab readiness preparations. \nAs Wolfgang mentioned, we have shifted 2 systems to early 2019 due to a combination of customer fab readiness and anticipated challenges regarding the logistics around year-end shipments. However, based on our discussions with customers, our previously communicated estimates of their EUV layer adoption plans remain unchanged. As a reflection of their continued commitment to EUV production plans, we took orders for 9 NXE:3400 systems this quarter in support of our 2019 shipment plan of at least 30 systems. \nAs mentioned in my introduction, High-NA is our next-generation EUV technology, which extends lithography and enables cost-effective scaling beyond the next decade. The NA of the new optical system will increase from 0.33 on current EUV systems to 0.55 on High-NA systems. \nIn addition to new advanced optics driving improvements in imaging, platform innovations in stage technology will drive improvements in overlay and productivity. We're currently targeting an initial increase in productivity to 185 wafers per hour. Last year's investments in Carl Zeiss SMT will further solidify our development time line and reduces the execution risk. And with the addition of High-NA, ASML's product portfolio will include 0.33 NA, 0.55 NA \nEUV, dry and immersion Deep UV, i-Line as well as holistic products, all designed to work together seamlessly in production. \nIn Deep UV, we will increase our factory output to meet the market demand. Furthermore, our focus on productivity means we continue to boost our new system output, and we expect to exceed the record productivity level reached last year. \nIn addition to increasing the maximum configuration output per system, we are also continuously increasing productivity of our systems in the field. For instance, we achieved an output of 6,000 wafers per day on NXT systems in a NAND fab, which translates to a 5% increase in productivity over a 12-month period. With both increased system shipment output as well as productivity increases of systems in the fab, we are delivering further value to our customers via capacity and cost efficiency. \nIn Holistic Lithography, we continue to see growth across our full portfolio of software and metrology products. Our YieldStar metrology continues to gain broadening adoption, with recent growth via expansion in the memory market. We also shipped our first YieldStar 1375 system, which measures actual in-device lithography performance, enabling more accurate measurements of the device and thus driving yield improvements. We've shipped multiple pattern fidelity metrology tools, ePfm5, and are seeing initial positive customer results. This technology, where ASML's high-resolution e-beam technology is combined with our computational lithography software, will enable e-beam-based feedback to the scanner and deliver improved yield performance in volume production. \nTo further drive e-beam productivity performance and expand application opportunity in volume production, we are developing multi-beam technology. We successfully captured first images from our 3-by-3 beam proof-of-concept system. We see great growth opportunity in holistic litho business and expect its growth rate to exceed our overall revenue growth in the coming years. \nTo summarize, this year, we expect solid growth in both sales and profitability. We are more optimistic about our view of the year than we were a quarter ago due to the continued strengthening of memory demand while logic demand continues to be solid. We are on track to achieve our 2020 targets, with significant growth potential beyond 2020. We plan to communicate our growth opportunity beyond 2020 at our Investor Day on November 8 this year. \nAnd so last but not least, as many of you know, this quarterly call is the last call with Wolfgang online helping us to bring clarity to our results and operations. It goes without saying that at least with ASML, we'll miss him dearly, and we'd like to take the opportunity to thank him wholeheartedly for his invaluable contribution to ASML. Wish him all the best in his new challenge at Bayer, and we will follow him closely, you can rest assured. \nAnd with that, we will be happy to take your questions.\nExecutives: All right. Thank you, Wolfgang and Peter. Ladies and gentlemen, the operator will instruct you momentarily on the protocol for the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] Now operator, we have your final instructions and then the first question, please.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Mr. Farhan Ahmad.\nAnalysts: All right. Farhan Ahmad from Crédit Suisse. My first question is in regards to China on -- did I hear correctly that now you're seeing 7 domestic companies in China, whereas on the last call, you had mentioned 5? Can you just talk about what customer activity are you seeing in China? And how is it split between memory and logic foundry?\nExecutives: Yes. I think China is a rapidly developing market, but I have to tell you that these are -- like we said in the prepared remarks, these are greenfield fabs of different sizes but also 200-millimeter fabs. They are 200-millimeter initiatives. So it is -- basically expands across all segments. It's logic, DRAM, NAND, logic being foundry. There's DRAM initiatives. There is NAND initiatives. So it's the -- I would say, it's the entire breadth of the business that we're covering. And yes, it is moving, but we have to say these are greenfield fabs, which have a different pattern or an expected different pattern of ramping. Many of those fabs put in a first line to qualify the process, to qualify first product, which will take some time. So we have to be careful with -- although the number is significant, 7, we have to be a bit careful with the assessment of the speed with which they will ramp up, which will be a function of the successes that they have in qualifying process and product.\nAnalysts: Got it. And then one quick question on the sustainability of memory shipments that you have seen this year. On your comments, you talked about the sustainability. Can you talk about some of the analytics that you have done that give you confidence that the memory demand that you're seeing is sustainable? And also, if I look at your orders, the orders in memory had declined a lot. Is that an indication that the customers are being disciplined in how they are ordering, and even though the memory industry profitability is very high, they're kind of building to meet the supply -- the demand that they are seeing?\nExecutives: Yes. First, to talk about memory you have to split between DRAM and NAND, the way that we calculate this is that of course, we don't know what the bit demand will be. So we focus -- basically, we use the available data from industry analysts, and we corroborate that with discussions that we have with customers and see how customers see this. I must admit that personally, I have sometimes the view that we're parroting after each other. We're all using the same percentages. There's not a lot of difference there. So this is on the bit demand side. Now what we know better is the bit supply side. We know pretty well how many tools are out there. We know pretty well how they are used in terms of availability and throughput. We pretty know -- we know pretty well what kind of technology is actually used, so we can calculate the bit supply pretty well as installed and as planned to be shipped. Now with DRAM, that's pretty accurate because we know this pretty well. With NAND, it's a bit of a caveat there as you have to make certain assumptions on the mix of layer stacks and the timing of when they increase layer stacks and, of course, some assumptions on the yields that they are having. Now you could argue that ASML might not be the most or the best-positioned company to have an insight in there, but we work with what we know and what we hear. So this is what we then use, basically applying the same methodologies with DRAM, taking how many systems do we have in the field, what's the productivity, what is our assumption on the mix of the layer stacks out there and so on, yield assumption. And that's how we come to this view that we currently have that supply and demand are pretty much in balance for this year, taking into account the caveats, which I think there are a little more caveats in there than there are in DRAM as far as our insights are concerned. On the order trends, well, actually, you're giving exactly the argument why we stop giving order guidance because it -- you can draw easily very strange conclusions for it. I mean, the way that we plan our shipments is an 18-months in-depth view with our customers on their expansion plans, on their capacity rollout plans and on technology transitions. And orders come in from a very few customers in batches. So it doesn't say anything. When we give you guidance on what we believe the memory business is, it is based not on the order flow, it is based on the continued discussions we have with our customers on their ramp-up plans, their technology transitions. And that really drives our view of the business, not the order intake.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mr. Sandeep Deshpande.\nAnalysts: I have 2 questions. Firstly, for Wolfgang. I'm trying to understand the R&D guidance that you have given. The R&D guidance for Q2 is higher than the 2020, even if you took an absolute amount on your 2020 guidance, 13% of EUR 11 billion, on a quarterly basis, it is higher. Why it is higher? And is it going to sustainably remain higher? And secondly, if it is going to remain higher, why are you not capitalizing some of this R&D, given that, I mean, just what Peter said in his prepared remarks that some of these shipments on High-NA EUV are really going to happen in 2024, et cetera? So it's a very long way away as yet. And secondly, Peter, I have a question overall on the High-NA EUV business. Is the cost structure any different with -- in High-NA EUV given that Carl Zeiss is going to be such a important supplier there? I mean, clearly, it's an important supplier now and probably yet even more important supplier. And I'd like to thank you, Wolfgang, for all your support over the last few years while you were CFO of ASML.\nExecutives: Okay. Thanks, Sandeep. As it relates to R&D, we have taken the investments up. We're very heavily investing in High-NA, both here at ASML and through our High-NA agreement order size. But we are also investing heavily in Holistic Lithography in the guided beam and the multi-beam solutions. We do firmly keep our 13% of revenue envelope in mind, and we're not going to be quite there this year, but we're going to make progress year-over-year in terms of a percent of revenues that will keep that in front of us. As it relates to the capitalization, that's a function of the accounting rules. And as you know, when we talk to you, we talk based on our U.S. GAAP numbers. And there, you simply have to expense it. If you're interested in the capitalized version, you can always look at our IFRS numbers that we don't use internally in the management process where they get capitalized. Quite frankly, at the end of the day, it's all about cash flow. And there, you don't have a difference. So we manage ourselves based on the U.S. GAAP numbers, which we also, quite frankly, like because it's a bit more conservative.\nExecutives: Yes. On your second question on will there be a different cost structure on the High-NA EUV business, I think from a product cost, yes. I think [ from the start ], there will be optics in there. Of course, it will be the EUV source there. But I think in terms of the cost buildup, it will be somewhat different. To start with the optics, I mean, I think we explained this before. We've taken an equity interest in Carl Zeiss, but also, we've agreed with them that we will co-fund their R&D as well as their CapEx. And the way that we get repaid on that funding is that we run this as a \"2 companies and one business\" kind of venture. So it means that we should both have -- and there's an equal internal rate of return. Only as you can imagine, if we put significantly more absolute euros in there than they do, then of course, somehow you need to get an absolute euro return, which is also significantly higher. And the way that we balance this or we compensate this is through the lens price. So it actually means that it's a pre-investment whereby you get a discount on the lens price to get a return on your investment. So that's one, and that's different than what we do today. And secondly, we use a -- we will use with High-NA the same source, the same EUV source, which is the source that we're currently using also for 0.33 NA. So all that, you could say a learning curve of that cost price of the current source will be captured by the time that we start shipping High-NA. I think those will be the 2 main drivers for a different cost structure in High-NA as compared to 0.33 NA, which should have a positive impact on the gross margin to start with.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mr. Hameed Awan.\nAnalysts: Yes. It's actually Alex Duval from Goldman Sachs. Just wanted to clarify very quickly what you said in terms of the High-NA orders and option sales. Can I just clarify that you said the average selling price is actually EUR 170 million for the original tool sale? And therefore, how should we be thinking about the total amount of cash that you'll be getting from those initial 4 orders and when we get that?\nExecutives: Alex, so just to be clear, 2-7-0, that's EUR 270 million is the initial price of this tool. And the way how the arrangement has been done on the R&D tools is that we get 40% right away. And then there are 6 equal milestone-based payments that will happen for the next couple of years. And like I said in the prepared remark, we expect the majority of these payments will be in before the shipment actually happens. And then on top of that, we sold 8 options for early volume shipments, and they go at EUR 50, 5-0, million apiece, and those payments start this year. So it does exactly what we designed it for. We go through an accelerated development program to get this new technology in as soon as possible. And our customers help us with the cash flow because we talked about R&D, and we talked about our assistance in the ZEISS business. So I think those are the most important parameters around the cash flow.\nAnalysts: Helpful. And just as a very quick follow-up, you obviously talked about these very high ASPs for High-NA. But there will be new iteration to the current generation of EUV, as I understand it, before we get to High-NA in coming years. So could you help us understand, should there be price inflation on these EUV machines in the meantime? And how should we think about that in the next couple of years?\nExecutives: Well, we -- with that, we will do what we always do. I mean, when we provide more value to the customer, we actually look at what that means for them in terms of the litho cost per wafer or litho cost per transistor, how you want to calculate it. And in fact, we just split that value increase 50-50. We've always done that. We've done that since the inception of the company. And of course, value is very much driven by productivity. This is why productivity improvements in the current EUV and NA will happen over time, over the next couple of years. And that will drive also the value, which we're going to split with our customers.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mr. C.J. Muse.\nAnalysts: I guess, Peter, first question. You've got the longest-lead time equipment in the industry. So curious, as you think about announced and unannounced greenfield capacity as well as emerging spend out of China, could you talk about visibility and how you're thinking about 2019? I know it's only April, but would love to hear your thoughts.\nExecutives: You're talking about 2019 for the total business or for China?\nAnalysts: Sorry, the question was specific to your Deep UV business in aggregate as you take into account the visibility you have plus your longer lead times.\nExecutives: Yes. I think you have to -- I think it's way too early to go anything -- to start guiding on 2019. But just qualitatively, it's all driven by 2 things. It's technology transitions. I think technology transitions, 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer, they need significant amounts of Deep UV machines. The 7-nanometer node, as Mark Liu also mentioned, is in the minds of a lot of people. 10/7 is a big node. So -- but that -- the context of big, you need to see in the context of the end demand, yes? So I mean, what we're currently seeing in memory, for instance, is also a big user of our Deep UV systems, and it's driven by the demand out of the data centers. So it is really -- as a question, what you're asking is really the question about, will we -- do we believe that the end demand will stick? It's strong today. Will it stick in 2019? I think the general belief, and I'm quoting also customers, is that they believe that it actually will, that the technology transitions will indeed happen. So the Deep UV demand for 2019 will be strong. That's our -- that's what we currently feel, yes? Now like I said, the end markets are really driving the ultimate demand for capacity extensions. And of course, we don't have a crystal ball, you don't have it, and we just have to see how that will develop over the next couple of quarters.\nAnalysts: Sure, that's helpful. And I guess as my follow-up, on the EUV side, I guess 2 quick ones if I could sneak it in there. The first part is, how do we think about gross margins into the second half given the pull-in of some of the deferred revenues? And then given that you pushed 2 tools into 2019, should we infer that 32 could be the new number? Or is that just not reasonable?\nExecutives: Yes. On the gross margin, I think it's right to assume that we are steadily increasing the margin. I mean, we're not spelling it out anymore because of movements between quarters and also how the gross margin is done and how we sell to customers. But in general, that is indeed the case. And we've also talked about our EUV business. I mean, you have seen, in the first half, we were over EUR 150 million in first quarter, 600 in the -- almost EUR 600 million in the second quarter. It was EUR 2.1 billion for the year, so you see we have 2 heavy quarters coming. So you can clearly assume that the margin is going up.\nExecutives: Yes. On the shift of the 2 systems, yes, I mean, if you do -- if we said 30 before, 30 plus 2 is 32, I think I can do that math. But you have to realize that we're looking into 2019 where we really need to also understand the cutoff. At the end of 2019, I don't know exactly what we are going to have because we're not fully booked for 2019 yet. So I think, to be -- to stay on the safe side, I will just say we said we are planning for shipping our capacity of 30 units. I would, for the time being, stay at the 30 units.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mr. Mehdi Hosseini.\nAnalysts: Actually, Peter, just as a follow-up, 7-nanometer plus wasn't supposed to lead to any meaningful changes to the design as it relates to the EUV insertion. It has -- it had more to do with demand set. But 5-nanometer is going to have some implication or improvement especially with the layout. When do you expect your customers will be able to provide those design libraries with the EUV insertion that would enable design community to better understand the cost benefit of EUV?\nExecutives: Well, I think actually, that's pretty fastened and is already as a key attention for our customers. I mean, that's a question really to ask our customers, but I can give you some qualitative indication. I mean, when we talk to our customers, they actually are very happy with the progress that they're making on their 5-nanometer designs also using EUV. As what we said before, it reduces the complexity. So I think we got some very good feedback there. Although we, of course, don't know exactly where they are with their customers and how they present their designs and their libraries to their customers. But -- we don't know, but the sounds that we're getting out of the customer base are optimistic, and I think it's corroborated by what they say publicly. We listen to our major customers and what they say about EUV. I mean, it's pretty bullish. So, that's not us, and that's the only thing I can say, Mehdi. I mean, we get similar feedback from them as they are publicly stating.\nAnalysts: Sure. And just a quick follow-on on DRAM. Last call, you talked about trying to target a 2,000 wafer per day throughput as a milestone for getting your DRAM customers incrementally upbeat about adoption of EUV. Where are we with those targets? And any incremental color on the DRAM adoption of EUV? Especially as you -- as we go from 1x to 1y, there's only 1- or 2-nanometer decline, and I'm not sure about the cost benefit. And is that impacting? And then any context of a throughput target? If you could provide any incremental color, it would be great.\nExecutives: Yes. I think we've always said, DRAM introduction will be for 1 or 2 layers, and it really depends on the specific customer's situation what they will go for. I think -- but you're right, I think the 2,000 wafer per day is kind of a generally accepted target in the DRAM space because of the lower cost that they can, of course, bear for their devices. I think 2,000 wafers per day is a function of the wafer per hour throughput, which we said we actually reached 25 and in -- at the customer's site and then 40 wafers per hour here at ASML. So that's good. And then it's a function of the availability, which is actually, we have a clear target of going over 90%. We're executing on that target with some good achievements made over the last quarter, especially on the collected degradation. We are getting the collected degradation under control, so we are a little bit ahead of our target there. So then -- and we're rolling out several improvements -- availability improvement, as we speak, which actually mean that we have some major upgrades ongoing in the field. So if you would take average availability today, that is hampered also by the fact that we have to take tools down to do those upgrades. So -- but it -- but that all looks very much that we're on target to reach our over 90% availability when customers need it.\nAnalysts: But that incremental improvement isn't enough to get you excited about 2019 shipment?\nExecutives: That remains to be seen. I mean, like I said, 1 to 2 layers. Whether it's 1 or going to be 2 layers is up to the customers to this, and we're early in the -- in Q2 of 2018. I think customers will change their minds as they see performance going up in the course of this year. I think that's what they will do. So they'll very likely -- and I'm a bit assessing the situation that -- of course, they won't tell us everything in detail, but they will have plan A and plan B, which is a 1-layer application or a 2-layer application. So -- and that really depends on the progress that they will see throughout the year, and that will drive their implementation in 2019. But like I said, we're on our targets -- we're on our way to meet our targets for 2,000 wafers per day for the DRAM application. There are many availability solutions that we're currently rolling out into the field. So throughout the year, we'll know more.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mr. Andrew Gardiner.\nAnalysts: It's Andrew Gardiner from Barclays. I had another one on EUV, perhaps more on the demand side than sort of your capacity supply side. Peter, a couple of quarters ago, you had said that sort of the theoretical demand you were seeing from customers was sort of about 30% above the 30-tool capacity that you had for 2019. There's quite a few questions out there in the market about sort of levels of commitment, levels of layers. You just said that customers are confident and they're comfortable with the progress you guys are making. And so therefore, you haven't seen any change in that -- in your expectation of the layers. So is -- it's 2 quarters on from when you first said that. Is the demand level for 2019 still at that kind of a level, so far outstripping the capacity today?\nExecutives: Yes. I think it is still over that capacity number. It is changing from time to time, up or down, because of the timing that our customers are currently looking at for their ramp because it is not only whether you use 6 or you use 10 layers, but it's also what is the wafer capacity that you are going to build. So I think it is -- there is some changes back and forth, up and down, which is driven more by how much wafer capacity do they want to build. That has less to do with the technology but more with the end demand. And that is still above our capacity -- build capacity.\nAnalysts: Okay. I suppose to put it another way, then sort of from a logic point of view, the 10 layers or more, you still stick to that sort of the layer count expectation?\nExecutives: Yes, but that is a method of how big is the end market. So it's also a way, a bit of how quickly do they want to ramp to a certain first phase of that node, yes? So that is also, of course, determining whether how much the end demand will be over our capacity.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mr. Pierre Ferragu.\nAnalysts: It's Pierre Ferragu from New Street Research. I'd just like to get back, Peter, on what you said about the memory markets, I listened well -- you have, like, very good insight in how capacity is building up and that you see it's meeting very well the capacity demand. My question is, it seems that it's costing way more in terms of [indiscernible]  today than it was a few years ago because your revenues from memory are very significant. So could you explain us, maybe is there an easy way to explain us why in order to increase its capacity, the industry needs to spend more today than it was maybe a few years ago? Is that because shrink is delivering less bit growth and then it [ rings ] to more capacity? And is that something you see as a new normal, as something that will be sustainable over time?\nExecutives: Well, it is clear that they are spending more now than they did a few years ago in terms of litho tools. It doesn't mean that your cost per bit goes up, no, because you're actually shrinking. So the cost per bit, even if you spend more on litho and on equipment, as -- I don't need to explain it to you. But then your cost per bit still goes up, and then that still goes down. But what we're currently seeing, and I think that's kind of -- it's been a long time that we've seen memory prices, especially DRAM prices, staying very strong and even growing, while you could argue the cost of manufacturing goes up. That tells you something. I mean, we've always said memory is a commodity, and a commodity has a high-price elasticity. Well, the price elasticity when prices go up doesn't mean that the demand goes down. No, it's just the opposite. I think the demand is extremely high, and that means that even customers that end customers are willing to pay the high prices. So for our memory customers, it's -- that's an easy choice you have in that market that wants your product more than you can deliver, which actually means you buy the capacity, which may be at higher wafer cost, but your margins are significantly higher because of the market situation. So it is just business. They will buy what they need if the end market is there. And what you will see, if the end market is not there, they will buy less, and they will just squeeze everything out of the current installed base. So I don't see the issue, yes? And I don't think customers see the issues because they see the end markets, they see their profit margins, they see the opportunities. We don't see, and certainly not in the DRAM space, an exaggerated buildup of supply. So they buy what they need, and it costs a bit more, but they also earn more.\nAnalysts: Okay, that's very clear. So cost of bit still comes down, but it just, over time, gets translated into more spending in lithography. And then maybe more specifically on NAND, you mentioned like plans, you started adding to their stack on 3D NAND, increasing the number of layers. Do you have an early insight on whether stacking up NAND like that is delivering on its promise in terms of where you're seeing the cost per bit. Do you have visibility on that already?\nExecutives: Well, the cost per bit, when you stack and you use historical yield assumptions for this type of device, then it's clear, the cost per bit goes down, yes? So now from a lithography point of view, it is also clear to us there will be stacks-of-stacks. I mean, that's what every customer confirms. Now the big question is, after how many stacks do you need another? Well, after how many layers do you need another stack? That might be different customer per customer. But that's a thing that is certain to us. So yes, cost per bit will go down with vertical scaling. But like I said earlier, the ultimate cost is also a function of a couple of things. And one of them, a very important thing is, of course, yield. When yields go up, cost per bit goes down. It's that simple.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mr. Dave Mulholland.\nAnalysts: It's David Mulholland from UBS. Just quickly on the -- you made a comment earlier to say you're still increasing your DUV capacity. And I guess over the next year or 2, as you start to ramp up EUV in volume more significantly, there's general expectation DUV will go into decline. So I'm just wondering if you can help us understand how you think about your DUV business over the next couple of years and why increase capacity now in that context?\nExecutives: I think when we say we increase capacity, don't think about adding square meters, building factories and putting tooling in. I mean, it's really, yes, you get a bit more people in because you just work somewhat longer hours. But the most important part is operational efficiency. So you're reducing cycle time in the factory and basically getting more machines out using -- at the same fixed cost. That's how you do it.\nAnalysts: Okay. So it's not to say that you suddenly got a more optimistic view on payer [indiscernible]  on a 2-, 3-year view?\nExecutives: No, no. I think we are increasing capacity because the customer demand is there. And like I said, you can do this in a couple of ways: by taking the long route, and that's basically building a factory and hiring people and don't change your processes; or you can drive down cycle times and just get more out of the same square meters. And that's what we're doing today. [indiscernible]   And it's cheaper.\nAnalysts: That's clear. And then just coming back on the EUV High-NA discussion, you've made a few comments on value and pricing. But just obviously, there's been quite a challenging ramp from a gross margin perspective as the initial ramp of EUVs come in. Do you expect that we'll see a similar challenge as we start to introduce High-NA, start low and then increase? Or will it be starting from a much better starting point given what you've already learned on EUV as we transition to High-NA?\nExecutives: Yes. We'll start from a much better starting point. You will always see that the first tools have a lower gross margin than the tools when you're in volume because you have the learning curve and the warranty that goes with that, which is always higher with the first tools. But like I said earlier, we have this agreement on our return on investment of the R&D and the CapEx we do with Carl Zeiss, which will translate into a reduction, a discount on the optics, which is the most expensive part of the entire tool. And the EUV source is the same source as we use in 0.33. So that learning curve will have kicked in by the time that we start shipping the High-NA tools.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mr. Douglas Smith.\nAnalysts: It's Doug Smith from Agency Partners. I saw that the wafer throughput for High-NA was actually higher than for low NA at 185 wafers per hour. Does that mean that the 2, low NA and High-NA, won't coexist, that High-NA will just take over eventually?\nExecutives: That's a good question. I mean, it used to be the case that when you introduce a new technology, that you see a cannibalization of the previous one, which will not be the case for High-NA EUV. High-NA EUV will be used for the absolute critical layers. It will be an expensive tool, EUR 268 million, but it will provide not only more productivity but also the geometrical shrink, as Wolfgang mentioned. So it means, for those layers where you need the shrink, you will apply the High-NA tool. For those layers where you don't need that shrink capability of a High-NA tool, you will use the 0.33 tool. So it's going be a mix and match. Everything that we're currently seeing and discussing with customers is going to be mix and match of 0.33 and the 0.55 NA tool. So that means that the 0.33 EUV tool will have a very long life.\nAnalysts: Okay, very clear. And one quick question. The metrology and inspection business looked like it had a pretty small quarter. Are there some issues going on in that business?\nExecutives: Oh, it was -- I don't know how you come to that conclusion. We had -- of course, the whole business is within our systems number, and a part of it is within our service number. But we didn't have a bad quarter. We -- this whole business is steadily increasing. And Holistic Lithography altogether is probably the strongest-growing business amongst all of our businesses.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mr. Adithya Metuku.\nAnalysts: It's Adi from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. So I have 2 questions. Firstly, looking at the growth drivers in 2018, you're saying you're confident that memory has increased in the last quarter. Can you give us some color on how much you see your memory tool revenues increasing this year in 2018? And secondly, just a clarification on the EUV shipments. Clearly, the shipment numbers were very different to the revenue recognition numbers. So how should we think about that as we go through the rest of the year?\nExecutives: I'll take the second one. You're right, if you take Q2, we guided to almost EUR 600 million on 3 shipments. So we are planning to achieve a very important milestone where we basically can recognize revenue at the point of shipment. We're confident that we'll achieve that, so that means we can recognize these 3 shipments right away when we ship them. But not only that. We can also recognize tools from Q1 and even Q4 that we had previously shipped. If you recall, Q1, we shipped 3 systems, and we recognized only one. So we basically have that catch-up order. And then from now on, you will see the revenue recognition at the time of shipment, so it's going to be much more in sync. So you have that one catch-up order in Q2.\nExecutives: Yes. And on the growth drivers for 2018, yes, it is memory. We've -- throughout the quarter, we've seen there's a steady increase of the -- or let's say a change in the demand plans from key memory customers. And when I try to analyze this, I think it is more focused on the DRAM situation. That's where we really saw -- from month to month, we saw an adjustment of the demand plans. And as we said earlier, it's not so much the order pattern, it's more the 18-month forecast, and more importantly, the next 9 months that we have to agree with the customer, taking into account our own lead time. And this is where we have seen this gradual increase in the end demand and making sense. I mean, if you look at the end markets, I mean, the DRAM obviously with the DRAM pricing, and look at the announced capacity additions over the last 3, 4 months, customers are reallocating memory types to free up space for memories where they can make most money, which in this case is DRAM. And all that's happened over the last 3, 4 months, and that drives up the demand. And we're able to respond to that demand because we have reduced our cycle times. So that -- it's -- that's what it is. It's just the more clarity that we've been given by our customers on what they need this year.\nAnalysts: Okay, understood. And just a quick follow-up if I could. There is a lot of concern around this news article that recently came out around Apple not using EUV at TSMC. Do you have any thoughts around that? And finally, just all the best to Wolfgang. I hope your time at Bayer is just as exciting as it's been at ASML.\nExecutives: I'll let Wolfgang answer that last one. Just listen, I mean, we never comment on what customers of customers say because, yes, this is always -- we hear this constantly, customer A is going to supplier B and then switches back to A. There's many, many rumors in this space. What we focus on is what our customers are telling us on what they need and the orders that they place and the commitments that they want from us in terms of their tool demand. And that has not changed actually. And this is why we have a very healthy backlog, and we took 9 EUV orders in Q2. So whatever is out there is going to be whatever it is in terms of rumors, but customers are committing hard euros to us to get tools. And that's what counts.\nExecutives: All right. Ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one last question. If you are unable to get through on this call and still have questions, please feel free to contact the ASML Investor Relations Department with your question.\nOperator: The last question will come from Ms. Tammy Qiu.\nAnalysts: Tammy Qiu from Berenberg. Firstly, can you talk briefly about what trend you are seeing at foundry and logic? Because from my understanding, apart from EUV momentum in the second half, foundry and logic should be stronger than your January expectation. Can you just talk us through what's the driver and what can be the early indication into beginning of 2019? And also, the second question is on multi-beam tools. You said that in the presentation, you already demonstrated the first 9-beam tool. And can you actually talk about what exactly can you bundle that tool with your new system so that you can have a high ASP with existing system? Or are you going to sell that, too, as individual tool? And also, what's the potential number of beams you can bundle into the single machine? Because from my understanding, everyone in the industry has been working on a real multi-beam tool for the past 2 decades, but no one has achieved anywhere close to commercialization.\nExecutives: Okay. Now the trends foundry and logic, like we said, we have a very detailed demand planning forecast process with our customers. I would agree with you that we see foundry and logic being very strong. I don't feel that we're currently looking at a significant uptick in that strong demand. I think it's been pretty well laid out. We feel pretty happy with this also in terms of business volume. So I think it's a bit too early to -- for us to currently help you with any indication on an accelerated growth in that area. I would love to do that, but I have to rely on our own process, and our own process says it's going to be pretty healthy, that it's pretty stable. Now on the e-beam, yes, 9-beam is a prototype, so we've made the -- we captured the first images. And as we showed also in the presentation, the more beams that you have, the more servers you can actually inspect in one go. So that means the whole focus is on maximizing the potential number of beams. And the -- since that is a productivity advantage, a significant one, that also means that the value out of a tool like that will be higher than a single tool. So you could actually say that the value of the tool scales with the number of beams. And that will also -- it's too early to give you an indication of what that would mean. We'd rather discuss it with our customers first. But the potential number of beams, we're not disclosing anything yet. I mean, there are several companies working on their solutions. We'd like to keep it a little bit to our chest, but the 9 beams is just first prototype to show that multi-beam works, and we're very hard to -- we're working very hard to maximize that to the point where we have the highest value out of this type of solution. But I can tell you one thing: it's going to be significantly more than 9 beams.\nExecutives: All right. Before we sign off, I'd like to remind you that we'll be hosting an Investor Day here at our headquarters in Veldhoven on the afternoon, November 8. We hope you'll be able to join us. \nNow on behalf of ASML's board and management, I'd like to thank you all for joining us today. Operator, if you could formally conclude the call, I would appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the ASML 2018 First Quarter Financial Results Conference Call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the ASML 2018 First Quarter Financial Results Conference Call on April 18, 2018. [Operator Instructions] \nI would now like to turn the conference call over to  Skip Miller. Go ahead, please, sir.\nExecutives: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. This is Skip Miller, Vice President, Investor Relations at ASML. Joining me today from ASML headquarters in Veldhoven, The Netherlands is ASML CEO, Peter Wennink; and CFO, Wolfgang Nickl. \nThe subject of today's call is ASML's 2018 first quarter results. Length of this call will be 60 minutes, and questions will be taken in the order that they were received. This call is also being broadcast live over the Internet at asml.com. A transcript of management's opening remarks and a replay of the call will be available on our website shortly following the conclusion of this call. \nBefore we begin, I'd like to caution listeners that comments made by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities law. These forward-looking statements involve material risks and uncertainties. For a discussion of risk factors, I encourage you to review the safe harbor statement contained in today's press release and presentation found on our website at asml.com and in ASML's annual report on Form 20-F and other documents as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. \nWith that, I would like to turn the call over to Peter Wennink for a brief introduction.\nExecutives: Thank you, Skip. Good morning and good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining us for our Q1 2018 results conference call. \nBefore we begin the question-and-answer session, Wolfgang and I would like to provide an overview and some commentary on the first quarter as well as provide our view of the coming quarters. Wolfgang will start with a review of our Q1 financial performance with added comments on our short-term outlook. I will complete the introduction with some additional comments, the current business environment and our future business outlook. \nWolfgang, if you will.\nExecutives: Thank you, Peter, and welcome, everyone. I will first highlight some of the first quarter accomplishments and then provide our guidance for the second quarter of 2018. \nQ1 net sales came in at EUR 2.29 billion, somewhat stronger than guided, driven by product mix and a strong DUV business. Net system sales of EUR 1.67 billion was primarily driven by strong memory revenue, which contributed 74% of sales. Logic, which now combines foundry and IDM sales, made up 26% of system sales. \nInstalled Base Management sales for the quarter came in at EUR 617 million, which was just above our guidance. Gross margin for the quarter came in at 48.7%, which was 70 basis points above the upper end of our guidance range, driven by both volume and mix. \nOverall OpEx came in slightly above guidance, with R&D expense at EUR 357 million and SG&A expenses at EUR 114 million. \nTurning to the balance sheet. We ended last quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at a level of EUR 3.19 billion. During the quarter, we purchased approximately EUR 170 million worth of shares. This means we still have EUR 2.33 billion of our 2018/2019 share buyback program remaining. \nMoving to the order book. Q1 system bookings came in at a strong EUR 2.44 billion. 57% of the order intake was from logic customers, driven by EUV. Memory made up the remaining 43% of our order volume, driven by Deep UV. We took 9 new EUV orders in the quarter. Additionally, we received 4 orders for High-NA R&D systems from 3 customers, and on top of this, we sold options for 8 High-NA early volume systems. \nHigh-NA is our next-generation EUV system, which will enable geometrical shrink beyond the next decade. The initial selling price for these High-NA systems is around EUR 270 million. We will receive 40% as a down payment, and the remaining 60% will be milestone based, with the majority of the milestone payments expected before shipment. The options were sold for EUR 50 million each, with payments starting this year. \nAt this point, I would like to comment on our reporting of bookings and backlog going forward. As we have communicated a number of times in the past, we establish our joint demand forecast with our customers, they are very routine and comprehensive planning cycles. Order flow can be lumpy and therefore does not always reflect our business accurately. We believe reporting bookings and backlog provides limited value, and therefore, backlog will no longer be reported. If we want to provide some additional visibility during our initial EUV ramp phase, we will continue to report bookings throughout this year. We currently plan to no longer report bookings beginning in 2019. \nWith that, I would like to turn to our expectations and guidance for the second quarter of 2018. We expect Q2 total net sales between EUR 2.5 billion and EUR 2.6 billion. Our total net sales forecast includes almost EUR 600 million for our EUV business, while we target to ship 3 EUV systems in the quarter. Our Q2 EUV revenue forecast is a combination of revenue upon shipment and deferred revenue from prior quarters. This catch-up of deferred revenue was previously forecasted for the second half of the year. \nOn EUV revenue guidance, we have communicated that we will provide quarterly guidance until we are recognizing the majority of revenue for a system at the time of its shipment. We expect this to happen in Q2 and will therefore no longer provide quarterly EUV revenue guidance starting in 2019. \nFor the full year, our shipment plan has changed from 22 to 20 EUV systems. The change was due to a combination of anticipated end-of-year shipment logistic challenges due to multiple shipments in the fourth quarter as well as customer fab readiness. The 2 affected systems this year will ship early 2019 and will not impact customers' EUV production ramp plans. As a result of this adjustment, our EUV revenue for 2018 is now expected to be around EUR 2.1 billion versus EUR 2.3 billion that we had indicated previously. I would like to highlight, though, that we expect this reduction to be more than compensated by stronger DUV and applications businesses. We expect our Q2 Installed Base Management revenue to again come in around EUR 600 million. \nGross margin for the quarter is expected to be around 43%, impacted by the significant increase in EUV sales in the quarter. \nR&D expenses for Q2 will reflect continued accelerated investments in our portfolio and will come in at around EUR 375 million. SG&A is expected to come in at about EUR 115 million. \nWe have started a new share buyback program for 2018 and 2019 of up to EUR 2.5 billion. In Q1, EUR 170 million worth of shares were repurchased. Additionally, we have also proposed a 17% increase in our dividend to EUR 1.40 per share through our Annual Shareholder Meeting, which takes place on April 25 here in Veldhoven. The dividend payment is valued at around EUR 600 million. \nWe are excited about 2018. Customers' demand for our products continues to be strong, with strengthening demand in DUV as well as applications. In addition, we see strong demand for EUV as customers ramp this technology in production and have committed to this next-generation technology. We look forward to a year of continued strong growth in both revenue and profitability. \nWith that, I would like to turn the call back over to you, Peter.\nExecutives: Thank you, Wolfgang. I would like to start off by announcing a major milestone reached this quarter regarding our next-generation EUV technology of high numerical aperture or High-NA. We have aligned our development time line with customers, and we received orders for 4 High-NA R&D systems from 3 leading semiconductor manufacturers, targeted to start shipping in Q4 2021. We also sold to customers options to buy 8 early volume systems targeted to start shipping in 2024. Now this is a significant milestone in that it demonstrates customers' commitment to EUV technology for future nodes and provides great growth opportunity as we extend lithography technology beyond the next decade. \nI will highlight some of the key product features in more detail later, but I would like to first address our view of the business and the demand drivers. As Wolfgang highlighted, had a good start to the year, and our business continues to perform very well. The positive industry environment and increasing litho intensity as customers migrate to more advanced nodes continues to drive strong demand for our products in both logic and memory markets. \nAlthough this not -- this does not come as a surprise, we're increasingly optimistic about our 2018 outlook as compared to a quarter ago as we see strengthening demand in memory while logic demand remains solid. Based on expected growth and current guidance, we expect to see a significant increase in revenue in the second half of the year. And in [ some ways ] stronger Deep UV will be primarily driven by memory, and stronger EUV will be primarily driven by logic. \nWe plan to ship to over 15 greenfield fabs in 2018. It may be interesting to note that of these fabs, the majority will be in the China region, of which 7 are for domestic Chinese customers. \nMemory strength in both DRAM and NAND is driven by increasing content as well as expanding end market applications. In DRAM, our customers continue to migrate to the 1x nanometer node along with required wafer capacity additions to meet the increased bit demand. In NAND, a number of customers continue to ramp greenfield -- new greenfield fabs and scale vertically via stack-of-stacks, which requires additional lithography. \nWith strengthening demand in both DRAM and NAND, we see significant year-over-year growth. Based on current third-party estimates for both DRAM and NAND bit demand growth against our view of bit supply growth, we don't see major concerns regarding supply-demand balance throughout the year. \nLogic demand continues to be solid as customers ramp 10- and 7-nanometer nodes, while the initial demand for the latter, the 7-nanometer node, is the primary driver behind the significant increase in EUV demand in this year. \nOn the ASML product side, let me start with an update of our EUV business. In EUV, we continue to make progress as this technology starts to ramp in volume production. We delivered a configuration that achieved 125 wafers per hour at a customer site and continue to drive improvements in throughput performance, demonstrating 140 wafers per hour at ASML factories. We continue to focus on improving availability and work with our customers in support of infrastructure around EUV and volume production. \nDemand from our customers continues to be strong as they start ramping this technology in production. With a plan of 20 shipments in 2018, this represents a doubling of output over last year's shipments. As we now move into the volume phase of this new technology ramp, we will focus our operations and industrialization efforts on managing our supply chain and helping our customers with their fab readiness preparations. \nAs Wolfgang mentioned, we have shifted 2 systems to early 2019 due to a combination of customer fab readiness and anticipated challenges regarding the logistics around year-end shipments. However, based on our discussions with customers, our previously communicated estimates of their EUV layer adoption plans remain unchanged. As a reflection of their continued commitment to EUV production plans, we took orders for 9 NXE:3400 systems this quarter in support of our 2019 shipment plan of at least 30 systems. \nAs mentioned in my introduction, High-NA is our next-generation EUV technology, which extends lithography and enables cost-effective scaling beyond the next decade. The NA of the new optical system will increase from 0.33 on current EUV systems to 0.55 on High-NA systems. \nIn addition to new advanced optics driving improvements in imaging, platform innovations in stage technology will drive improvements in overlay and productivity. We're currently targeting an initial increase in productivity to 185 wafers per hour. Last year's investments in Carl Zeiss SMT will further solidify our development time line and reduces the execution risk. And with the addition of High-NA, ASML's product portfolio will include 0.33 NA, 0.55 NA \nEUV, dry and immersion Deep UV, i-Line as well as holistic products, all designed to work together seamlessly in production. \nIn Deep UV, we will increase our factory output to meet the market demand. Furthermore, our focus on productivity means we continue to boost our new system output, and we expect to exceed the record productivity level reached last year. \nIn addition to increasing the maximum configuration output per system, we are also continuously increasing productivity of our systems in the field. For instance, we achieved an output of 6,000 wafers per day on NXT systems in a NAND fab, which translates to a 5% increase in productivity over a 12-month period. With both increased system shipment output as well as productivity increases of systems in the fab, we are delivering further value to our customers via capacity and cost efficiency. \nIn Holistic Lithography, we continue to see growth across our full portfolio of software and metrology products. Our YieldStar metrology continues to gain broadening adoption, with recent growth via expansion in the memory market. We also shipped our first YieldStar 1375 system, which measures actual in-device lithography performance, enabling more accurate measurements of the device and thus driving yield improvements. We've shipped multiple pattern fidelity metrology tools, ePfm5, and are seeing initial positive customer results. This technology, where ASML's high-resolution e-beam technology is combined with our computational lithography software, will enable e-beam-based feedback to the scanner and deliver improved yield performance in volume production. \nTo further drive e-beam productivity performance and expand application opportunity in volume production, we are developing multi-beam technology. We successfully captured first images from our 3-by-3 beam proof-of-concept system. We see great growth opportunity in holistic litho business and expect its growth rate to exceed our overall revenue growth in the coming years. \nTo summarize, this year, we expect solid growth in both sales and profitability. We are more optimistic about our view of the year than we were a quarter ago due to the continued strengthening of memory demand while logic demand continues to be solid. We are on track to achieve our 2020 targets, with significant growth potential beyond 2020. We plan to communicate our growth opportunity beyond 2020 at our Investor Day on November 8 this year. \nAnd so last but not least, as many of you know, this quarterly call is the last call with Wolfgang online helping us to bring clarity to our results and operations. It goes without saying that at least with ASML, we'll miss him dearly, and we'd like to take the opportunity to thank him wholeheartedly for his invaluable contribution to ASML. Wish him all the best in his new challenge at Bayer, and we will follow him closely, you can rest assured. \nAnd with that, we will be happy to take your questions.\nExecutives: All right. Thank you, Wolfgang and Peter. Ladies and gentlemen, the operator will instruct you momentarily on the protocol for the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] Now operator, we have your final instructions and then the first question, please.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Mr. Farhan Ahmad.\nAnalysts: All right. Farhan Ahmad from Crédit Suisse. My first question is in regards to China on -- did I hear correctly that now you're seeing 7 domestic companies in China, whereas on the last call, you had mentioned 5? Can you just talk about what customer activity are you seeing in China? And how is it split between memory and logic foundry?\nExecutives: Yes. I think China is a rapidly developing market, but I have to tell you that these are -- like we said in the prepared remarks, these are greenfield fabs of different sizes but also 200-millimeter fabs. They are 200-millimeter initiatives. So it is -- basically expands across all segments. It's logic, DRAM, NAND, logic being foundry. There's DRAM initiatives. There is NAND initiatives. So it's the -- I would say, it's the entire breadth of the business that we're covering. And yes, it is moving, but we have to say these are greenfield fabs, which have a different pattern or an expected different pattern of ramping. Many of those fabs put in a first line to qualify the process, to qualify first product, which will take some time. So we have to be careful with -- although the number is significant, 7, we have to be a bit careful with the assessment of the speed with which they will ramp up, which will be a function of the successes that they have in qualifying process and product.\nAnalysts: Got it. And then one quick question on the sustainability of memory shipments that you have seen this year. On your comments, you talked about the sustainability. Can you talk about some of the analytics that you have done that give you confidence that the memory demand that you're seeing is sustainable? And also, if I look at your orders, the orders in memory had declined a lot. Is that an indication that the customers are being disciplined in how they are ordering, and even though the memory industry profitability is very high, they're kind of building to meet the supply -- the demand that they are seeing?\nExecutives: Yes. First, to talk about memory you have to split between DRAM and NAND, the way that we calculate this is that of course, we don't know what the bit demand will be. So we focus -- basically, we use the available data from industry analysts, and we corroborate that with discussions that we have with customers and see how customers see this. I must admit that personally, I have sometimes the view that we're parroting after each other. We're all using the same percentages. There's not a lot of difference there. So this is on the bit demand side. Now what we know better is the bit supply side. We know pretty well how many tools are out there. We know pretty well how they are used in terms of availability and throughput. We pretty know -- we know pretty well what kind of technology is actually used, so we can calculate the bit supply pretty well as installed and as planned to be shipped. Now with DRAM, that's pretty accurate because we know this pretty well. With NAND, it's a bit of a caveat there as you have to make certain assumptions on the mix of layer stacks and the timing of when they increase layer stacks and, of course, some assumptions on the yields that they are having. Now you could argue that ASML might not be the most or the best-positioned company to have an insight in there, but we work with what we know and what we hear. So this is what we then use, basically applying the same methodologies with DRAM, taking how many systems do we have in the field, what's the productivity, what is our assumption on the mix of the layer stacks out there and so on, yield assumption. And that's how we come to this view that we currently have that supply and demand are pretty much in balance for this year, taking into account the caveats, which I think there are a little more caveats in there than there are in DRAM as far as our insights are concerned. On the order trends, well, actually, you're giving exactly the argument why we stop giving order guidance because it -- you can draw easily very strange conclusions for it. I mean, the way that we plan our shipments is an 18-months in-depth view with our customers on their expansion plans, on their capacity rollout plans and on  technology transitions. And orders come in from a very few customers in batches. So it doesn't say anything. When we give you guidance on what we believe the memory business is, it is based not on the order flow, it is based on the continued discussions we have with our customers on their ramp-up plans, their technology transitions. And that really drives our view of the business, not the order intake.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mr. Sandeep Deshpande.\nAnalysts: I have 2 questions. Firstly, for Wolfgang. I'm trying to understand the R&D guidance that you have given. The R&D guidance for Q2 is higher than the 2020, even if you took an absolute amount on your 2020 guidance, 13% of EUR 11 billion, on a quarterly basis, it is higher. Why it is higher? And is it going to sustainably remain higher? And secondly, if it is going to remain higher, why are you not capitalizing some of this R&D, given that, I mean, just what Peter said in his prepared remarks that some of these shipments on High-NA EUV are really going to happen in 2024, et cetera? So it's a very long way away as yet. And secondly, Peter, I have a question overall on the High-NA EUV business. Is the cost structure any different with -- in High-NA EUV given that Carl Zeiss is going to be such a important supplier there? I mean, clearly, it's an important supplier now and probably yet even more important supplier. And I'd like to thank you, Wolfgang, for all your support over the last few years while you were CFO of ASML.\nExecutives: Okay. Thanks, Sandeep. As it relates to R&D, we have taken the investments up. We're very heavily investing in High-NA, both here at ASML and through our High-NA agreement order size. But we are also investing heavily in Holistic Lithography in the guided beam and the multi-beam solutions. We do firmly keep our 13% of revenue envelope in mind, and we're not going to be quite there this year, but we're going to make progress year-over-year in terms of a percent of revenues that will keep that in front of us. As it relates to the capitalization, that's a function of the accounting rules. And as you know, when we talk to you, we talk based on our U.S. GAAP numbers. And there, you simply have to expense it. If you're interested in the capitalized version, you can always look at our IFRS numbers that we don't use internally in the management process where they get capitalized. Quite frankly, at the end of the day, it's all about cash flow. And there, you don't have a difference. So we manage ourselves based on the U.S. GAAP numbers, which we also, quite frankly, like because it's a bit more conservative.\nExecutives: Yes. On your second question on will there be a different cost structure on the High-NA EUV business, I think from a product cost, yes. I think [ from the start ], there will be optics in there. Of course, it will be the EUV source there. But I think in terms of the cost buildup, it will be somewhat different. To start with the optics, I mean, I think we explained this before. We've taken an equity interest in Carl Zeiss, but also, we've agreed with them that we will co-fund their R&D as well as their CapEx. And the way that we get repaid on that funding is that we run this as a \"2 companies and one business\" kind of venture. So it means that we should both have -- and there's an equal internal rate of return. Only as you can imagine, if we put significantly more absolute euros in there than they do, then of course, somehow you need to get an absolute euro return, which is also significantly higher. And the way that we balance this or we compensate this is through the lens price. So it actually means that it's a pre-investment whereby you get a discount on the lens price to get a return on your investment. So that's one, and that's different than what we do today. And secondly, we use a -- we will use with High-NA the same source, the same EUV source, which is the source that we're currently using also for 0.33 NA. So all that, you could say a learning curve of that cost price of the current source will be captured by the time that we start shipping High-NA. I think those will be the 2 main drivers for a different cost structure in High-NA as compared to 0.33 NA, which should have a positive impact on the gross margin to start with.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mr. Hameed Awan.\nAnalysts: Yes. It's actually Alex Duval from Goldman Sachs. Just wanted to clarify very quickly what you said in terms of the High-NA orders and option sales. Can I just clarify that you said the average selling price is actually EUR 170 million for the original tool sale? And therefore, how should we be thinking about the total amount of cash that you'll be getting from those initial 4 orders and when we get that?\nExecutives: Alex, so just to be clear, 2-7-0, that's EUR 270 million is the initial price of this tool. And the way how the arrangement has been done on the R&D tools is that we get 40% right away. And then there are 6 equal milestone-based payments that will happen for the next couple of years. And like I said in the prepared remark, we expect the majority of these payments will be in before the shipment actually happens. And then on top of that, we sold 8 options for early volume shipments, and they go at EUR 50, 5-0, million apiece, and those payments start this year. So it does exactly what we designed it for. We go through an accelerated development program to get this new technology in as soon as possible. And our customers help us with the cash flow because we talked about R&D, and we talked about our assistance in the ZEISS business. So I think those are the most important parameters around the cash flow.\nAnalysts: Helpful. And just as a very quick follow-up, you obviously talked about these very high ASPs for High-NA. But there will be new iteration to the current generation of EUV, as I understand it, before we get to High-NA in coming years. So could you help us understand, should there be price inflation on these EUV machines in the meantime? And how should we think about that in the next couple of years?\nExecutives: Well, we -- with that, we will do what we always do. I mean, when we provide more value to the customer, we actually look at what that means for them in terms of the litho cost per wafer or litho cost per transistor, how you want to calculate it. And in fact, we just split that value increase 50-50. We've always done that. We've done that since the inception of the company. And of course, value is very much driven by productivity. This is why productivity improvements in the current EUV and NA will happen over time, over the next couple of years. And that will drive also the value, which we're going to split with our customers.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mr. C.J. Muse.\nAnalysts: I guess, Peter, first question. You've got the longest-lead time equipment in the industry. So curious, as you think about announced and unannounced greenfield capacity as well as emerging spend out of China, could you talk about visibility and how you're thinking about 2019? I know it's only April, but would love to hear your thoughts.\nExecutives: You're talking about 2019 for the total business or  for China?\nAnalysts: Sorry, the question was specific to your Deep UV business in aggregate as you take into account the visibility you have plus your longer lead times.\nExecutives: Yes. I think you have to -- I think it's way too early to go anything -- to start guiding on 2019. But just qualitatively, it's all driven by 2 things. It's technology transitions. I think technology transitions, 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer, they need significant amounts of Deep UV machines. The 7-nanometer node, as Mark Liu also mentioned, is in the minds of a lot of people. 10/7 is a big node. So -- but that -- the context of big, you need to see in the context of the end demand, yes? So I mean, what we're currently seeing in memory, for instance, is also a big user of our Deep UV systems, and it's driven by the demand out of the data centers. So it is really -- as a question, what you're asking is really the question about, will we -- do we believe that the end demand will stick? It's strong today. Will it stick in 2019? I think the general belief, and I'm quoting also customers, is that they believe that it actually will, that the technology transitions will indeed happen. So the Deep UV demand for 2019 will be strong. That's our -- that's what we currently feel, yes? Now like I said, the end markets are really driving the ultimate demand for capacity extensions. And of course, we don't have a crystal ball, you don't have it, and we just have to see how that will develop over the next couple of quarters.\nAnalysts: Sure, that's helpful. And I guess as my follow-up, on the EUV side, I guess 2 quick ones if I could sneak it in there. The first part is, how do we think about gross margins into the second half given the pull-in of some of the deferred revenues? And then given that you pushed 2 tools into 2019, should we infer that 32 could be the new number? Or is that just not reasonable?\nExecutives: Yes. On the gross margin, I think it's right to assume that we are steadily increasing the margin. I mean, we're not spelling it out anymore because of movements between quarters and also how the gross margin is done and how we sell to customers. But in general, that is indeed the case. And we've also talked about our EUV business. I mean, you have seen, in the first half, we were over EUR 150 million in first quarter, 600 in the -- almost EUR 600 million in the second quarter. It was EUR 2.1 billion for the year, so you see we have 2 heavy quarters coming. So you can clearly assume that the margin is going up.\nExecutives: Yes. On the shift of the 2 systems, yes, I mean, if you do -- if we said 30 before, 30 plus 2 is 32, I think I can do that math. But you have to realize that we're looking into 2019 where we really need to also understand the cutoff. At the end of 2019, I don't know exactly what we are going to have because we're not fully booked for 2019 yet. So I think, to be -- to stay on the safe side, I will just say we said we are planning for shipping our capacity of 30 units. I would, for the time being, stay at the 30 units.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mr. Mehdi Hosseini.\nAnalysts: Actually, Peter, just as a follow-up, 7-nanometer plus wasn't supposed to lead to any meaningful changes to the design as it relates to the EUV insertion. It has -- it had more to do with demand set. But 5-nanometer is going to have some implication or improvement especially with the layout. When do you expect your customers will be able to provide those design libraries with the EUV insertion that would enable design community to better understand the cost benefit of EUV?\nExecutives: Well, I think actually, that's pretty fastened and is already as a key attention for our customers. I mean, that's a question really to ask our customers, but I can give you some qualitative indication. I mean, when we talk to our customers, they actually are very happy with the progress that they're making on their 5-nanometer designs also using EUV. As what we said before, it reduces the complexity. So I think we got some very good feedback there. Although we, of course, don't know exactly where they are with their customers and how they present their designs and their libraries to their customers. But -- we don't know, but the sounds that we're getting out of the customer base are optimistic, and I think it's corroborated by what they say publicly. We listen to our major customers and what they say about EUV. I mean, it's pretty bullish. So, that's not us, and that's the only thing I can say, Mehdi. I mean, we get similar feedback from them as they are publicly stating.\nAnalysts: Sure. And just a quick follow-on on DRAM. Last call, you talked about trying to target a 2,000 wafer per day throughput as a milestone for getting your DRAM customers incrementally upbeat about adoption of EUV. Where are we with those targets? And any incremental color on the DRAM adoption of EUV? Especially as you -- as we go from 1x to 1y, there's only 1- or 2-nanometer decline, and I'm not sure about the cost benefit. And is that impacting? And then any context of a throughput target? If you could provide any incremental color, it would be great.\nExecutives: Yes. I think we've always said, DRAM introduction will be for 1 or 2 layers, and it really depends on the specific customer's situation what they will go for. I think -- but you're right, I think the 2,000 wafer per day is kind of a generally accepted target in the DRAM space because of the lower cost that they can, of course, bear for their devices. I think 2,000 wafers per day is a function of the wafer per hour throughput, which we said we actually reached 25 and in -- at the customer's site and then 40 wafers per hour here at ASML. So that's good. And then it's a function of the availability, which is actually, we have a clear target of going over 90%. We're executing on that target with some good achievements made over the last quarter, especially on the collected degradation. We are getting the collected degradation under control,  so we are a little bit ahead of our target there. So then -- and we're rolling out several improvements -- availability improvement, as we speak, which actually mean that we have some major upgrades ongoing in the field. So if you would take average availability today, that is hampered also by the fact that we have to take tools down to do those upgrades. So -- but it -- but that all looks very much that we're on target to reach our over 90% availability when customers need it.\nAnalysts: But that incremental improvement isn't enough to get you excited about 2019 shipment?\nExecutives: That remains to be seen. I mean, like I said, 1 to 2 layers. Whether it's 1 or going to be 2 layers is up to the customers to this, and we're early in the -- in Q2 of 2018. I think customers will change their minds as they see performance going up in the course of this year. I think that's what they will do. So they'll very likely -- and I'm a bit assessing the situation that -- of course, they won't tell us everything in detail, but they will have plan A and plan B, which is a 1-layer application or a 2-layer application. So -- and that really depends on the progress that they will see throughout the year, and that will drive their implementation in 2019. But like I said, we're on our targets -- we're on our way to meet our targets for 2,000 wafers per day for the DRAM application. There are many availability solutions that we're currently rolling out into the field. So throughout the year, we'll know more.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mr. Andrew Gardiner.\nAnalysts: It's Andrew Gardiner from Barclays. I had another one on EUV, perhaps more on the demand side than sort of your capacity supply side. Peter, a couple of quarters ago, you had said that sort of the theoretical demand you were seeing from customers was sort of about 30% above the 30-tool capacity that you had for 2019. There's quite a few questions out there in the market about sort of levels of commitment, levels of layers. You just said that customers are confident and they're comfortable with the progress you guys are making. And so therefore, you haven't seen any change in that -- in your expectation of the layers. So is -- it's 2 quarters on from when you first said that. Is the demand level for 2019 still at that kind of a level, so far outstripping the capacity today?\nExecutives: Yes. I think it is still over that capacity number. It is changing from time to time, up or down, because of the timing that our customers are currently looking at for their ramp because it is not only whether you use 6 or you use 10 layers, but it's also what is the wafer capacity that you are going to build. So I think it is -- there is some changes back and forth, up and down, which is driven more by how much wafer capacity do they want to build. That has less to do with the technology but more with the end demand. And that is still above our capacity -- build capacity.\nAnalysts: Okay. I suppose to put it another way, then sort of from a logic point of view, the 10 layers or more, you still stick to that sort of the layer count expectation?\nExecutives: Yes, but that is a method of how big is the end market. So it's also a way, a bit of how quickly do they want to ramp to a certain first phase of that node, yes? So that is also, of course, determining whether how much the end demand will be over our capacity.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mr. Pierre Ferragu.\nAnalysts: It's Pierre Ferragu from New Street Research. I'd just like to get back, Peter, on what you said about the memory markets, I listened well -- you have, like, very good insight in how capacity is building up and that you see it's meeting very well the capacity demand. My question is, it seems that it's costing way more in terms of [indiscernible]   today than it was a few years ago because your revenues from memory are very significant. So could you explain us, maybe is there an easy way to explain us why in order to increase its capacity, the industry needs to spend more today than it was maybe a few years ago? Is that because shrink is delivering less bit growth and then it [ rings ] to more capacity? And is that something you see as a new normal, as something that will be sustainable over time?\nExecutives: Well, it is clear that they are spending more now than they did a few years ago in terms of litho tools. It doesn't mean that your cost per bit goes up, no, because you're actually shrinking. So the cost per bit, even if you spend more on litho and on equipment, as -- I don't need to explain it to you. But then your cost per bit still goes up, and then that still goes down. But what we're currently seeing, and I think that's kind of -- it's been a long time that we've seen memory prices, especially DRAM prices, staying very strong and even growing, while you could argue the cost of manufacturing goes up. That tells you something. I mean, we've always said memory is a commodity, and a commodity has a high-price elasticity. Well, the price elasticity when prices go up doesn't mean that the demand goes down. No, it's just the opposite. I think the demand is extremely high, and that means that even customers that end customers are willing to pay the high prices. So for our memory customers, it's -- that's an easy choice you have in that market that wants your product more than you can deliver, which actually means you buy the capacity, which may be at higher wafer cost, but your margins are significantly higher because of the market situation. So it is just business. They will buy what they need if the end market is there. And what you will see, if the end market is not there, they will buy less, and they will just squeeze everything out of the current installed base. So I don't see the issue, yes? And I don't think customers see the issues because they see the end markets, they see their profit margins, they see the opportunities. We don't see, and certainly not in the DRAM space, an exaggerated buildup of supply. So they buy what they need, and it costs a bit more, but they also earn more.\nAnalysts: Okay, that's very clear. So cost of bit  still  comes down, but it just, over time, gets translated into more spending in lithography. And then maybe more specifically on NAND, you mentioned like plans, you started adding to their stack on 3D NAND, increasing the number of layers. Do you have an early insight on whether stacking up NAND like that is delivering on its promise in terms of where you're seeing the cost per bit. Do you have visibility on that already?\nExecutives: Well, the cost per bit, when you stack and you use historical yield assumptions for this type of device, then it's clear, the cost per bit goes down, yes? So now from a lithography point of view, it is also clear to us there will be stacks-of-stacks. I mean, that's what every customer confirms. Now the big question is, after how many stacks do you need another? Well, after how many layers do you need another stack? That might be different customer per customer. But that's a thing that is certain to us. So yes, cost per bit will go down with vertical scaling. But like I said earlier, the ultimate cost is also a function of a couple of things. And one of them, a very important thing is, of course, yield. When yields go up, cost per bit goes down. It's that simple.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mr. Dave Mulholland.\nAnalysts: It's David Mulholland from UBS. Just quickly on the -- you made a comment earlier to say you're still increasing your DUV capacity. And I guess over the next year or 2, as you start to ramp up EUV in volume more significantly, there's general expectation DUV will go into decline. So I'm just wondering if you can help us understand how you think about your DUV business over the next couple of years and why increase capacity now in that context?\nExecutives: I think when we say we increase capacity, don't think about adding square meters, building factories and putting tooling in. I mean, it's really, yes, you get a bit more people in because you just work somewhat longer hours. But the most important part is operational efficiency. So you're reducing cycle time in the factory and basically getting more machines out using -- at the same fixed cost. That's how you do it.\nAnalysts: Okay. So it's not to say that you suddenly got a more optimistic view on payer [indiscernible]  on a 2-, 3-year view?\nExecutives: No, no. I think we are increasing capacity because the customer demand is there. And like I said, you can do this in a couple of ways: by taking the long route, and that's basically building a factory and hiring people and don't change your processes; or you can drive down cycle times and just get more out of the same square meters. And that's what we're doing today. [indiscernible]   And it's cheaper.\nAnalysts: That's clear. And then just coming back on the EUV High-NA discussion, you've made a few comments on value and pricing. But just obviously, there's been quite a challenging ramp from a gross margin perspective as the initial ramp of EUVs come in. Do you expect that we'll see a similar challenge as we start to introduce High-NA, start low and then increase? Or will it be starting from a much better starting point given what you've already learned on EUV as we transition to High-NA?\nExecutives: Yes. We'll start from a much better starting point. You will always see that the first tools have a lower gross margin than the tools when you're in volume because you have the learning curve and the warranty that goes with that, which is always higher with the first tools. But like I said earlier, we have this agreement on our return on investment of the R&D and the CapEx we do with Carl Zeiss, which will translate into a reduction, a discount on the optics, which is the most expensive part of the entire tool. And the EUV source is the same source as we use in 0.33. So that learning curve will have kicked in by the time that we start shipping the High-NA tools.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mr. Douglas Smith.\nAnalysts: It's Doug Smith from Agency Partners. I saw that the wafer throughput for High-NA was actually higher than for low NA at 185 wafers per hour. Does that mean that the 2, low NA and High-NA, won't coexist, that High-NA will just take over eventually?\nExecutives: That's a good question. I mean, it used to be the case that when you introduce a new technology, that you see a cannibalization of the previous one, which will not be the case for High-NA EUV. High-NA EUV will be used for the absolute critical layers. It will be an expensive tool, EUR 268 million, but it will provide not only more productivity but also the geometrical shrink, as Wolfgang mentioned. So it means, for those layers where you need the shrink, you will apply the High-NA tool. For those layers where you don't need that shrink capability of a High-NA tool, you will use the 0.33 tool. So it's going be a mix and match. Everything that we're currently seeing and discussing with customers is going to be mix and match of 0.33 and the 0.55 NA tool. So that means that the 0.33 EUV tool will have a very long life.\nAnalysts: Okay,  very clear. And one quick question. The metrology and inspection business looked like it had a pretty small quarter. Are there some issues going on in that business?\nExecutives: Oh, it was -- I don't know how you come to that conclusion. We had -- of course, the whole business is within our systems number, and a part of it is within our service number. But we didn't have a bad quarter. We -- this whole business is steadily increasing. And Holistic Lithography altogether is probably the strongest-growing business amongst all of our businesses.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mr. Adithya Metuku.\nAnalysts: It's Adi from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. So I have 2 questions. Firstly, looking at the growth drivers in 2018, you're saying you're confident that memory has increased in the last quarter. Can you give us some color on how much you see your memory tool revenues increasing this year in 2018? And secondly, just a clarification on the EUV shipments. Clearly, the shipment numbers were very different to the revenue recognition numbers. So how should we think about that as we go through the rest of the year?\nExecutives: I'll take the second one. You're right, if you take Q2, we guided to almost EUR 600 million on 3 shipments. So we are planning to achieve a very important milestone where we basically can recognize revenue at the point of shipment. We're confident that we'll achieve that, so that means we can recognize these 3 shipments right away when we ship them. But not only that. We can also recognize tools from Q1 and even Q4 that we had previously shipped. If you recall, Q1, we shipped 3 systems, and we recognized only one. So we basically have that catch-up order. And then from now on, you will see the revenue recognition at the time of shipment, so it's going to be much more in sync. So you have that one catch-up order in Q2.\nExecutives: Yes. And on the growth drivers for 2018, yes, it is memory. We've -- throughout the quarter, we've seen there's a steady increase of the -- or let's say a change in the demand plans from key memory customers. And when I try to analyze this, I think it is more focused on the DRAM situation. That's where we really saw -- from month to month, we saw an adjustment of the demand plans. And as we said earlier, it's not so much the order pattern, it's more the 18-month forecast, and more importantly, the next 9 months that we have to agree with the customer, taking into account our own lead time. And this is where we have seen this gradual increase in the end demand and making sense. I mean, if you look at the end markets, I mean, the DRAM obviously with the DRAM pricing, and look at the announced capacity additions over the last 3, 4 months, customers are reallocating memory types to free up space for memories where they can make most money, which in this case is DRAM. And all that's happened over the last 3, 4 months, and that drives up the demand. And we're able to respond to that demand because we have reduced our cycle times. So that -- it's -- that's what it is.  It's just the more clarity that we've been given by our customers on what they need this year.\nAnalysts: Okay, understood. And just a quick follow-up if I could. There is a lot of concern around this news article that recently came out around Apple not using EUV at TSMC. Do you have any thoughts around that? And finally, just all the best to Wolfgang. I hope your time at Bayer is just as exciting as it's been at ASML.\nExecutives: I'll let Wolfgang answer that last one. Just listen, I mean, we never comment on what customers of customers say because, yes, this is always -- we hear this constantly, customer A is going to supplier B and then switches back to A. There's many, many rumors in this space. What we focus on is what our customers are telling us on what they need and the orders that they place and the commitments that they want from us in terms of their tool demand. And that has not changed actually. And this is why we have a very healthy backlog, and we took 9 EUV orders in Q2. So whatever is out there is going to be whatever it is in terms of rumors, but customers are committing hard euros to us to get tools. And that's what counts.\nExecutives: All right. Ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one last question. If you are unable to get through on this call and still have questions, please feel free to contact the ASML Investor Relations Department with your question.\nOperator: The last question will come from Ms. Tammy Qiu.\nAnalysts: Tammy Qiu from Berenberg. Firstly, can you talk briefly about what trend you are seeing at foundry and logic? Because from my understanding, apart from EUV momentum in the second half, foundry and logic should be stronger than your January expectation. Can you just talk us through what's the driver and what can be the early indication into beginning of 2019? And also, the second question is on multi-beam tools. You said that in the presentation, you already demonstrated the first 9-beam tool. And can you actually talk about what exactly can you bundle that tool with your new system so that you can have a high ASP with  existing system? Or are you going to sell that, too, as individual tool? And also, what's the potential number of beams you can bundle into the single machine? Because from my understanding, everyone in the industry has been working on a real multi-beam tool for the past 2 decades, but no one has achieved anywhere close to commercialization.\nExecutives: Okay. Now the trends foundry and logic, like we said, we have a very detailed demand planning forecast process with our customers. I would agree with you that we see foundry and logic being very strong. I don't feel that we're currently looking at a significant uptick in that strong demand. I think it's been pretty well laid out. We feel pretty happy with this also in terms of business volume. So I think it's a bit too early to -- for us to currently help you with any indication on an accelerated growth in that area. I would love to do that, but I have to rely on our own process, and our own process says it's going to be pretty healthy, that it's pretty stable. Now on the e-beam, yes, 9-beam is a prototype, so we've made the -- we captured the first images. And as we showed also in the presentation, the more beams that you have, the more servers you can actually inspect in one go. So that means the whole focus is on maximizing the potential number of beams. And the -- since that is a productivity advantage, a significant one, that also means that the value out of a tool like that will be higher than a single tool. So you could actually say that the value of the tool scales with the number of beams. And that will also -- it's too early to give you an indication of what that would mean. We'd rather discuss it with our customers first. But the potential number of beams, we're not disclosing anything yet. I mean, there are several companies working on their solutions. We'd like to keep it a little bit to our chest, but the 9 beams is just first prototype to show that multi-beam works, and we're very hard to -- we're working very hard to maximize that to the point where we have the highest value out of this type of solution. But I can tell you one thing: it's going to be significantly more than 9 beams.\nExecutives: All right. Before we sign off, I'd like to remind you that we'll be hosting an Investor Day here at our headquarters in Veldhoven on the afternoon, November 8. We hope you'll be able to join us. \nNow on behalf of ASML's board and management, I'd like to thank you all for joining us today. Operator, if you could formally conclude the call, I would appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the ASML 2018 First Quarter Financial Results Conference Call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."

         "ASML Holding N.V. - Shareholder/Analyst Call",
         "Executives: Before we open the official meeting, I have a few general announcements. First, please switch off your cell phone. Part of this meeting will be conducted in English, and we have interpreters for those who don't understand English, and they will interpret the English section. You can listen to the interpretation by the headset you received. This translation of the meeting is also available via the headphones.  Microphones are available in this room. If you would like the floor, please state your name briefly and ask keep your questions short and snappy. And I would do procedure in the meeting. I may need to curtail speaking tongue or the number of questions. \nI hereby open the ASML Holding N.V. annual general meeting, and welcome you as our shareholders.\nI'm going to introduce the members of the board of management. Mr. Wennink; Mr. [indiscernible]; and Mr. Nicole [indiscernible] seated next to me. And then Mssrs. [indiscernible]; and Schneider [indiscernible] on the front row. Also, the members of the Supervisory Board include the ladies' [indiscernible] and [indiscernible]; and the Mssrs. Grose, Schaub and [indiscernible]. Mssrs. Smits-Nusteling, Mr. [indiscernible] and Mr. [indiscernible] are to my right on the stage and I'm also pleased to welcome Mrs. Kelly, whose appointment to the Supervisory Board is an agenda item at this meeting.  I'm also pleased to welcome Mssrs. [indiscernible] and [indiscernible], whose appointment as members of the board of management of ASML will be discussed at this meeting. \nThe general meeting has been convened with due observance of ASML's Articles of Association [indiscernible] and meeting will be transmitted live via audio webcast and audio recording will be made of the meeting to draft the minutes.\nMr. Reinier Kleipool will serve as secretary to this meeting. He's a candidate civil law notary at De Brauw Blackstone Westbroek. With the details of the registration for this meeting are currently being processed before we vote, Mr. Kleipool will report how many people are present here as shareholders or proxy holders and how many votes may be cast. Mr. Kleipool will also explain the voting procedure and will perform a test run. And he will guide the voting procedure during the meeting.\nPursuant to the provisions of the corporate governance code, external auditor ASML KPMG is present today. On behalf of KPMG, we have Mr. Van Delden present. He will be able to answer questions concerning the audit report on the ASML financial statements for 2017.\nNow on to agenda item 2, which is a review of the operations, the financials and the corporate social responsibility activities of the firm. And I'm pleased to hand you over to Mr. Wennink.\nExecutives: Thank you. I'd like to review 2017 rapidly with you. Of course, you've seen the financial statements. They're not very detailed. \n2017 was an excellent year, the best year in the company's history. Revenue exceeded EUR 9 billion. So net sales grew by 33% and there was a gross margin of 45%. And that was also a record annual margin. Net income grew 44% to exceed EUR 2 billion. And our earnings per share equaled EUR 4.93, that's nearly EUR 5 per share.\nIn addition, and this is important, our share installed base services grew. Those are the services and the physical upgrade of our installed base in the field. So it grew -- that share grew by about 25% to a record EUR 2.7 billion. \nWe are the most rapidly growing section in the company aside from EUV. Now on the subject of EUV, last year, we revealed a capability of 125 wafers per hour as we indicated in the Q1 results. We had the strength of the lighting source at a level that we can generate a minimum of 125 wafers per hour. But now we're focusing on that machine's availability to minimize downtime because that machine still has some growing pains and teething troubles. But we'll talk about that and we'll work them out too, we'll resolve them.\nNow Deep UV is our bread-and-butter product. That's how we earn our daily bread. Last year, that reflected a 21% increase from 2016 and their Holistic Lithography that will touch on later on, is also pivotal in a rapidly growing company. As for 2017, that was an important year. We reached an important strategic agreement with our partner, Tran Zeiss, and -- Carl Zeiss, excuse me, and that division is -- it's a truly symbiotic relationship with our partner Carl Zeiss. And it's very important because it reinforces this strategic partnership.  And it provides a foundation for research and development procedure for the next generation of EUV machines, which will be toward the middle of the decade ahead. \nBut we received our first commissions for research and development, and those are the systems will be -- we'll start shipping those at the end of 2021 and then continuing in 2022 and what we call the early systems will start in 2023 and '24, ramping up in the next decade so that technology will take us past the end of the next decade.\nNow capital return, last year, we returned about EUR 1 billion to shareholders about half through dividends and half through share buybacks so that the number of shares in issue is declining. And given the sheer earnings ratio, it impacts the share price on the stock exchange.\nNow as for EUV, what do customers care about? They've indicated that in 2017, in Q1 2018, they've expressed confidence in EUV, and that's in this spend of next generations of advanced chips. We received 9 orders for the -- for Q1 and completed -- we've got about 36 EUV systems in our order portfolio. In 2017, we broke EUR 1 billion in sales for the first time, and we're planning about 20 systems for this year. Our capacity is 30 systems in 2019.\nNow what matters in EUV at present? Not so much the technological question as to who doesn't work. It works as proven by all the orders that our customers have placed with us. So it also means this is the new technology. But we have to make sure that teething troubles that are ongoing concerning the shelf life of certain parts, it -- we need to maximize the availability of the machines for those customers. So our target is to get availability above 90%. That concerns our Deep UV systems. And in the years ahead, we want to ensure that Deep UV machines can be used with the same -- the EUV machines need to be used with the same intensity as Deep UV machines, and that means that we are ready for industrialization. We can take the industrial and have some technical milestones from last year. \nProductivity exceeded 125 wafers per hour. We've got the pellicle, that's a membrane that we attach to the photo, negative photomask, to avoid pollution on the mask. There was a technological issue as to whether we were capable of applying such an extremely thin membrane, such an extremely thin pellicle and it all worked. And what's also important, because the EUV doesn't work in isolation, it works together with DPV systems. And if used them together, you can make chips so that the 2 technologies align in a matched overlay. And then they work together so that the positioning accuracy of it, Deep UV machine and an EUV machine, if you use 1 after the other, it's accurate to less than 1 -- 2 millionth of a millimeter. So that's very accurate usage. \nNow our product strategy, if you consider ASML 5 or 10 years ago, we did only that huge scanner in photocopying machine. But over time, we've added many new products. And you see this holistic lithography triad. We built this projection machine. But a few years ago, we started thinking about improving the process range because you need a photo negative to use it in that appropriate -- the dedicated machine. And we call that the process scope. We call that the process window. And that helps us improve the print for our customers. And it was about 15 years -- no, nearly 20 years ago when we started this. And we took the first steps. And later on, we purchased a company such as Brion that was nearly 10 years ago.\nAnd if you know what this photo negative should look like to get the optimal print, than you want to know whether it actually works that way. So you need a way to control that process window and we thought measurement systems, that's the YieldStar that was developed by ASML. And in 2016, we also purchased HMI, that's a Taiwanese company that develops inspection equipment to see whether the machine actually does what we think it does. And once you know that, then you can also use the measurement and inspection data to improve the process window. So then you bring that data back to the potential chip design and toward the machine because there are thousands of knobs on that machine to chase settings. So there's a few back loop to support customers in that increasing complexity that we see the chip industry where everything becomes tinier. And this exponentially enhances calculation, power and the storage capacity the advanced chips keeps improving, but it's also increasingly complex. So to be certain that the design will end up on the chip and that we can quickly correct any defects, we observe, it's very important to optimize the output. \nOver time, we have transitioned from building large cameras in photocopying machines to supplying process solutions. And that's what you see here in 2016, we purchased HMI. And In 2017, we had the first combined machine integrating ASML technology with the HMI technology. So we've come full circle. And the first machine shipped at the end of 2017. \nNow what does this mean? We call it a holistic lithography that should -- so not just the printer, it's knowledge about the photo negative and the photomask and the measurement and inspection equipment and how they all interact. So it's holistic vision of how customers should use the tiniest little membrane on the chip. So that means that the YieldStar machine can exist alongside the HMI machine together with a Deep UV and the EUV machine. And they interact perfectly. And this is particularly important when we head to the next generation of chips, the most advanced chip now has the smallest measurement of 10 nanometers. And you can get it from 3 to 7 to 2. \nNow who are we doing this? Of course, with our customers and with our people, our employees. One of the challenges is to keep employment up and keep the right people. \nNow if you've read the newspapers, you'll see that ASML is certainly drawing attention from qualified engineers, and our HR division processes over 1,000 applications a year. And we do have need 100,000 people. But our international contingent is increasing because there simply aren't enough people in the Netherlands. We have over 100 nationalities working in this campus in Veldhoven.  At the end of the year, we had 19,200 people and 700 people came from the HMI acquisition. But at the end of Q1 2018, we're already up to 20,200 people. So that means we've added 1,000 employees. \nHow do you find them? That's a serious challenge to Sebastian with the 10,000 working in Eindhoven. You see this in the Eindhoven Daily. So that half people -- half the work in Veldhoven, and the other half work abroad. Divide that equally between Asia and the United States. \nNow let's talk about the financials. Also meant those because we are going to talk about the financial statements. As I said, 33% growth in net sales in 2017, what we call base management. So that's tending to the machines in the field, not just servicing them but also upgrading them to the next generation. Well, that's going at pace from 1.1 million to nearly 2.7 million. From EUR 2.1 billion to nearly EUR 2.7 billion. And we see that in absolute terms, we still have excellent revenues. But in the memory chips, we see a lot of growth in that market. \nThe market has nearly doubled and that growth is continuing. We all deal with that. And you, your children and your grandchildren will all be using the cloud. You already use it. So there are a great many data solutions and software solutions that are no longer on your PC or your tablet, no. They're basically driven and managed and processed in the cloud through huge data centers. And that means that the huge data supply needs to be processed very quickly. So demand for what we call high-power computing. \nSo systems where the chips have a fantastic computational power, that needs to be nurtured and supported by a very powerful operating memory and storage capacity because all those data need to be stored in the cloud that we want to obtain it from later on. So you need to see the cloud applications in terms of artificial intelligence, self driving cars, virtual reality, and the traditional communication through a smartphone, more PC. Everything is driven by that cloud. So that means that means that the sophisticated powerful computation chips are not possible unless they're supported by very powerful memory chips. \nSo whereas in the past the memory chips market was not growing very quickly with the advance of the cloud. You see a massive rise in these sophisticated memory chips. You saw that in 2017 and its continuing in 2018.\nNow as for the figures, 33% top line growth, 45% gross earnings margin. That's good. And this margin takes into account that we're not really making a lot of money and EUV yet in 2017. It's even slightly negative. And of course, that depresses the gross earnings margin. But we went from -- it went from EUR 300 million to EUR 1.1 billion at a low margin, but we managed to increase that margin because the rest of the company is operating more efficiently. \nAs for the EUV margin, we are fully confident as we indicated that by 2020, it will be between 35% and 40%. 40% is a nice target, and it's a viable target. Why? Because the EUV systems, if you look outside, you see a huge factory. And last year only few systems came from that factory. But we can about 45 systems from them. So you can compute those fixed costs. If you have 12 systems, then the fixed -- the overhead is very high. But if you have 45, you'll have a much lower overhead. \nIn addition, by 2020, we'll have a learning curve so we'll be cutting costs. And that will also manifest. We have other more productive EUV systems, so they're more valuable. That's the third reason. And keep in mind, we have service organization, very complex machines that require dozens of people to service it.\nAnd then there's infrastructure that we need to assemble in the field. We're incurring those costs now. And the warranty period on those machines is still pending. But by 2020, they'll no longer be covered by the warranty. So if you add all of this, there's little doubt that by 2020, we'll have a margin between 35% and 40%. And compared with the projected margin for the company as a whole, that will exceed 50%.\nNow net result, one more point, R&D costs, they increased by EUR 160 million. And we envisage that same increase in 2018 when we head to the next EUV generation. First, we'll spend on R&D both at ASML and ZEISS, which we largely finance. So that will keep rising. But the top line for 2018 will be up as well due to the reasons I just told you about.\nNet income is up 44% to -- it exceeds EUR 2 billion as I mentioned, nearly EUR 5 per share in earnings.  Bookings value was over EUR 9 billion last year at the end of Q1. I'm sure that you can do the numbers yourself, at nearly EUR 7 billion for order portfolio at the end of Q1. So things are looking good in this company. \nNow as for cash flow, what are we doing with those earnings? At present, we have what we call free cash flow that's after all the investments and suddenly the financing transactions and after we invest the cash from earnings into working capital, we have about 7% of the net earnings. That's not where we want to be, we'd like a bit more. But that's the way things are because we're accumulating working capital for the EUV ramp. That's going to cost a lot of money. And in 2017 we invested EUR 1 billion in our Carl Zeiss venture. \nAnd working with the balance sheet, we see equity method investments. As said, that's nearly EUR 1 billion that's Carl Zeiss. It's well-financed solvent, very solvent company. So we can fund that growth and cover the R&D expenses and make the necessary investments to grow that company further. \nNow as for the shareholders, last year, about EUR 1 billion was returned to the shareholders. About 0.5 million was paid in dividend -- excuse me, EUR 0.5 billion was paid in dividend and EUR 0.5 billion was paid in shares. But we had to wait until we made that payment to ZEISS. And after we did that, we resumed the share buyback. We proposed increasing the dividend to EUR 1.40. We'll talk about that later on. \nWe've also announced new share buyback program to the tune of EUR 2.5 billion, of which the first buyback was achieved in Q1 2018 and that will continue in the quarters ahead. \nNow I'll briefly result -- I'll briefly summarize the Q1 results. The Q1 was fine, it was just above the market guidance we had set to -- we achieved EUR 2.2 billion. The gross margin was high because we booked little EUV sales in Q1. In Q2, we expect more. And the operating margin was 28%. That was looking good. And quite a good order intake to the tune of EUR 2.4 billion. \nNow outlook for Q2, we see that net sales are expected to increase to EUR 2.5 billion to EUR 2.6 billion comprising EUR 600 million for EUV. That's considerably more than in Q1 at a lower margin. The margin is in the black, but it's not the same as the Deep UV margin, and it certainly impacts gross earnings. But that will settle up in the rest of the year. So we're not worried about the gross earnings percentage for 2018. We'll get there. \nR&D costs will rise a bit because we had those next generation orders. Those systems will cost EUR 270 million each. We've received 4 orders and we purchased 8 options on early volume systems. Or yielding a potential EUR 1.5 billion cash flow. If you receive the money in the bank, that's great, but you have to work to get there. So that's why our R&D costs will take us to the next level. We're both in Veldhoven and in Germany at Carl Zeiss. We'll make our first investments.\nNow here's my last slide. Corporate governance code from 2016 was implemented as of 1 January, 2017. We are entirely compliant with this code. In our view, we performed a complete review of our corporate governance structure, not only the structure, also the internal processes. And we reviewed the agreements that we reached about rules for the board of management in the Supervisory Board. We've amended those to comply with the new corporate governance, legislation. And as you would expect from us, we're particularly focused on being in compliance with the applicable rules of good corporate governance. \nAnd I'd like to wrap up on this note. Gerhard will move on to the next item.\nExecutives: Fine, which brings me to you people who are here in the room. You may have some questions. And I see that Mr. Stevens has raised his hand.\nExecutives: And let's go to Mike to Mr. Stevens. All the way from the back of.\nAttendees: That this misses [indiscernible] he is with the Association to protect the rights of shareholders. You've said quite a few things already about the cash flow, about results. We have a different computational method these days, and through that method, we find out that your capacity to earn back the money is quite weak. And we looked into this a bit further, and we found out what you already said, too. The new machines have a lower profit margin. And then if we look at the market, at the market for chips, and we see that there is a lower demand for smartphones, there are more chips for crypto and for artificial intelligence, supercomputers, the Internet of Things. Okay, if we look even deeper than this, we see that in the next generation machines coming up and possibly the next decade, but if you have a lower profit margin, if that is reduced, you will have to get the money to develop the new machines from the cash flow. And we'd like you to tell us a little bit more about this. Let's explain that a little bit further, please. And something else that we noted, the intangible assets, that is 60% approximately of the book value, which we feel, well, that's quite a bit, isn't it? And then let's continue with something else that you mentioned, the 80% you mentioned. Could this harm the company? Because there is less faith in the company. How do you manage this? It is not quite clear what Mr. Stevens means by the 18%. You said it's okay but that is what you say. But what does the market think? Legal disputes at the level of which you operate. You will have those legal disputes, of course. And they will be lengthy ones, no doubt. But we ask you to tell us a little bit more about the dispute that you have at ZEISS, you and ZEISS with Nikon. That has been ongoing for a while. And for us, outside this, we just read a little bit about this and then hear a little bit about this, but it is very hard for us with a little bit of knowledge to assess how that is going. \nNationalities, you mentioned the number of nationalities of the employees. Well, you have mentioned that. And then maybe people do not understand one another, all those nationalities. Do you have particular people that you employ who are designated to make sure that everybody understands everything, that people work well together and that there is no conflict between people who work here? These are our questions for the time being. Thank you.\nExecutives: Thank you.\nExecutives: Thank you will talk.\nExecutives: Thank you, and Mr. Wennink is going to answer the questions and.\nExecutives: Mr. Stevens, thank you so much for the context of the market. But you've already said it. I said it. We have no concerns about the market nor the market growth. Smartphones have shown single-digit growth in the past couple of years. The double figure growth of smartphones was years ago. But it's not just the smartphones, mind you. It is also the Internet, the cloud, the cryptocurrencies, the artificial intelligence, the autonomous cars. It's all of that. It is to that window of the advanced chips, that scope, that range is becoming broader. So the demand is also increasing. And you will not be surprised to know that we have very good expectations for the growth of that potential of this company. And we have no worries to be able to earn back the investment as you will have seen and have seen in the past years. It will not stop at 2017. The profit margins of the new machines, okay, good question. You want to know more about this? I already indicated that profit margins, how we wish to get those at the required levels for the current machines. And the new machines, yes, as you said, much will have to be invested in that. But we no longer have to invest in the EUV light source. The light source was our problem. That used to be a problem but we will use the same light source. By mid-next decade, we'll have a much higher reliability than we have now. Because we have in addition to which we have agreements with Carl Zeiss, as mentioned. A part of their capital goods are funded quite a big part of that. And we will get that money back. We'll get them back because we consider these 2 companies 1 business which means that we have agreed that we are entitled to a certain return on our investments, and that return will be paid back through a lower price that we have to pay for the lenses. So for the next-generation EUV lenses, when we get those, we'll have huge mark down as a result of our investments. So the profit margins for the new machines will be considerably better initially than those for the current EUV. So the light source is the result -- is the reason for that because we've learned and the lens price will have been adapted because of that requirement over return on our investments. So I do believe that the cash flow, free cash flow will be able to finance of this, especially because our market is growing, and we have no doubt, nor do our clients have any doubt, because of course there is reason why they've already placed the orders that they have placed. They have good faith in us. There is EUR 1.5 billion on their way from their bank accounts to ours. So they must have some faith. Yes, the immaterial assets, 60% you mentioned, yes, true, it is 60%. And it has to come from our own equity and then you have the corrections on both sides of the balance sheet. So there's sufficient solvency, no worries. Availability of the machines, that is quite right. The Deep UV machine does work technically. It's not being industrialized yet. A lot of work has to be done yet because of the shelf life of the elements, the parts that we use it for a long time. Will it still have the same quality, and we have that learning curve all the time. It all transitions. We have a very detailed plan. The -- to get the availability of the machine up from the 80% you mentioned to 90%. So we have a lot of projects that are concurrent. Thousands of people are working on that. In addition to our client because, of course, the client wants to use this as much as possible. So the 80% availability, we know where we stand, we know where we wish to stand. Especially in the past couple of months, the last most recent quarter, there were some breakthroughs regarding to the reliability of the EUV light source. We had some concerns on the mirror that catches the light, whether the shelf life would be such that it would be attractive for customers. But as I said, we have quite a few breakthroughs, and we have all faced that we can have a 90-plus percent availability. \nNext, the legal disputes that you mentioned, that has already been explained before in the financial statements. It is not uncommon, as you said, in our industry to have this type of dispute. We had Qualcomm and Apple and Samsung, and of course, tens or dozens of thousands of patents are filed by these major companies. And of course, after a while, people don't quite agree or companies don't quite agree. And these are very lengthy proceedings on very complex technology. Yes, and there is litigation and we would explain to the court that we are not worried about the validity of our patents, that they are ours, that they are unique. And we had [indiscernible] at all. And of course, we have to wait and see whether the court agrees with our point of view. We do feel, of course, that the court will agree, but we'll have to wait and see. We cannot say anything else. I haven't got a crystal ball. I cannot tell you what will happen in the future. Then all those nationalities in our company. Yes, quite a valid commentary. They have to work together. Even though they come from all corners of the world. So 80% or 85% of our staff are university-educated. And especially people who work in that field and who come from universities from across the world. They mainly speak english. Sometimes I have meetings, lunches with new staff members who join us, and  their command of the English language is very good. They have excellent command of the english language. So we speak mainly english in this company. That that is the common language that we use. And it's not so much the language that is the issue, but the way of working. So we have special programs to make sure that the new hires are given a buddy, a buddy who shows them what the procedures are, what the system is, give them explanation on what is expected from the new hires. There is transparency about the type of work they have to do and how this contributes to the work that others do. We pay a lot of attention to this. You are quite right if you don't do this, people just run around not knowing where to go. So that does have our special attention. And in the meeting that we had with the Supervisory Board, it was discussed at length, too. So yes. So my point. Thank you. There's a lot of attention for this.\nExecutives: Thank you. Anyone else? On the left-hand side here.\nAttendees: [indiscernible] is my name. My compliments for your results and also for the annual report. I have some minor questions. First of all, the transition to 7 nanometers and beyond, do you agree, sir, that the total market worldwide, I think it is from 35 billion up to maybe 50 billion, and I hear reports on the intensity. They feel that at this higher than the lithography intensity of this market. But I'd like your opinion on this, sir. And the second question is something that you already mentioned. In 10 to 12 years, there's a transition to 2 nanometers. And then we get to the post optics era. I do not know whether you're already doing any R&D into the post optics era, but what I want to ask is what do you think of the long-term outlook with regards to those post optics. \nGross margin, 49% in Q1. So that's a wonderful result. So not just for the model tools but for the old-fashioned tools. So high 40s, low 50s. When do you expect those for the EUV? And the final question is the innovation box. For taxes, the fiscal, how do you see the development regarding that, the taxes that need to be paid in the future? Those are my 4 questions.\nExecutives: Okay, the questions will be answered, 3 and 4 by Wolfgang. I will answer 1 and somebody else will answer question 2. The world [indiscernible] fab equipment market to make the chips, yes, indeed, some 50 billion, quite a considerable growth. Do bear in mind that the sales of our top line clients also had turbulent growth. And we are in a period if you look at the market in which we operate, and we have to subdivide this into 3 segments. The logics, the memory chips, which is -- which supports the logic, DRAM and the NAND chips, the storage chips for storage of data. Those 3, you have to break it down into these 3.  And all 3 submarkets are hot, which has to do with the cloud, the Internet of Things, those developments. But if you look at the third segments, the NAND, the storage chips so to speak, we progress to a new technology. The number of bits on those is determined by the number of layers. And those layers for that [indiscernible] position, you need etching. And every layer has their position step and an etching step, which means so that you have to have the pattern, you need lithography part. But storage chips is -- we have some colleagues in that market. Relatively speaking, they benefit a lot from that market. So that litho intensity as a percentage of the total CapEx, which is our money spent on this equipment, decreases. It goes down. But in absolute terms, lithography does not go down. Because if you go to all -- to the multilayer strategy, you need more position, you need more etch. So that's good for our colleagues. And DRAM and in logic, it's a different situation because in those 2 segments, we have to deal with -- we have very complex designs, especially in logics. Layer very complex layer of the chipset, sometimes 3, 4, 5, 6 [indiscernible] has to go through the machines just for 1 layer and EUV makes this very simply. We can just do it in 1 step. But if you have to do it 5 to 6 times, then you also have to have the 5 to 6 times deposition layer, etching layer. So good for our colleagues once more. But if we reduce those 5 to 6 layers to 1 and we do it through EUV machine, which is double the price, then the relative share of the EUV machine or if the lithography goes up as a part of the total costs and our colleagues [indiscernible]. So you see the opposite happen, not just for logic but also for DRAM. So what you have to do, you have to look at those market segments and in certain segments of the market, litho intensity increases and then in the other markets, there is a relatively -- a relative downturn. But overall, because DRAM and logic is the bigger part of the market, the litho intensity will increase. Thank you.\nExecutives: The post optics well, I'm very happy with the HMI orders. I'm very happy with those. So the bandwidth is different. I am -- I will function or operate until the next decade. You talk about 2 nanometers. Where do we stand today? If you buy an advanced Apple phone, there are 10 nanometers chips in there. And which the new technology we feel that it is usable at 1 nanometer. Now we may speculate 10 years ahead. What could happen after 1 nanometer? But there are lots of questions. So let me not go into that right now. We are now into expanding the current EUV machines. And in the short term, as Peter says, it will simplify the processing. And that will be soon 5 to 3 nanometers. And there'll be a situation in which we will have various exposures, double patterning, which will result in more process steps, higher costs [indiscernible] through the HMA, it will go down, and there will be a new situation. And what happens after, well, I can't really tell you yet. Maybe we can talk about this some time in the near future. But what is important after the next decade is the number of layers, the number of exposures that is required will have the imaging done with the lower resolution and we'll have to have a higher throughput. Those are the main things for the next decade. And this should be right together with some processing tricks to get up to the required nanometer level. Costs, Wolfgang, EUV margin tax burden, the innovation box.\nExecutives: The gross margin and innovation box as well. Gross margin a repeat part part of what Peter already said. There is a big difference between our EV business currently, although we make great progress year-over-year and the rest of our business. So in a given quarter, you can have quite some churn. Like for instance, in Q2, we'll ship -- we'll have almost 4x the revenue in EUV and then we have in Q1 and you can see we've gone from 49% almost 49% to 43%. That will level itself out throughout the year. We said publicly that this year, although we haven't given a specific number, that the overall company gross margin will progress from the 45% that we achieved last year despite the fact that the EUV business is doubling in size again. So that, of course, shows that we're making progress in EUV. And we talk a lot about EUV, but we also continue to create a lot of value in the non-EUV business. But it's often forgotten that half of our R&D budget goes to non-EUV products, Deep UV, Holistic Lithography and so forth. And we continue to create value there and we share that with the customer. But we have the opportunity to increase the margins there as well. We spelled out quite specifically, and Peter mentioned that the 4 criteria, volume, cost, mix in the service business, how we get in the ZIP code of 40% gross margin by 2020, I think it's very feasible. If we achieve the volumes and the tool does what it's supposed to do, it's very feasible. And that will enable us as a company to cross the 50% mark, which is our milestone for 2020. Beyond 2020, we have never said that we stop at 40% for EUV. We'll continue to make the tool better. We'll have more throughput. There will be newer versions of the tool. And then I think we also said that the inherent gross margin of high-NA by its value proposition is potentially higher than what the pre-high-NA EUV does. So we're pretty comfortable that we can continue to increase the gross margin of the company over the next couple of years. \nNow as it relates to the innovation box, many governments in the world do have tax systems that support innovation because from an economic standpoint, that is what drives growth in those countries. It's not just the Netherlands. There's also tax credits, research tax credits in the U.S., for instance, as you know. The innovation box has been adjusted last year, also based on OECD rules. So the Netherlands has also adjusted the innovation box. And we're happy that we qualified again for the innovation box. Just as a reminder, ASML declares about more than 80% of our profits in the Netherlands, and it's clearly viewed as a win-win, what we do here because for [indiscernible], we have at ASML, we believe there are 3 to 4 jobs in the supply chain. Universities prosper, there's lots of incremental growth for society. We got it prolonged the conditions for those of you who are in the details have adjusted a little bit. So the advantageous tax rate is 2% higher than it used to be, but it's still advantageous. And we were able to get an agreement for 7 years. And that is supporting us with our overall model where we think in the 2020 timeframe, we'll continue to be at about a 14% tax rate for the company. So we're quite pleased with that situation.\nExecutives: Thank you, Wolfgang. Let me move up [indiscernible]. Mr. [indiscernible]?\nAttendees: Thank you, chair. My name is [indiscernible] on behalf of the association of stockholders in the Netherlands chair. It seems as if the trees grow up as far as heaven. They reach the sky and the sky is the limit. And you wonder about disruptive developments. And Mr. [indiscernible], may have seemed to have pointed it out already after the 1 nanometer. But if you live here locally, you hear from the [indiscernible] and enter the technical university. You hear about the photonic chip that they are developing, and the photonic chips is through light. And it is the processing of the major data, the big data. And Internet with the major data centers you already mentioned the cloud. We need a lot. And with those photons that responded differently than electrons, especially with respect to light, they would be faster, less energy. They could even be sensors. So the machines that you have, can these machines really supply the industry for when the photonic chips are going to be made. So if that day comes, will the machines, the EUV and the high EUV, will they be able to handle this? That is my first topic. And then two, you are way ahead of the competition, way, way ahead. And with the current knowledge that you have and the range of machines, you are 100% monopolist, the high-end pricing power. How can you use that in EUV? You said you get to discount the markdown at Carl Zeiss. Do you also give discounts to those major partners of yours, Samsung, TSMC, Intel? Do they get a discount on the EUV machines or do you take things easy and by 2020 you think, we'll get the profit then? So the pricing power of the EUV machines, things go very fast. You do not want to have any wasted assets, and you of course, want to get a return on your development investments. And then I have another question. The role of diminishing returns is we see that. The machines become more complex. They cost a lot of money. They become more and more expensive. And there could be less demand. It's not for a mass-market of course, that consideration. Is that something that you talk about or are you just going to wait and see what will happen? That is maybe something that you can't tell. Mr. Nichol, the CFO, likes risks, but controlled risks, I understand. So I'm quite curious to know as to your risks. The production capacity, you do not say, no, we haven't got it. But you say I've got a delay. It's later, but later could be counterproductive. You invested in Carl Zeiss, you bought some companies. Is it possible the production goes up to 40? Can it be higher than that? Or that not something that the market requires? And then my final question for now, in the past 2 to 3 weeks, we've had a bit of a fright regarding so what we hear about the chips industry. You say those analysts, all nonsense because the chip cyclists [indiscernible] haven't got those anymore forget that. And some companies have to give a profit warning. I saw Mr. [indiscernible], or it was TSMC with the profit warning and [indiscernible] said don't worry, things are fine. But still, you hear these things and then you hear that the chip industry is past its zenith. Can I sleep quietly tonight?\nExecutives: Well, you shouldn. You should sleep without any worries. Okay, we see that there's disruption throughout the room. Now following up on what I said about post optics, I think it will remain optical even after 1 nanometer. As for photonic chips, I think that our customer is thinking about different types of technologies not only photonic chips. We're also talking about quantum computing, different computer architectures. So we see that customers are looking for different architectures to boost their system performance. We believe that whatever the technology becomes, it will always reasons. It will always include miniaturizing the connections. Secondary is how those connections are made. What matters to that in all cases, you need to apply those connections photographically. That's our stock in trade. We want to do things as small as possible not only in dimensions. We also want to maximize accuracy, and we want to do so as quickly as possible. We believe this is generic for any technology, and the innovation that you mention as well as other innovations will ultimately benefit total volume and total lithography demand. So we don't believe that -- we don't believe it's possible to make these advanced chips in large volumes without involving lithography. And of course, our capital price will need the right material. But we'll keep at it. Now I have 1 comment about the next questions related to this and after that, we'll discuss the finances. You asked about the value of boosted performance. You mentioned the 270 million High-NA and that's quite curious winning those High-NA orders. And charging that price is not just because of our pricing power that we can also rationalize but they performance improvement of the machine, the productivity and has increased the value such that the prices rationalized. And the technology isn't so complex that we need a bigger coverage to ensure the margin. And the question is also is the machine worth the technology  And we have to work all that out before we develop the machines. And if we are developing such a large machine, we need to know that the machine is worth it so that we won't machine is there. And that's the value of the orders from the customers and a hand you over to my other board members now.\nExecutives: Accident, Martin. the so wonderful ran up to ask questions question pricing power and law of diminishing returns. Martin expanded very clearly. The way this is how we've always done the pricing when I joined ASML, the most expensive machine was EUR 5 billion. We just sold the machine for EUR 270 million and the customer is still buying it. , and this is because of Moore's law, because Moore's law is in. Law of economics. You have thought cost per function every few years. So the cost per function or transistor 20 years ago when I arrived, the machine that EUR 5 million, those costs were considerably higher than what the customer calculates as cost per transistor for the EUR 270 million machine that will be operational in 2025. That's an exponential reduction in costs, and that's exactly the cost of the machine. If you use of logarithmic scale to calculate the cost reduction, if we can calculate what lithography adds to those costs and he would say that, that cost reduction half will borne by ASML and half by the customer, that's always been our principle. And basically, we've been able to increase the price from EUR 5 million to EUR 270 million, and we still sell. It's true that if fewer machines are sold, but that's simply because the transistor density because of the continuous miniaturization, the density is increasing exponentially as is the productivity of as a machine. So you don't need as many machine, but each machine becomes far more expensive. So that's the ASML top line. As for discounts, we sell the current EUV machine at 100% capacity. It's not yielding that yet, so you can say customers are getting a discount. But the way we put that pricing together relates to sharing the cost benefit. And we've always priced that way and we'll continue doing that in the future as for the question about production capacity. Now it's 40 to 45 systems, which will continue in the different chains. We'll reduce throughput time in the factory as much as possible, because if we can use the same square meters, you can build more machines if you accelerate throughput times. So this is the most economic approach. If we need higher numbers, let's say, we need 60, then we'll need to increase production capacity. I'm talking in terms of square meters. That's not relevant yet, but it depends on how successful we are and how many more EUV machines we need to build. We need that runup time of 2, 2.5 years to increase capacity levels. And and once we get there, we'll have the prospect for higher sales. Now the last question is an update on the check industry. Despite what my predecessor said, I'm not going to say that there are no cycles in the semiconductor industry and that's logical. I'll give you one example of the different segments. The DRAM segment for the memory chips, there are 3 suppliers for that. A better example. Look at the mem chips. Those are the storage chips, they're faster that's 5 suppliers for those Intel, Toshiba, Samsung, Hynix and Micron. If each of them are sized to build a new factory at the same time, those are huge factories that cost between $5 billion and and $8 billion each. And let's say that they are all competed at the same point, then you can't get a step of a huge increase in capacity. Now the bit demand increases by 40% to 50% a year, so you'll grow quickly there. But temporarily in the short term, it may lead to surplus capacity and the market will react to that. But as for the medium and long term and the TSMC story, it's not adjusted the smartphones, but the high-power computer chips that go to the server parts of the data centers and that they continue powering the cloud. That demand is ongoing. And as for TSMC, we are investing more in our 7- and 5-nanometer machines. Why are they doing that? Because if you look at the Apples and the Oracles in this world, there has a huge window. There vast number of applications for that chip. So in the medium term, we can invest more because we envisage growth. So that's justified. Whether you have a short-term view or medium to long-term, the short-term view will focus on temporary surplus capacity in a certain segment, or in the medium term, they shouldn't need to worry about that.\nAttendees: Executives and Non-Executive Representatives and of course, also all other ASML employees. My name is Denise, and I represent the and him from [indiscernible], or in English and Dutch association of investors for sustainable development. We consist of 60 institutional and over 600 private investors who support our aim to make the Dutch capital market more sustainable. And for many years now, we have been visiting ASML's AGMs as an opportunity to point to diverse stakeholder groups your sustainability achievements made over the past year, but also of course as a possibility to further drive corporate sustainability implementation within ASML in our [indiscernible] share and stakeholder. So I have 2 questions. But before that, may we -- let me make a small remark that we were a bit surprised about relatively short item of sustainability on the agenda. Maybe, we're going to hear more about implementation of the code but we were hoping to also see other topics addressed this year. The question that I have regards 2 topics. One is energy consumption and the other one is the payment of a living wage and the supply chain. ASML has a 10% energy savings target for 2020 taking 2015 as a reference year. And we've seen that in 2017, savings that -- and '16, a saving of 35.1 and 48.8 terajoule has been achieved. But on the other hand, on Page 174 of the annual report of this year, we find that energy consumption regarding your own operations has increased and also significantly compared to 2015 levels. So since 2020 is not so far away, we are wondering how sure is ASML to actually meet this target of absolute reduction compared to 2015 levels also given the growth that we're seeing currently. In the report that we can read that you are being on track which is not the same confident formulation that we have also -- regarding some other items today. So we were wondering how will you assure to meet this target. And also, have you already looked into your energy targets beyond 2020? And regarding the living wage, I would first like to compliment you because you've made an explicit reference in the annual report that you support this concept. And we would like to see that. We understand that within ASML directly and luckily, living wages are not an issue and probably also not in the first supply chain tier with suppliers such as Carl Zeiss. However, we think that looking at the wider supply chain, this might well be an under addressed issue. And as ASML has repeatedly recognized its responsibility when it comes to deeper supply chains. For example, with the conflict pre-mineral initiative engagement, we are wondering how informed is ASML regarding payment of a living wage deeper in the supply chain? For instance, when it comes to this initiative are also beyond. And do you see a role for yourself in further driving this point on the agenda, for instance, in the former EICC or through owned initiatives such as an inclusion of this as a requirement in your supplier Code of Conduct.\nExecutives: Okay, there's some many, many questions of 2 main questions or there's a lot of sub-questions, yes. I think first on the 2015, or let's say, the 2020 target with reference to 2015, you're absolutely correct. The 10% is our target. But I have to say that you are correct in an absolute terms, our energy usage will go up for the simple reason that the EUV machines will actually need more energy and then because the number of EUV will actually grow, and we need to test them and they actually take a lot of energy. That's inherent and that in the design of it because we use high-power CO2 lasers to regenerate EUV light which where the conversion efficiency is, let's say, that is undeniably low, and there is some physical limitations of how much you can drive that conversion efficiency up. Now I have to say that EUV machines are very important for the total ecosystem because by shrinking the transistors on the chip, the energy usage of the chip will go down significantly. And as you know, I'm pretty sure that as you know, that when you look at the advanced data centers, there are enormous users of energy. So more advanced chips while actually drive the energy consumption down but you need, unfortunately, an EUV system for it that initially needs a high energy input. But I think the equation, from a broader perspective, gives a very positive our business case, you could say, on the use of EUV systems and for it to shrink. Now that doesn't mean that we need to lowering the energy usage of the systems, which will be part of the further designs of those tools. So it will be a further reduction of the energy usage or the, let's say, the conversion efficiency driving that up. Now having said that, it was inevitable that we will, with the growth of the EUV business, start to using in absolute terms more energy, we are focusing on reaching our target of 100% renewable energy by 2020. And currently, we're at 72%. Now how do we do that? We are sourcing this through the guarantee of origin projects, where we make sure that we buy the renewable energy, those labels are actually there. Yes? So why we cannot avoid is a higher usage, the focus on renewable energies and also the funding of what we call the guarantee of origin projects which we do, yes, will enable us to at least have a significant contribution to this issue. And the targets beyond 2020. Yes, we are formulating currently targets beyond 2020. It has to do with the fact that we are really looking at the focus areas of our sustainable strategy as defined by the United Nations framework whereby basically as we are looking at what are the most relevant items are of that framework as to -- as it relates to the ASML strategy. And that will determine, and it's probably going back to 9 to 5 focused areas where we are currently defining the 2025 strategic targets. And when we think about this and the SDGs of the United Nations, the sustainable development goals that have been formulated, I think we're basically focusing or we're very likely to focus on the 5 most important one. And I think a quality of education whereby people development and training is extremely important. We furthermore have what we call the decent work and economic growth in our goal, which is the co-development with the suppliers. It actually relates to your second question. And we have to make sure that all our suppliers, and we are making sure that all our suppliers are part of the responsible business alliance and have signed that code. Industry and innovation as a third -- as a third SDG whereby industry innovation and the way that we innovate is very much driven by our open innovation concept, which is very difficult to ASML whereby for instance, our R&D charge, which this year is significantly over the -- close to [ EUR 1.3 billion ] of last year's is shared in the supply chain about 45% of our R&D is not with ASML. It's with our partners in our suppliers. SDG 12 was about the responsible consumption and production. We focused very much on the circular economy. Now we have or close to 100%, over 99% of our parts -- sorry? 99% of our parts are actually recirculated. Our tools in the field, we have special upgrade programs to make sure that they are not decommissioned and that they're actually reused and they're upgraded to the next level of performance. And on the climate action, we talked about it. This is about it energy efficiency by the products, about the conversion efficiency focus we have in EUV. And I think, making sure that the electricity that we use is 100% renewable. And also, out of 5 -- I think the 5 core areas of focus that we will put into our sustainable strategy going forward. And that will lead to 2025 targets that we will share with you in our next integrated report. We need to define those targets as a board, and we need to agree with them with our senior management group, but that will be the result of the work we will do this year. On your question of the living wages, I will come back to what I said earlier. It's one of the target areas of the SDG focus that we will have going forward. It is very much part of our focus on our supply chain and where we do our supplier audits. The supplier audits involve not only quality logistic technology and cost but also the fifth element which is called sustainability, and we require that our suppliers are part and have underwritten the code of the responsible business alliance, which of course needs to support the whole constant of the living wage. Now I ask a question about how deep the inside go into the supply chain. It doesn't stop at Tier 1. It very often goes down to tiers 2 and 3 and even 4. it depends a little bit on what we are buying. But what we are buying generally is technology that is developed and manufactured in countries that are subscribing to the sustainable development goals and actually companies that are public companies and are written those goals. So for our suppliers, it is a requirement to underwrite those -- the responsible business alliance code papers, but it is not of a major issue for it because it is very often part of their sustainable strategy already. So we happen to have a supply chain that doesn't operate in areas where living wage is a real issue. That is an advantage of this company, but also we make sure that our suppliers live up to the code.\nExecutives: Thank you, Peter. The next question?\nAttendees: I'm Terry [indiscernible]. I'd also like to compliment you on those figures. It's great that you manage to sustain those year-after-year. I was wondering in recent months. Of course, ASML learns from technological breakthroughs in physics, chemistry and mathematics. And can you tell me about other factors? Do you [indiscernible] in accelerations related to embedded software because I imagine there are millions of codes in those machines. So in other words, is that -- is the problem kind of relate to physics or the chemistry or is it -- does the problem also related to computer science? I think that Mr. van den Brink is the best person to answer that but I do note that the EUV machines has 51 million lines of code, so that's quite a challenge.\nExecutives: Martin?\nExecutives: I would like to say that building machines comprises many different disciplines not just physics. I would say that straightforward machine building involves many different elements and an even more software than the 50 million lines of codes. But what we've been working on in recent years is that expanding to greater automation and Mr. Fanning show you our holistic Triad in lithography with machines at the top and computational lithography at the bottom and other computational features. So in California and in China, there are software developments that make it possible to stimulate chip production and that's not involve extremely sophisticated software and that simulation is to be calculated. We use self learning algorithms for that, that can optimize the entire process. So we see a growing role for software but it's not -- it's the integration between software and the hardware. They need to be aligned. I'd almost say that that's a secret of our technology. We have another question at the left there.\nAttendees: Mr. Chairman, I'm [indiscernible] from Amsterdam. I have a question based on the annual report. It is very readable, but I still have a few questions that the message of the CEO. Because you're right that there's increasing scope of application for semiconductors. That's true. And you mentioned that you -- that wonderful products may require good employees and ASML depends on them. That's also true. But then, in the Dutch financial daily on 21 of April 2018, there was a remuneration especially short a button who explained that to some extent, money is secondary, it's the 9 financial aspects that carried the most weight in considering job changes. Then, I look on your website, and I see a vast number of vacancies. I'm not sure why you didn't find candidates for them. Is it because of the non-financial aspects? And this ASML you're aiming to achieve more smaller, more powerful and more energy-efficient and more cost-efficient too. But I'm wondering is why are there so many unfilled vacancies in your company? Is it because of the people in the organization? I'd like to base off with you about that. Perhaps, do you need to offer some nonfinancial incentives. I'd like you to tell me more about that. And of course, this morning, I read the Dutch financial daily and that was quite a shot because Mr. Nicholas is leaving. Couldn't you retain him for the nonfinancials. I thought that was [indiscernible]. But then I read on, and you also have the most patents because of your technology, and there are at least 2 people in your organization who are being considered for a wonderful award. So that's good news. But I think it said that Mr. Nicholas is leaving. Okay. Duly noted. We agree but we found an excellent success in Mr. Dressel will tell you more about later on. I'm not there yet, but I'd certainly like you to tell me who is in charge of nonfinancial aspects.\nExecutives: Okay, first Mr. Wennink will talk about the code of ASML, the contingent of employees and our place in filling vacancies.\nExecutives: Unfilled vacancies. This is mainly to do with the fact of timing because at the moment, says Mr. Wennink, we have an annual run rate as we call it. So the vacancies in the past 12 months, actually, I should say the job applicants, more than 100,000, but we only need a couple of thousands. So we have to be very selective. Yes, we need people but we need to right people. And then financial partners only a very small part, you're quite right. And of course, we pay good wages. No doubt about that. We pay well. But people in Silicon Valley, they come to ASML because they've had it to make emoticons for WhatsApp. So they'd rather make algorithms complex machines such as remake. And maybe they've entered into the Plaza and that is a great place for all those hundreds of -- more than 100 nationalities to meet those people. So it's not just how much you earn but also what you get, what you experience. And we have a very low churn rate. People stay because it's not just the financial reward. It is what they do with whom they work. What the company is like, and yes, we still have a lot of vacancies because it takes about 3 to 4 months before you find the right people. So we always have some vacancies. There will always be some vacancies. Will never have every spot filled but our HR department is convinced that with those major influx of people that apply for jobs because apparently, we have a very good reputation as an employer so there's not going to be any trouble to fill the vacancies that we wish to fill. We will be able to do that.\nExecutives: Thank you, Peter. So the nonfinancial benefits of ASML are quite good, [indiscernible] benefits. And Mr. [indiscernible] without use of the mic so he's not quite audible to be interpreted. Okay, that is not a problem. The average age is very stable. We have a lot of new hires from universities. So they make sure that the average age is a bit lower than the average age that you see here behind this desk. We're a bit older than the average employees.\nAttendees: The next question, I read in the past couple of weeks that China has an emphasis for the next 10 to 20 years of the production of chips. My question to you, which is an inevitable question I feel, how do you view the development. And what is your position in this? And my second question is I hear that you develop software in China, and what about the intellectual property rights of ASML and the parties in China that you work with? By the way, that last piece is not right.\nExecutives: No? Says Mr. Wennink. That's not right, Sir. There is a condition.\nAttendees: So disregard this because that's not the situation. So China, how do we view China?\nExecutives: Quite evident, I could say. I think that as indicated in the 5-year plan, they are going from being the sweat shop of the world to top-end value-adding, and it's been made very clear that the semiconductor industry and the chip industry is essential in this. They will invest some 200 billion in the local Chinese industry, and we participate significantly. In most recent quarterly report and on our conference call with the analyst, out of the 15 plants, 7 are in China. We participate in all. So we have a very significant part in this. And that is necessary to develop the chip. In this, you need advanced lithography. And we have good agreements on this with our Chinese clients. So as far as I'm concerned, it is a good thing but how fast will they develop? Because if you want to be a player in the advanced chip industry, you have to have the advanced process technology, advanced technology to have the chips to what they need to do which is not necessarily the case in China, yes, in Taiwan, Korea, United States and other countries where, of course, they look and see what happens in China for the protection of the intellectual property that is an issue, of course, within the United States and China. And of course, these are things that we monitor very closely, and I can't say anything about this. No restriction whatsoever at the moment. But for the future books, we'll see in the future. China, no doubt, is ready, especially in the next decade to be a player in the advanced technology, and we are also ready to be a major player. Who else would like to say something? Mr. [indiscernible] is up.\nAttendees: I'm going to ask to further questions. The business plan. In the bad times, you survived because of the flexible model of the business plan. But more and more do you invest in the trade, Carl Zeiss [indiscernible], so the business plan is not as flexible as it used to be. Also, because the employees that you have, you want to retain them and that is by getting fewer flex employees and more permanent employees. So what about the future? Everything's up. It's only up, but what if we have not a downturn? Will you be flexible enough? Second question is that I have to really try and find out what the portfolio is like the order portfolio and what it comprises? I understand you're not going to share this with us anymore? Why not?\nExecutives: Right. Your first question. The flexible model, you're quite right in '08 and '09, the financial crisis. At that time, we use the flexibility. But still 80% is in the supply chain, and we still have a lot of flexible staff members or flex employees. The company is growing fast. So some flexible employees who've been working here for quite some times and who are performing well, you'd like them to be in a permanent position, and that's why you see the conversions. This is a situation that will remain. And don't forget in 2009, our market share was between 50% and 60%. Now it is higher so the technology section always continues through the cycles. It's always the most advanced technology. And if we look at all over sales, it is mainly through that advanced technology. I can't tell you here but it is a lot. So that is a good foundation. So we still have that flexibility. It's a little bit less, fair enough. But on the other hand, our market share increased quite considerably and the order portfolio. Our colleagues in the industry applied research and others don't share the portfolio. The order portfolio. And the reason why is that we have limited number of customers, and the way in which we plan our business, it is not traditionally based on the orders. Because for advanced lithography, the clients come to us. And the client means us to have the right machines ready for them at the right time. So it is a different production planning and sales planning. We have a very integrated relationship with our customers. The plans of our customers for the next 18 months are discussed between us and them other weekly, sometimes on a daily basis. And this means that we can check what -- how our machines connect with theirs. We look at the pedestals which is where on which the machines have to be assembled, and these things take months, so we know exactly what the client is doing, what the customer is doing. And if this is not clear and transparent, we have to second guess and we will be wrong. So we have to have a very close cooperation. So the order is mainly the end -- actually, the end of the process. So the procurement department of Samsung gives us a lot of orders and sometimes it's TSMC. The financial market concludes strengths from this that are not justified because they do not understand the background of the system. It is the end of the administrative process, and it takes us week to explain this to outsiders. And I'll be honest, we don't talk about the long-term vision and the order portfolio with the shareholders. The institutions want to know this. They look at the shorter term and they want to understand -- analysts also want to understand the real -- the true story is the way in which we sell is not the traditional driving of the order intake. And our colleagues in the industry said some time ago, okay, too much volatility, not going to do this anymore.\nExecutives: Thank you, Peter. And the Chairman says, I see that it looks like all your questions have been answered, which means that I'll go to the Secretary [indiscernible]. And on the registration date of this meeting, the outstanding number of shares of EUR 0.09 was 431,467,000 or something. And the company has a number of treasury shares, and the number of outstanding was therefore -- outstanding amounts, was [426,558 ] [indiscernible] for the shares. It's one in the ordinary share entitles to 9 votes that will be 38,839,022,567 that may be cast. And at the beginning of this meeting, we had 2,322. And the total number of shares that was either represented or present is 3,325,123,695 -- 2 billion -- in excess of 2 billion votes may be cast during this meeting, and that means that 76% of the issued share capital is represented here at this meeting including Intel, which is one of the partners in the investment program, which represents 3.2%. And the agenda of this meeting does not have any items based on which the Intel can vote based on that partnership program. As an excess of 50% of the shared capital is at this meeting all voted items on the agenda may be adopted for the simple majority of the votes cast. Agenda item 3 is the discussion of the implementation of the Dutch corporate governance code 2016. As Mr. Wennink already indicated in one of the slides and after a thorough checking and some adaptation, we came to the conclusion that we are fully compliant with the Dutch corporate governance code. And as he discussed it, I [indiscernible] that there are no questions on this topic which means that we can now go to the number -- next item of the agenda which is the implementation of the remuneration policy 2017. We must discuss this separately before we adopt the financial statements. And this is on the current remuneration policy on 2017. And it is an item to be discussed. We're not going to vote on this as you also saw in the agenda and into the explanatory notes. Mr. Schwalb, you will give us an exclusion on this I understand. Thank you.\nExecutives: Is the mic on? Can you hear me?\nExecutives: Yes. Yes.\nExecutives: Because it was red light. I was confused. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This report on the policy implementation which we all approved, you approved last year and applied already as far as for the full year. So if that happens for the base salary and the STI, the long-term incentive because the targets were set in 2015, I come back to that, of course, still follow the old policy, because it needs 3 years to get into the new policy. Now the base salary is last year, will not increase from the board of management. I think we discussed it already last year. For the short-term incentive, the payout reached a total of 91% of maximum, which is about 89% of the base salary. We have 5 targets, each rated 20%. The qualitative performance criteria, which are the technology leadership index and market position. One was achieved between target and maximum performance level, and the other one at maximum. This information is new. It is the first time that we inform you, and that detail about the achievements. We never did that in the past, so this is for the first time on your [indiscernible]. On the financial performance criteria, we inform you last year that we had 3. The EBIT margin, the EUV shipments and free cash flow. And you see here on the slide that first and the last 150% payout of target which is maxed, and the EUV shipments were at target. So below max, obviously. You also find, as promised, last year, in the annual report, I think it was Page 149, the financial targets set for this year, not the numbers of course because those will not publish, but which targets we choose and they are basically the same as 2017 i.e., EBIT margin, EUV shipments and free cash flow.\nNext slide. On the long-term incentive. As I said, the policy last year, the old policy according to the target set in 2015. So you don't find, for example, total shareholder return there, which is part of the new policy. But first targets set last year. So for the first time, we will discuss results will be in 2 years from now. \nWe had 3 targets on the old policy. That was a qualitative target, which is a combination of sustainability and technology leadership index overall, 3 years. That was evaluated at 94% of max. On the return on average of invested capital, the old system was foreseeing a comparison with a peer group of basically all U.S. companies, and it was the question of where do we rank in that list. Now we discussed last year already that this is a slight complex process and there's a lot of distortion in the system. The mathematical calculation leads us to a result leading to a payout of 63% of max. The combination of this with a qualitative target leads to a total of 69%. Now this will provide you both that this result is not really reflect properly the enormous success and development of the company in the last 3 years. And therefore, for the first time, we use our discretionary power, which is part of the remuneration policy and increase the vesting level to 75% from the 69% which was the mathematical results. So we increased it by 6% points. Why is it so complicated? Yes, it's for example, one thing which distorted the results a lot quite significantly even for some companies was the U.S. tax reform introduced end of 2017 and finding its way into the financial results of, of course, all the U.S. companies but also to a smaller extent into ASML's financial results. That is something you cannot plan and not foresee. Then of course, and other element was one company in the list made tremendous and partly, I must say also, how they accounted for it quite strange restructuring steps. And yes, last but not least, we invested a lot of in our acquisitions with the HMI and also sites last year. So all of that distorts the results quite significantly. That's why we felt this discretionary adjustment to 75% of max is justified. Now I think in hindsight, I'm even more glad that in the new policy, as of 2017, '18, '19 target period. So in 2 years to just the results that we changed from this return on average invested capital versus peers to an absolute target based on our long-term financial plans. That I hope will be a much clearer and easier to evaluate. Having said that, this is basically the report. Next year, of course, we will still have to live with the old system and its complications. So we'll see what the will bring but it will not be easy again. I can already know, not promised but I expect it. Let's see. Any questions?\nExecutives: Thank you very much for the detailed explanation. Are there any questions from the audience with respect to the way the Remuneration Committee has implemented the existing policy? If not, thank you very much. [indiscernible] for them, [indiscernible] have been crystal clear. \nI moved to point 4b. And 4b is the discussion of the board's report and also the proposal to adopt the financial statements of the company for 2017. We have an integrated report in both the financial and nonfinancial details. And again, we have 2 integrated -- we have 2 financial statements. One, based on the IFRS -- sorry, on U.S. GAAP and 1 based on the IFRS, which we used in Europe. The integrated report based on IFRS and Dutch law is submitted to you. And you were able to take cognizance of this to inspect it because it was available at the offices of the company and was published on our website. Mr. [indiscernible] of KPMG is present here today, and he will give you some insight into KPMG's audit activities for us in 2017. And any questions regarding the audit may be answered by Mr. [indiscernible]. I give the floor to your Mr. [indiscernible] Vandal.\nAttendees: Thank you. As Mr. [indiscernible] said, indeed, 2 reports were for which we issued the certificate, the U.S. GAAP and the IFRS. And it gives you some -- an insight into the effectiveness in all details. And as was mentioned the 2 different ones. And we have done the work and has resulted in a statement on that -- everything was done okay. We have some 7 pages of explanations. And I'd like you to refer to that part. I would like to highlight 3 things. Of course, ASML is a global company with centralization here in [indiscernible] of much of the work which means that the Dutch team has done the group audit mostly from the Netherlands. So the global audit was done mainly here apart from Carl Zeiss. So because of the centralized position, we can have wide coverage. Some 90% of the assets are part of direct auditing and some 90% of the revenues, we can have a review of. Our certificate also gives an insight and the key audit matters to KM. They get special attention. We had 2, in the past year, key audit matters. And that is the revenue recognition. Now our major contracts that are subdivided into smaller contracts. You have to link the right amounts to the right contracts. And of course, you have to do the recognition in times not too early, not too late to but at the right time. We look at many contracts, and we're happy with what we found. Secondly, we looked not ZEISS' major investment in the past year, a major amount and that was one of the reasons why we looked at it in detail. And it's also quite a complex contract because it is not just the investment but also the R&D corporation, so we spent a lot of time on these 2 items, and that's all I want to say so far. Does anyone have a question on this part, this item of the agenda? And Mr. [indiscernible] has a question and the mic is handed to him by Mr. [indiscernible] so that's easy.\nAttendees: Mr. [indiscernible] says, there were legal issues and you don't say a lot about specialists. And I'd like to know a little bit more about especially legal specialists. And in addition to this, there is another item, another legal item which I would like you to tell me more about. Please elucidate me on this, the qualitative, the quantitative side? Tell me what you expect. First, if we need specialist for the audit, we employ those. And you talk about the legal issues. Of course, we talk to managers. We talk to in-house legal counsel and for any major matters we request Lloyd's letters lawyers letter is means that these are letters from lawyers to give insight their views. And in addition to those players, we also spoke to external councils for major issues. And we use that input in the legal matters, the major ones are fellow we are explained properly in the financial report. Does that answer your question, sir?\nAttendees: [indiscernible].\nExecutives: The legal positions. There are 2 things you should know. First of all, you have to look at probability. [indiscernible] money flow out from the company. And secondly, you have to have reliable estimations. In major cases, that is important, so we agree with the position of the management as we put forward. Yes, we agree with management. Yes, true. Yes, that is right. Mr. [indiscernible] is not audible but the mic is on his way.\nAttendees: Mr. Wennink just gave an explanation on that. I told you what we did and of course, the outcome is never certain, but it is included in the report as it has been explained, I think that, that is sufficient.\nExecutives: I'd egg reiterate. It is more likely than not that that is going to be an obligation. And if it is not probable then, that's okay, end of story. But you have to be able if it is the case, you have to be able to quantify it and sometimes, it cannot be quantified. It could be 0. It could be a lot that is at risk. Who knows? Because you can't tell what the judge, what the court is going to do. So we'll look into the legal issues, and we concluded that we do not need additional quantitative provisions. External legal counsel agrees. the auditor agrees, Mr. [indiscernible] has just said that looking at all the facts, he agreed and that's it.\nAttendees: Yes. But is the case law?\nExecutives: Well, yes, there are other case. But that's not our case. Case law is in the past. Case law is for the court to look into, but it's no help for us to quantify. Case law is in the past. Everything that we could do was made or could make available -- was made available to you in the annual report.\nExecutives: Yes, says Mr. Stephen. But I want to turn into a [indiscernible].\nExecutives: Well, we can't. we can't. Well, Mr. Stephen, maybe you can give us an indication what you think it should be, but we have no indication whatsoever. Questions in the back.\nAttendees: My name is Mr. [indiscernible]. In which countries -- which countries did you actually visit because you said that you can assess the global situation from [indiscernible] over by e-mail, but most colleagues of yours say in other AGMs what countries they actually visited you and to [indiscernible] in Germany. I understand what other countries were visited?\nExecutives: Well, we don't do everything by e-mail but of course, we can look into all the global systems. And in the past year, I went to Korea. I want to Taiwan to the main countries for ASML, very important countries for ASML. I spoke with local management and local auditors. We also have obligations under the articles of association which we have to check. And it usually takes a little bit longer before we get those. So we do have a network of local auditors, but we could do most of the work ourselves. So we go to a couple of countries this year. We plan to go to China and to the United States of America.\nExecutives: [indiscernible]. Yes, there's been much debate about your -- well, your social interaction because your eyes and ears in companies. To what extent can you assure us that ASML's income statement is as it should be because you audited it and check whether any money items are being shifted around? For example, earnings being transferred to different year? And how did you do that and how did you establish that property at present ?\nExecutives: Well, we scrutinize the revenues, so revenue recognition are being taking at the correct point in time is something we monitor carefully. And as for the income statement, whether the assets are present and whether the company has sufficient earnings capacity. Of course, that's the case. As for intangibles, such as goodwill and activated development, of course, we look at those very carefully, too. So we think that the income sheet is as it should be. And as you see and our auditors opinion, we believe it's true and fair view. We're happy to hear that the income statement is as it should be. That comforts us and put that in writing too. But there's a lot in writing nowadays that doesn't always turn out to be true, especially if you zoom in. As for your management latter, was it longer or shorter than it was last time?\nExecutives: I would say it was about the same length. I think some items that we identified last year have been resolved, and we discovered a few new ones. What matters most is that management [indiscernible] up on this and takes it on board and they did. As for the accuracy of financial reportings, the internal audits, including cybersecurity, do you have a good opinion on those as well?\nExecutives: Well, that is why we mentioned the U.S. state where we shared concerning the financial reporting with cybersecurity, our main goal is to determine that management considers what we reported and that they also follow up with the Supervisory Board. So we see whether they follow up in sufficient manner. Thank you.\nExecutives: If there are no additional questions, then I'll hand you back to our Secretary.\nExecutives: I'll explain the voting procedure. Those of you are entitled to cast a vote at this meeting have received voting handsets and a chip card containing the data that matter for this meeting. Please insert your smart card with a gold color chip facing you into your keypad. Once you've inserted the smart card properly, you'll see a welcome message on the display, then you can keep that card inside your key factor at the meeting. If the smartcard is not inserted properly, you'll see a warning message on the display. At the moment, the vote is open. You will see the option to vote on the display. Press 1 if you are voting in favor of the proposal. Press 2 if you are voting against the proposal, and the press should -- use 3 if you would like to abstain from the vote. This display will confirm your selection. You may change your selection. But once the vote is closed, your final selection counts. If you have difficulty voting, please raise your hand and somebody will come to assist you. We'll try a dry run of voting based on a statement, and this statement as I have visited the ASML experience center before with the voting operator please activate the system. Mr. Stephen has a problem.\nAttendees: Unfortunately, the speakers is inaudible. Interpreter apologizes.\nExecutives: Yes, this timing is open. The vote has been opened for a while. Please cast your vote.\n[Voting]\nExecutives: [Foreign Language] Most of you have already voted in this trial run. So in a few moments, I'd like to close the vote. The vote is closed, and we'll wait for the outcome. And I see the outcome is available and a great, many of you has been there by now. Well, it's certainly a nice place.\nExecutives: [Foreign Language] I'd like to continue with the vote on agenda item 4. Please take your keypad and voting handset, and we've explained the procedure. And as soon as we open the vote, please cast your votes. Please open the vote on the agenda item 4b. Please cast your vote.\n[Voting]\nExecutives: [Foreign Language] See that most of you have cast your vote. So I will close the vote. [Foreign Language] It's closed. [Foreign Language] See, the result is available, and I see that the proposal has been adopted. [Foreign Language]. Okay, for some reason, the percentage just didn't add up, but you did see the result of the votes cast. We're delighted to see 100%, but that's not really right now. Clarification of the company's reserves and dividend policy. This is a discussion item, not a voting item, and the company aims to pay out a dividend that will be stable and to continue to grow. And for additional explanation on the dividend policy of the company, please see pages 88 and beyond of the integrated report for 2017. Are there any questions about this topic? Ms. Missed [indiscernible] Mr. Chairman. The share buyback from EUR 1.5 billion to EUR 2 million, of course, we don't oppose that the payout ratio stands at approximately 28%, which is a bit low if you compare that with others and questions that substantial increase is because of the increase in cash. You have a lots, so you can divert some to shareholders. That's fine. You purchased at EUR 109 million in the past, so that's a considerable profit as well to you, expect the dividend share price today. And 2 weeks ago, do we expect to create value for the shareholders by repurchasing the shares, or do you think that the share price is very high now and as for your repurchasing and timing the repurchasing, do you say we don't care with the share prices, we'll simply repurchase a chunk every quarter, or do you take direction? I'll hand you over to  to our CFO, [indiscernible] for the question.\nExecutives: Thanks for your question. We apply our capital returns policy pretty consistently for 8 to 10 years now. We do forsee a split between dividends and share buybacks. The reason for that is, it gives us flexibility and see now dividends, although, we increase them all the time, something that we do not want to take away even in the financial crisis in 2008 and '09, which can take away the dividends, but we are focused on giving money that we don't need to run the business back to shareholders. We keep sufficient cash reserves and financial flexibility also from a debt capacity, et cetera to put investments back in the business in the form of RND and M&A. And we are in constant contact with our shareholders on what type of returns the shareholders prefer. And as you can imagine, you ask other shareholders, you get different opinions. But the vast majority is agreeing with us that we keep the dividend at a manageable level. Keep the flexibility by using share buybacks, and you have seen that and walk in 2016, 2017, we were well advised to have a relatively lower dividend, because we could cut down the share buyback program when we were buying HMI and making a major equity investment in Carl Zeiss. As it relates to the volume of the share buybacks, you could see we had a EUR 1.5 billion program for 2016/'17 that we did not exhaust. We were only used EUR 900 million because of the reasons I just mentioned, and we have just announced a EUR 2.5 billion program for 2018/2019. As it relates to the share price, we are not predicting the share price. We believe it's a very appropriate form of giving back money now to the shareholder and increasing the portion of the future profits to the remaining shareholders so we have no set target price where we would start -- stop the share buyback program.\nExecutives: Thank you, [indiscernible] .\nAnalysts: Mr. Nichol. Do you, therefore, believe that at this -- with this course of action you're creating value. It's the value of our company lower than the share price suggests so. Are you creating value or you saying that's not an issue at all?\nExecutives: That a company creates value by either doing dividends or buying back shares. That's just 2 different forms of returning cash to the shareholders. The company creates value by creating an attractive product portfolio that creates value for our customers and that increases our future cash flows. I think you can also look at the theory. There is endless debates about the mix of these 2 instruments, but I firmly believe that you don't create value by the choice of the firm's, how you give money back to shareholders.\nExecutives: And as it implicity saying that -- and also when you've carefully listened to what we've said on the future of this industry and the position of ASMLit is about value creation and about growth. So in that context, I think, we have given you an indirect answer to your question.\nAnalysts: Yes, I heard that, and I understand it. But what I'm actually aiming at is whether you think that ASML is worth more than the current share price? Well that's not truly or call. That's up to the market and you, as investors. And we are good at building sophisticated machines and selling than to our customers. We aim to create as much value as possible to maximize the bottom line and generate a lot of cash, so that in addition to a minimum cash, we can distribute money to shareholders. I think that's a very -- that's an excellent policy. The market is generally saying bye. Mr. Spender? \nYes, Mr. Collier. I am [indiscernible] I have a question. Unfortunately, Mr. Nichol will be leaving us. So a buyback campaign is in progress. The new CFO that remains to be appointed, I hope for her sake that she makes the great. What instructions will she or he receive? Will that person be expected to carry out the same share buyback arrangement that Mr. Nichol devised what will the instructions be?\nExecutives: I think it's very simple. I certainly hope so. Yes, it is. Okay, for the time being the answer is yes. Financial policy, overall, has been devised by the CFO. Of course, as discussed and approved within the board and management, and we agree entirely, there is no change in financial policy. So as I was just saying, all cash about the minimum we need will be returned to shareholders as dividend and that is it going but in any case stable dividend and the rest is consist of share buyback and have no reason to assume that the new CFO might know very well is going to change that. That was my question because you devise a certain visit together with that Mr. Nichol and the supervisory report and now you will have a new deal in that position. Are you the person -- are you going to tell the new financial dude how we do it? Or will you hand that over to Mr. Klosterman?\nExecutives: No, I prefer to leave that to the new CFO to develop that with us, but I know the new CFO. And I am fully confident that it will be done with good common sense and policy, so I see no reason why we should adapt to our present dividend with the policy on returning money. All I can tell you is my estimate that any changes on our part will be extremely minimal. And I wrap up this agenda item and move on to adopting dividend of 1 year of EUR 0.40 per ordinary share, because this topic has already been discussed in agenda item 2 and forsee, I referred to the previous debate. And will now, given the opportunity to ask any additional questions, should you feel such a need. If not, then I propose that we vote on the dividend proposal. The voting operator has to activate the system. Please cast your vote.\n[Voting]\nExecutives: I see that most of you have voted. I like to close the system in a few moments. The board is closed and we will await the results. I see that the results are available and that the majority of the votes has been cast in favor of the proposal. So we note that this proposal has been adopted as well. On the agenda in the buyback. The proposal to discharge the members of the board of management from liability for carrying out other responsibilities in the financial year 2017. Would anybody like the floor on this? If not, we will open the vote on this proposal as well. Mr. Secretary, with the operator, please activate the voting system. The board is open.\n[Voting]\nExecutives: I see that most of you have cast your vote. were about to close the vote. The road is closed. I see the results of the vote are available. Over to the Chairman, and I'll have some percentages, slates partial at some places so we note that this proposal has been adopted. Next, approval of the number of shares to be allocated to the Board of management -- but wait a minute, 5B, the proposal to discharge the members of the Supervisory Board from liability. Nobody would like the floor. We'll activate the system. Open the vote with voting. Operator, please activate the system. Please cast your vote.\n[Voting]\nExecutives: We see that most of you have already voted, so we will be floating the vote in a few moments. The voters closed. I see the results are available and majority of the votes has been cast in favor of the proposal. Okay, so that's been adopted. Wonderful, we have approval now and proposal to improve the number of shares for the number of management. The ultimate allocation of shares will be done by the Supervisory Board, based on the applicable renumeration policy by applying the calculation method as described in such policy. Furthermore,, this agenda item is proposed to the general meeting to designate the Board of management as a body authorized to issue the aforementioned shares subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board. This designation is requested for the period from this meeting until the Annual General Meeting to be held in 2019. ASML has previously agreed to inform the general meeting each year that the exact number of shares granted until 19 January  2018. 43,500 -- excuse me 43,650 shares have been granted conditionally to the current Board of management, excluding the male members for the financial year 2018. The volume weighted average share price during the last quarter of the financial year 2017 equaled EUR 149.82 in connection with the appointment. Mr. Dawson has been granted a conditional board in 2019 for 10,000 performance-related shares. This grant is subject to the performance conditions and a 3-year vesting period as applicable under the renumeration policy to maximum number of shares can be obtained up to 20,000 performance related shares and in 2019, the general meeting will also be informed about the number of shares granted conditionally to the board of management for the financially 2019. Now I like to open the floor to questions. Missus Joyner?\nExecutives: Ms. Chairman, I'm [indiscernible] from the VP. Mr. Chairman, granting what I described as a sign on bonus from Mr. Dawson, we as from the VP objected on principle. He has not done anything to earn this. It's probably compensation for what he would've received at Deloitte as a long-term incentive, and we don't see any recent to compensate him for the long-term incentive and the Deloitte because it tends to be conditional and you don't know whether he achieved it. And second, you're given a staff member a bonus to keep them over the long-term within the company. If all of us agreed to take over that bonus, then we'd be done and dusted, but I don't think that's the right way to deal with a long-term incentive. That's why we object a principal to a sign on bonus. We know that, and we understand that. But the situation is a bit more subtle than that, perhaps what all 4 could explain why in this case the entire Supervisory Board supports the renumeration committees solution that this is a good way forward.\nExecutives: I'll try explain that. Mr. Dawson, in his capacity as employee of the Deloitte received only fixed income, so no variable part. That fixed income were significantly higher than what we can offer to him. And two, basically, compensate him at risk because our system has a risk, as you know, as LTI and it will follow the same LTI, the 10,000 shares, 20,000 maximum for the same LTi rules as all the other LTi's. So it can be zero, it can be 20,000, can be anything in between. So there's risk element to it so forgetting the risk, the 10,000 at target achievement on the LTI performance criteria would basically, for 3 years, roughly be equivalent to the Delta of the total direct compensation at ASML, as the fixed compensation he received at Deloitte's. That was what he felt totally reasonable and it follows performance criteria. there's no sign on bonus guaranteed, nothing, and it basically only smooth ruins it for 3 years. So if he has to show us with his own work and performance, that after that period, he either has to lift with a low salary, that's in Cadillac, or achieve a higher salary because of results.\nExecutives: Thank you, Roosevelt. Thank you. That is highly appreciated. Miss Riney is?\nAnalysts: Missus Bonior, I have we're talking about a number of shares. Are you going to reissue that you repurchase in the previous buyback? You're not going to run the process again and I, basically, subject to say Nicholas and Christmas gifts where you simply stand and wait for them. Why don't you let the person concerned work for you first and then ask shareholders after a year he's been working for a year. Can you please have this EUR 10,000 or 10,000 shares or whatever, rather than before giving him the center Class or Christmas to unwrap before he even comes on board.\nExecutives: Well, I could go along with part of this but then say, okay, he will only be able to unwrap his gift after a few years of good performance. Yes, I hear you, and I think  [[indiscernible] is trying to explain that this is not a Santa Claus or Christmas gift and his performance shares have a 3-year vesting period. And that means performing for 3 years after which there will or will not be a payment, except for the nominal chairs. It's not one year, it's about 3 years, and it has to be an empty cage to. Manor open the vote on this proposal? We'll the operator please activate the system? I see the system is active and you may now cast your vote.\n[Voting]\nExecutives: I see that the majority of you has cast your vote and in a few seconds, I'm going to close the vote. The more disclosed, and I see that the result is available and the majority is voted in the favor of the proposal, so we note that this proposal has been adopted as well. That takes us this item seven, composition of the board of management. On 12 September, 2017, we announced that both Garnica had decided, as of today shareholders meeting to leave at ASML -- excuse me, ASML. First, Mr. Vodka. We did with the entire Supervisory Board yesterday evening and the board of management. You must've done this countless times within ASML. Once again, the presence of our shareholders, we are pleased to thank you for your exceptionally valuable contribution to the growth and development of ASML. You have a magnificent CFO and Rock of Gibraltar on the management team, thank you, and your new role as buyer CFO, we wish you all the very best. It's a small world. I'm sure we'll see Sarah there in the future. We wish all the very best. And this agenda item, the Supervisory Board informs the Board of management of envisaged departments of paramedic, martyr for me, and as members of the ASML Board of management. The reasons for reappointing Mr. Manning from Limerick and someone I explained in the agenda and do not require extensive elaboration. The reappointments of running for Limited and Schneider will be for a 4-year term commencing as of today and Supervisory Board informs the general meeting that the envisaged appointment of Mr. Christophe Fouquet and Mr. Roger Dennison is as the board of management of ASML. And please see the reasons for the appointment of Mr. Fouquet and Dawson in the explanatory notes. Mr. Fouquet's appointment will commence for today. Mr. Dawson stumbled commence per one June of this year. The personal journal of Mr. Bennink, Mr. from Rick, Mr. Fouquet, Mr. Dawson as well as the main elements of their respective contracts including the renumeration package are included in the explanatory notes in the agenda of this AGM for the record that this is a discussion item, not avoiding item. The appointment is done by the Supervisory Board presuming to the company's articles of Association as stated, Mr. fork and Mr. Dawson are present Saturday. Kristof okay, please yourself and please [indiscernible] introduce yourself as well.\nExecutives: Are there any questions about the above? If Mr. Garner, if you would bear with us for a moment.\nExecutives: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm speaking on behalf of the foundation for Railway Pension fund and Public Transport Pension Fund. We support the board of management comprising qualified individuals reflecting diversity including gender. Unfortunately, the envisaged board of management is not diverse in this respect. We understand that this might be difficult because of the advanced technical expertise desired, but we wonder how ASML expects to safeguard additional gender diversity in the future board of management. \nFirst, we agree with you. In searching for a new CFO, and we were involved looking for a fellow new board and we had a lowliest comprising 12 candidates, including 4 ladies. In our interviews with the ladies, at first, 3 stated that they thought that the company was too technical. And in our interview with one of the ladies before we were able to reach conclusion, she withdrew from the procedure for the same reason at their own initiative. So the candidates -- among other candidates remaining, Dawson was selected. \nWe do aim for that 1/3, but this is a highly technological company and you need to feel at ease and it's not always easy to find people. They have to be available, and they have to be at least with the company. And the market is also restricted to Europe. We could bring people from the U.S., but we can't afford them, so that's another restriction. \nAnd apart from that, says Mr. Claxton Lake, the influx in the technological positions, we do want to try that and get more female on please. We get -- we have have quite a foreign female but dutch female employees like feline. Yes, that is a good addition. In R&D, especially, some 30%, almost 35% is female, but most of those females are from abroad, from outside the Netherlands. Mr. Garner, your turn. Thank you. Yarnell, Phoebe. This Mr. Raymond actually say that foreign CFO cannot be -- we cannot afford this? No, no, no, not foreign, American, we said. American. So you agree with [indiscernible] of ING? No, no, no, sir. You make a conclusion from a neutral. Mr. Manning, I'm sure meant to say that we do not want to have that type of -- we don't have that type of situation here. Okay, says Mr. [indiscernible]. I'm happy with that. So that's fine. Two, I'll come to CFO, CEO. They are not economists. Fair enough. That's good, because they always agree. So the 2 accountants. Maybe that is good. And an accountant can transform into General Manager as Mr. Vining has shown us. So Mr. Dawson. For his whole career has worked in accountancy. So even from the long list to the short list. Did you actually do a kind of assessment in respect of how an accountant can manage the managerial qualities because an accountant is always right after the fact, but the manager has to also know things beforehand requires a different attitude. We do not know in how far this person will be able to manage. The due diligence of Mr. Dawson, how was this done son? Who was it done with? We understand that Mr. Bennink knows him quite well. So you know that what to expect from this person but was there any further due diligence before Mr. Dawson was introduced? Final question, and really, I need to say this but do not take this personally. In the claims, there have been many claims against auditors/accountants. Did you make sure that Mr. Dawson does not -- was not involved in any conflicting situations and delight? Mr. Castro. There was a very careful process. First of all, the committee and the full Supervisory Board, we looked at the profile, what kind of person do we want. Because the CFO must not just make sure that the numbers are crunched properly, but that he also can connect various parts of the company, the various people of the boards, did this very well, did this emphatically. And we wanted to keep that for the new CFO. So we had a profile drafted. We also had -- we have the long list, went to the short list. And the whole management team, which is the whole Board of management, and the nomination committee, we all interviewed 3 candidates. We did 4, you did 3, I think. We interviewed these people. Based on the interviews, we saw the differences in the qualities of the people, in their personalities, we looked at what could be the advantages, what could be the disadvantages, what are their strengths for ASML, what are their weaknesses for ASML. And after a very long procedure with due care, all of us unanimously, both boards support the appointment of OJ Dawson. And we worked with a third firm, a head hunter that did a lot of work, preliminary work. An independent firm that headhunter, who did recommendations or data assessments, we, ourselves, for a couple of people, who in the past worked with OJ Dawson in various positions, we got information from them directly and they made us even more enthusiastic to appoint OJ for this position. And I would like to add Mr. Bennink that in the past few years, it was the Vice Chairman of a worldwide organization and that was nostrils being an accountant, that was managerial, so that was, that different type of work, but also you have to look forward in that and not backward. So I heard so that your questions have been answered by what we just set? No, no there is one outstanding. He was responsible for some international part of delight? As a person, how was Dashwood was actually involved in any business or anything that wasn't quite kosher? Well, no, we know nothing of this. And as far as we we're able to check this, nothing was found that pointed in this direction. So I hereby note that on behalf of the Supervisory Board, messages that Mr. Fouquet was formally appointed on April 25, 2018 and Mr. Dawson, effective 1 June, 2018 and also [indiscernible] from [indiscernible] have been appointed. So congratulations on everyone on the reappointment and on their appointment, which brings us to the composition of the Supervisory Board, and we have 2 voted items and 1 discussion item. The voted items can serve a proposals to appoint and reappoint certain members of the Supervisory Board. And as we announced last year, [indiscernible] and [indiscernible] we're entire meditation for this meeting. And Mr. Lemaire has indicated that she does not wish to be reappointed and she will resign as a Supervisory Board member. And Pulley, dear [indiscernible], thank you so much, yet she is over there, thank you to you too for you would turn the past 9 years. You are so involved in your engagement in the Supervisory Board, but you're also a member of the selection and nomination committee, and you had a very important role in that, and you were also part of the audit committee. So thank you so much for what you did for us, and we will miss you. As a person and her contribution to this Supervisory Board. Mr. Storck indicated that he is available for reappointment and the Supervisory Board has decided to nominate him for reappointment. And furthermore, the Supervisory Board wishes to nominate Mr. Eckley as a member of the Supervisory Board and Ms. Kelly is also here today, and the explanatory notes to the agenda contained motivations for this nominations and the personal details of those candidates. And the appointment of Ms. Kelly and the appointment of Mr. Storck will be effective this meeting and will both be for a 4-year period. The shareholders did not use the right of recommendation with respect to these vacancies. The Works Council did not recommend any candidate for the vacancy, following Mr. Stall time per rotation. The Works Council has decided to use its enhanced recommendation right for the nomination of Ms. Kelly. And the Works Council was given timely -- was given time to give its opinion on the opportunity on the appointment and the reappointment of these 2 people, so Ms. Kelly, would you stand up, please so you show yourself to the meeting? And again, I give the meeting the opportunity to put questions, if you wish to make use of that opportunity. Yes, Mr. Davis just raised his hand. He would like to ask the question.\nAnalysts: Thank you, Jimmy. My name is [indiscernible]. What about Ms. Kelly's own motivation? We'd like to hear from her. Why she wants to join them?\nExecutives: So my history has been working for a highly technical company for the past last 35 years. My background is actually in the mechanical engineering. I have been the CEO of that company for the past 13 years, and I'll stepping down. But don't want to retire, and so I'm very excited about what  happening at ASML and the technology and also I am very committed to the workforce and creating the right environment. So I think it's a perfect match of where ASML is in the growth projections ahead and just when I think I can contribute.\nExecutives: Thank you very much. With that, we are going to move to the appointment of [indiscernible]. The secretary will reopen the boat and the claim or the secretary, Mr. Clay port says that the voting is now open, and Mr. Clark's delay explains again that it is the proposal to report Mr. Stokes as a member of the Supervisory Board for 4 years that is being voted on at the moment. Mr. Claypool's says take note that most of you, have indeed, noted, so let's deactivate the voting system and you can no longer cast your votes. The results is available, and the chair says, we note that Hans has been reappointed. Congratulations. The appointment of Ms. Kelly as a member of the Supervisory Board also for 4 years. The operator is asked to activate the voting system. It is now open. You may cast your votes.\n[Voting]\nExecutives: Most of you have voted. So we will close the vote. We have actually now closed the vote and the result is available. And as you can see, the chair says that we see that the proposals been adopted. Congratulations to the new member, Ms. Kelly. The Supervisory Board advises you that by 2019, there will be various vacancies in Supervisory Board. In 2019, myself, Ms. Anis, Mr. Schwab and Mr.C Mark, they will all retire by rotation. And all members are in principle available for reappointment. The general meeting, the AGM Works Council have the right recommend other candidates for these vacancies. Those counsel has enhanced recommendation right for the vacancy that will result from the retirement of Ms. Alice. And I'll give you now the opportunity to put questions. Mr. Stevens has just raised his hand.\nAnalysts: Thank you, chair. My name is Stevens, and my organization is very much for continuity in a company. And next year, 50% of the members will retire by rotation. They are available for reappointment, you say, but things may change between now and then. What if all 4 person say no, we don't want to be reappointed. We are not available, which would be difficult. Well, yes, as Mr. Class to live, we said we are, in principle, available for reappointment. Well, yes, says the person. A lot can happen in 4 years time. So may be you will not have 4 people available for reappointment. And Mr. Class says, what -- you can't change all 4 people joined on a certain days, but we'd will bear this in mind, of course, because we are going to try and do this in a more staggered way in the future. So we will continue to look for enhancement of the Supervisory Board with the more staggered situation, so that we don't have the same situation that for people do by rotation. So they have 4 years first and then 2 years for reappointment. We'll try, and as I say, there's a bit more, but this was created apparently at the time when we needed new blood in Supervisory Board. There is nothing we can do about that right now at this moment. \nOkay, this was a discussion item, not a voted item. So let's continue with the next item of the agenda, which is the proposal to appoint KPMG as the external auditor for 2019. As you will have read in the explanatory notes to the agenda, KPMG accountant has done the audit for 2017, and we have had an assessment of the job done and the quality scope and planning of the audit was assessed, pursuant to the outcome of this survey, we proposed to, again, put KPMG as the external auditor. And therefore, the Supervisory Board for the recommendation of the audit committee proposes to point KPMG as the company's external auditor. Would you like to ask any questions? Specific questions will be answered by Ms. Smith's muscling, because she is the chair of the committee. No questions? Let's vote Last. Secretary asks the operator to activate the voting system, which is, indeed, now open.\n[Voting]\nExecutives: I can see that most of you have voted. So in a few seconds, we'll close the system, which is actually being done now. And the result is available, so I give the floor to the chair, who says that this is item  adopted, and we continue with item 10 of the agenda, which comprises items A, B, C and D, and we will vote on each of these items. It is an annual recurring item of the agenda, but an important one. And it is in the company's interest, and that of you the shareholders to be able to react quickly, if particular circumstances arise for which issue of shares is required. Therefore, the board of management would like to be able to issue shares when such circumstances, indeed, arise and exclude the preemption right where it is necessary to act quickly. And as an example, in 2020, we use this authorization for the acquisition of Cymer, and in 2016, for the acquisition of Hammer's micro vision. It was also used for the issue of convertible bonds in the past. And the authorizations to be granted will be valid for 18 months from today until 25 October, 2019. If you do adopt the proposals of this agenda item, the existing authorizations will expire. 10-A is the authorization of the board of management to issue ordinary shares, or to grant rights to subscribe for ordinary shares in the company's share capital, for general purposes, limited to 5% of the issued share capital at the time of organization, and of course, subject to Supervisory Board's approval. Items 10-B is the authorization of the board of management to restrict, or even exclude the preemption rights that are accrued to shareholders in connection with 10-A of the gender act. This also subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board. \nAfter this, we'll continue with 10-C, which is the authorization of the board of management, as the body to issue shares or grant rights to subscribe for shares for an additional 5% of the current share capital of the company. Also, subject to Supervisory Board approval. And this additional 5% can only be used on the occasion of mergers, acquisitions and/or strategic alliances. And then finally, we have items 10-D. Again, this is an authorization for the Board of management and in this case it is to restrict our exclude the preemption rights accruing to shareholders in connection with the issue of shares or rights to subscribe for shares as described on the list 10-C. And as with the other items, this is subject to Supervisory Board approval nobody wishes to take the floor, so let's start boarding. 10-A.\n[Voting]\nExecutives: As the majority of votes been cast, the system will soon close. Yes, you can no longer cast their votes, and we see that a majority has voted in favor. So we can continue with 10-B. And again, the operator activates the system. Please cast your votes.\n[Voting]\nExecutives: As most of you have voted, we will close the vote in a few seconds. Yes, we record the results and the choices that we can see that this item was also adopted. 10-C is now to be voted on in the same procedure applies.\n[Voting]\nExecutives: Yes. We closed the vote as a majority votes have been already cast. You can no longer vote. The result is available. And the majority's cast in votes was casted in favor. Final item of the 10 is D. Please vote on D.\n[Voting]\nExecutives: We will soon see the result on the screen after the vote has been closed. And the majority of votes was cast in favor, so this proposal has also been adopted. Agenda items 11 and 12. The to acquire and cancel order ordinary shares and this is because of the flexibility for the return of capital to the shareholders. Such flexibility requires a mandate for further share buybacks and to adopt further the of shares. Should the company decide to do so? And as you will understand, this depends on various factors and you are advised that there is no certainty as to further return of capital or as the timing of another potential distribution, nor as how to achieve such distribution, and this was already addressed on the agenda item 2. I will deal with these 2 items, 11 and 12 separately. 11 is a proposal to authorize the board of management to acquire ordinary shares, a max of 10%, that is, and is subject to Supervisory Board approval. We have listed that conditions at the explanatory notes and that was agenda 11. The agenda item 11A and 11B is for further maximum ten percent, with additional conditions as set out in the explanatory notes to the agenda and the reason why we ask this additional authorization is for further flexibility in the execution of a distribution of capital to use the shareholders and these authorizations are requested for 18 months from today until 25 October, 2019. If you adopt these 2 proposals, the existing authorizations will expire. And I see that nobody has a question, so let's vote on 11A , which is the authorization to repurchase up to 10% max of the issued share capital. Voting is now open.\n[Voting]\nExecutives: [Foreign Language] We have 82 votes show the result on the screen, and it was adopted. This item. Next, 11B, that is the additional repurchasing or repurchasing of an additional ten percent of the issued share capital. We all know that on this.\n[Voting]\nExecutives: You can no longer cast your votes. And the result is available and the chair says, we see that this was adopted. Agenda item 12 is a proposal to cancel ordinary shares and that may be done in one or more parcels or blocks. And the number of shares to be canceled will be determined by the Board of management, but will never exceed 20% of the issued share capital as today. No questions. Please vote on item 12 on the agenda.\n[Voting]\nExecutives: The vote is closed now and the results are available and the chair says that this was adopted, agenda item 12, which brings us to any other business. Does anyone have any questions that you wish to put? And Mr.Peña just raised his hand. \nMr. Chair, my name is still [indiscernible]. I have a question. 5G for the telecommunications industry. Do you see that other companies want more machine because 5G, that drones will be able to communicate and they cannot do that with the use of 4G. So maybe you already have a higher demand? Whether you can deliver machines at a certain time that a kind of 5G compliant or something?\nExecutives: Well, quick answer. It is an improvement of the 4G technology and there is a very limited number of applications for 5G. At this stage, and there's hardly a business case. They will be one, but it will take a while, but it will be of no significance to ASML.\nAnalysts: Chair. My name is sure. Have a question, were actually a remark. Big data. This afternoon, it was mentioned, there's a -- it's important in today's world, major companies, Apple, Facebook, deal with Big data. Some 80% of the 70% of all big data is in their hands. Big data, multiply and distort one another. It plays a big role in the holistic chain. Continuously deviations are being monitors -- monitored. Two, correct the precision of this. In this chain, a lot of data are stored on lots of things. My question is, what about -- how do you control these big data within the company? I have an other example. You have a lot of suppliers, some-100 suppliers, more than 100 suppliers. Some also are involved in research for the next generation, a lot of data. And these are not the data that we used to have, the drawings and the plans that you can file. So tell me a little bit more about this. Do you have a designated department, or will you set up a designated department for big data? It is an issue in the world and Oxford and Cambridge are specialized, and they warn us about this topic.\nExecutives: Okay. Big data -- is alive talk about big data, of course, that's a hot topic that encompasses quite a few ideas. You're addressing to very specific aspects in ASML, where we deal with the data transactions gathering and using it in our machines. I think you could say something about that marking but the very simple answer is, it's completely screened from any external disclosure. Is it one department that deals with everything overall? No, it's single policy. Until recently, dealing with these large data files was very specific, but at our initiative, it's turn -- merged into one department that handles the Big data Lake in a standardized manner. Now a few comments about the machine. We have extensive access to the machine production data. Theoretically, we even have access to the chip design, so that we can optimize the chip. Now as for how we deal with the sensitive data, the main issue is that with the customers and there's a company that is still manufacturing chips for others and west keep all the technology in general. We design the tools to optimize but the data remains in the factory. And to the extent that data is necessary to enter machines, we have very specific agreements on data access, and they certainly don't consider chip layout or the wafers where it's manufactured. So might it be a good idea to address this in a subsequent time report and the data and how you deal with it or did I not read the report in detail and is it already there? I don't believe that you didn't read the Annual Report. Yes, that's part of our entire strategic decision-making process. You're entirely right. The party that hold the data the value, and that's the truth. But our data is far from straightforward. And in the years ahead, we certainly have to explore that with the platform They always called in Google's and the Amazon's in this world. I'm sure that quite a bit of what ran under the bridge before is clear exactly how that needs to be dealt with and is also a social issue. What about our service engineers, the application engineers that work together with customers? They often have no access to data from outside the factory. They have to be in the data room itself to help optimize. Question was notable, answer is absolutely. Thank you. \nThank you. Good afternoon, I am [indiscernible], I am up in a shareholder since 2001. I'm very, very happy. First, like last year, I'd like to thank Mr. Public or character off again. And it seems to be increasingly difficult to attend this meeting but Mr. Follicle arranged it once again. Do understand that in total it holds only 3% of the share -- and Samsung is out of the picture? No, Samsung still has some shares. And we have had this debate in the past too. I didn't understand it at that time, perhaps Mr. Wennink could explained to me. Once again, why he is opposed to a stock dividend? That was my impression. Well, yes. I've -- I get that question a lot. The stock dividend and the share premium is statically very attractive option for private investors in the Netherlands, but institutionally, it doesn't really matter, because it's mainly the pension funds that won the cash dividend. And if you would she have shares, then they would have to sell it and that, of course, my efforts was more convenient for them to receive it in cash. 96% of our shareholders are institutional investors. So it's quite a hassle and they don't really want to deal with the hassle. Yes, but then Phillips doesn't, by default, and shall start into it again in the past 2 years, and it certainly adds up. But these are shares that have been traditionally very popular among retail investors, that's not the case in our company. So is that attractive to you and there's only 4% there any way, or even less. If there are no other questions, I like to thank you for coming and for your interest and for your questions and I'm closing this meeting and invite you for snacks and beverages in the lobby outside. Thank you.\nExecutives: Before we open the official meeting, I have a few general announcements. First, please switch off your cell phone. Part of this meeting will be conducted in English, and we have interpreters for those who don't understand English, and they will interpret the English section. You can listen to the interpretation by the headset you received. This translation of the meeting is also available via the headphones. Microphones are available in this room. If you would like the floor, please state your name briefly and ask to keep your questions short and snappy. And I would -- for due procedure in the meeting I may need to curtail speaking tongue or the number of questions. \nI hereby open the ASML Holding N.V. Annual General Meeting, and welcome you as our shareholders.\nI'm going to introduce the members of the board of management. Mr. Wennink; Mr. van den Brink; and Mr. Nickl, seated next to me. And then Mr. van Hout; and Schneider-Maunoury on the front row. Also, the members of the Supervisory Board include the ladies [indiscernible] and [indiscernible]; and the Messrs.  Grose, Schwalb and [indiscernible]. Messrs. Smits-Nusteling, Mr. [ Grose ] and Mr. Schwalb are to my right on the stage and I'm also pleased to welcome Mrs. Kelly, whose appointment to the Supervisory Board is an agenda item at this meeting.  I'm also pleased to welcome Messrs. [indiscernible] and Fouquet, whose appointment as members of the board of management of ASML will be discussed at this meeting. \nThe general meeting has been convened with due observance of ASML's Articles of Association of Dutch law and the meeting will be transmitted live via audio webcast and audio recording will be made of the meeting to draft the minutes.\nMr. Reinier Kleipool will serve as secretary to this meeting. He's a candidate civil law notary at De Brauw Blackstone Westbroek. The details of the registration for this meeting are currently being processed before we vote, Mr. Kleipool will report how many people are present here as shareholders or proxy holders and how many votes may be cast. Mr. Kleipool will also explain the voting procedure and will perform a test run. And he will guide the voting procedure during the meeting.\nPursuant to the provisions of the corporate governance code, the external auditor ASML KPMG is present today. On behalf of KPMG, we have Mr. [ Van Delden ] present. He will be able to answer questions concerning the audit report on the ASML financial statements for 2017.\nNow on to agenda item 2, which is a review of the operations, the financials and the corporate social responsibility activities of the firm. And I'm pleased to hand you over to Mr. Wennink.\nExecutives: Thank you. I'd like to review 2017 rapidly with you. Of course, you've seen the financial statements. They're not very detailed. \n2017 was an excellent year, the best year in the company's history. Revenue exceeded EUR 9 billion. So net sales grew by 33% and there was a gross margin of 45%. And that was also a record annual margin. Net income grew 44% to exceed EUR 2 billion. And our earnings per share equaled EUR 4.93, that's nearly EUR 5 per share.\nIn addition, and this is important, our share in installed base services grew. Those are the services and the physical upgrade of our installed base in the field. So it grew -- that share grew by about 25% to a record EUR 2.7 billion. \nWe are the most rapidly growing section in the company aside from EUV. Now on the subject of EUV, last year, we revealed a capability of 125 wafers per hour as we indicated in the Q1 results. We had the strength of the lighting source at a level that we can generate a minimum of 125 wafers per hour. But now we're focusing on that machine's availability to minimize downtime because that machine still has some growing pains and teething troubles. But we'll talk about that and we'll work them out too, we'll resolve them.\nNow Deep UV is our bread-and-butter product. That's how we earn our daily bread. Last year, that reflected a 21% increase from 2016 and their Holistic Lithography, that we'll touch on later on, is also pivotal in a rapidly growing company. As for 2017, that was an important year. We reached an important strategic agreement with our partner, Tran Zeiss, and -- Carl Zeiss, excuse me, and that division is -- it's a truly symbiotic relationship with our partner Carl Zeiss. And it's very important because it reinforces this strategic partnership.  And it provides a foundation for research and development procedure for the next generation of EUV machines, which will be toward the middle of the decade ahead. \nBut we received our first commissions for research and development, and those R&D systems will be -- we'll start shipping those at the end of 2021 and then continuing in 2022 and what we call the early systems will start in 2023 and '24, ramping up in the next decade so that technology will take us past the end of the next decade.\nNow capital return, last year, we returned about EUR 1 billion to shareholders, about half through dividends and half through share buybacks so that the number of shares in issue is declining. And given the share earnings ratio, it impacts the share price on the stock exchange.\nNow as for EUV, what do customers care about? They've indicated that in 2017, in Q1 2018, they've expressed confidence in EUV, and that's [ indispensable ] of the next generations of advanced chips. We received 9 orders for the -- for Q1 and completed -- we've got about 36 EUV systems in our order portfolio. In 2017, we broke EUR 1 billion in sales for the first time, and we're planning about 20 systems for this year. Our capacity is 30 systems in 2019.\nNow what matters in EUV at present? Not so much the technological question as to does it work? It works as proven by all the orders that our customers have placed with us. So it also means this is the new technology. But we have to make sure that teething troubles that are ongoing concerning the shelf life of certain parts, it -- we need to maximize the availability of the machines for those customers. So our target is to get availability above 90%. That concerns our Deep UV systems. And in the years ahead, we want to ensure that Deep UV machines can be used with the same -- the EUV machines need to be used with the same intensity as Deep UV machines, and that means that we are ready for industrialization. We can take them industrial and have some technical milestones from last year. \nProductivity exceeded 125 wafers per hour. We've got the pellicle, that's a membrane that we attach to the photo, negative the photomask, to avoid pollution on the mask. There was a technological issue as to whether we were capable of applying such an extremely thin membrane, such an extremely thin pellicle and it all worked. And what's also important, because the EUV doesn't work in isolation, it works together with DPV systems. And if used them together, you can make chips so that the 2 technologies align in a matched overlay. And then they work together so that the positioning accuracy of it, Deep UV machine and an EUV machine, if you use 1 after the other, it's accurate to less than 1 -- 2 millionth of a millimeter. So that's very accurate usage. \nNow our product strategy, if you consider ASML 5 or 10 years ago, we did only that huge scanner in photocopying machine. But over time, we've added many new products. And you see this holistic lithography triad. We built this projection machine. But a few years ago, we started thinking about improving the process range because you need a photo negative to use it in that appropriate -- the dedicated machine. And we call that the process scope. We call that the process window. And that helps us improve the print for our customers. And it was about 15 years -- no, nearly 20 years ago when we started this. And we took the first steps. And later on, we purchased a company such as Brion that was nearly 10 years ago.\nAnd if you know what this photo negative should look like to get the optimal print, then you want to know whether it actually works that way. So you need a way to control that process window and we thought of measurement systems, that's the YieldStar that was developed by ASML. And in 2016, we also purchased HMI, that's a Taiwanese company that develops inspection equipment to see whether the machine actually does what we think it does. And once you know that, then you can also use the measurement and inspection data to improve the process window. So then you bring that data back to the potential chip design and toward the machine because there are thousands of knobs on that machine to change settings. So there's a feedback loop to support customers in that increasing complexity that we see in the chip industry where everything becomes tinier. And this exponentially enhances calculation, power and the storage capacity. The advanced chips keeps improving, but it's also increasingly complex. So to be certain that the design will end up on the chip and that we can quickly correct any defects we observe, it's very important to optimize the output. \nOver time, we have transitioned from building large cameras in photocopying machines to supplying process solutions. And that's what you see here in 2016, we purchased HMI. And in 2017, we had the first combined machine integrating ASML technology with the HMI technology. So we've come full circle. And the first machine shipped at the end of 2017. \nNow what does this mean? We call it a holistic lithography that should -- so not just the printer, it's knowledge about the photo negative and the photomask and the measurement and inspection equipment and how they all interact. So it's holistic vision of how customers should use the tiniest little membrane on the chip. So that means that the YieldStar machine can exist alongside the HMI machine together with a Deep UV and the EUV machine. And they interact perfectly. And this is particularly important when we head to the next generation of chips. The most advanced chip now has the smallest measurement of 10 nanometers. And you can get it from 3 to 7 to 2. \nNow who are we doing this? Of course, with our customers and with our people, our employees. One of the challenges is to keep employment up and keep the right people. \nNow if you've read the newspapers, you'll see that ASML is certainly drawing attention from qualified engineers, and our HR division processes over 1,000 applications a year. And we do need 100,000 people. But our international contingent is increasing because there simply aren't enough people in the Netherlands. We have over 100 nationalities working in this campus in Veldhoven.  At the end of the year, we had 19,200 people and 700 people came from the HMI acquisition. But at the end of Q1 2018, we're already up to 20,200 people. So that means we've added 1,000 employees. \nHow do you find them? That's a serious challenge and Sebastian was the 10,000th working in Eindhoven. You see this in the Eindhoven Daily. So that half people -- half the people work in Veldhoven, and the other half work abroad. Divide that equally between Asia and the United States. \nNow let's talk about the financials. Also meant to those because we are going to talk about the financial statements. As I said, 33% growth in net sales in 2017, what we call base management. So that's tending to the machines in the field, not just servicing them but also upgrading them to the next generation. Well, that's growing at pace from 1.1 million to nearly 2.7 million -- from EUR 2.1 billion to nearly EUR 2.7 billion. And we see that in absolute terms, we still have excellent revenues. But in the memory chips, we see a lot of growth in that market. \nThe market has nearly doubled and that growth is continuing. We all deal with that. And you, your children and your grandchildren will all be using the cloud. You already use it. So there are a great many data solutions and software solutions that are no longer on your PC or your tablet, no. They're basically driven and managed and processed in the cloud through huge data centers. And that means that the huge data supply needs to be processed very quickly. So demand for what we call high-power computing. \nSo systems where the chips have a fantastic computational power, that needs to be nurtured and supported by a very powerful operating memory and storage capacity because all those data need to be stored in the cloud that we want to obtain it from later on. So you need to see the cloud applications in terms of artificial intelligence, self driving cars, virtual reality, and the traditional communication through a smartphone, your PC. Everything is driven by that cloud. So that means -- that means that the sophisticated powerful computation chips are not possible unless they're supported by very powerful memory chips. \nSo whereas in the past the memory chips market was not growing very quickly. With the advance of the cloud, you see a massive rise in these sophisticated memory chips. You saw that in 2017 and it's continuing in 2018.\nNow as for the figures, 33% top line growth, 45% gross earnings margin. That's good. And this margin takes into account that we're not really making a lot of money on EUV yet in 2017. It's even slightly negative. And of course, that depresses the gross earnings margin. But we went from -- it went from EUR 300 million to EUR 1.1 billion at a low margin, but we managed to increase that margin because the rest of the company is operating more efficiently. \nAs for the EUV margin, we are fully confident as we indicated that by 2020, it will be between 35% and 40%. 40% is a nice target, and it's a viable target. Why? Because the EUV systems, if you look outside, you see a huge factory. And last year only a few systems came from that factory. But we can get about 45 systems from them. So you can compute those fixed costs. If you have 12 systems, then the fixed -- the overhead is very high. But if you have 45, you'll have a much lower overhead. \nIn addition, by 2020, we'll have a learning curve so we'll be cutting costs. And that will also manifest. We have other more productive EUV systems, so they're more valuable. That's the third reason. And keep in mind, we have service organization, very complex machines that require dozens of people to service it.\nAnd then there's infrastructure that we need to assemble in the field. We're incurring those costs now. And the warranty period on those machines is still pending. But by 2020, they'll no longer be covered by the warranty. So if you add all of this, there's little doubt that by 2020, we'll have a margin between 35% and 40%. And compared with the projected margin for the company as a whole, that will exceed 50%.\nNow net result, one more point, R&D costs, they increased by EUR 160 million. And we envisage that same increase in 2018 when we head to the next EUV generation. First, we'll spend on R&D both at ASML and ZEISS, which we largely finance. So that will keep rising. But the top line for 2018 will be up as well due to the reasons I just told you about.\nNet income is up 44% to -- it exceeds EUR 2 billion, and as I mentioned, nearly EUR 5 per share in earnings.  Bookings value was over EUR 9 billion last year at the end of Q1. I'm sure that you can do the numbers yourself, at nearly EUR 7 billion for order portfolio at the end of Q1. So things are looking good in this company. \nNow as for cash flow, what are we doing with those earnings? At present, we have what we call free cash flow that's after all the investments and settling the financing transactions and after we invest the cash from earnings into working capital, we have about 7% of the net earnings. That's not where we want to be, we'd like a bit more. But that's the way things are because we're accumulating working capital for the EUV ramp. That's going to cost a lot of money. And in 2017 we invested EUR 1 billion in our Carl Zeiss venture. \nAnd looking at the balance sheet, we see equity method investments. As said, that's nearly EUR 1 billion that's Carl Zeiss. It's well-financed -- very solvent company. So we can fund that growth and cover the R&D expenses and make the necessary investments to grow that company further. \nNow as for the shareholders, last year, about EUR 1 billion was returned to the shareholders. About 0.5 million was paid in dividend -- excuse me, EUR 0.5 billion was paid in dividend and EUR 0.5 billion was paid in shares. But we had to wait until we made that payment to ZEISS. And after we did that, we resumed the share buyback. We proposed increasing the dividend to EUR 1.40. We'll talk about that later on. \nWe've also announced a new share buyback program to the tune of EUR 2.5 billion, of which the first buyback was achieved in Q1 2018 and that will continue in the quarters ahead. \nNow I'll briefly result -- I'll briefly summarize the Q1 results. The Q1 was fine, it was just above the market guidance we had set to -- we achieved EUR 2.2 billion. The gross margin was high because we booked little EUV sales in Q1. In Q2, we expect more. And the operating margin was 28%. That was looking good. And quite a good order intake to the tune of EUR 2.4 billion. \nNow outlook for Q2, we see that net sales are expected to increase to EUR 2.5 billion to EUR 2.6 billion comprising EUR 600 million for EUV. That's considerably more than in Q1 at a lower margin. The margin is in the black, but it's not the same as the Deep UV margin, and it certainly impacts gross earnings. But that will settle up in the rest of the year. So we're not worried about the gross earnings percentage for 2018. We'll get there. \nR&D costs will rise a bit because we had those next generation orders. Those systems will cost EUR 270 million each. We've received 4 orders and we purchased 8 options on early volume systems, all yielding a potential EUR 1.5 billion cash flow. If you receive the money in the bank, that's great, but you have to work to get there. So that's why our R&D costs will take us to the next level. We're both in Veldhoven and in Germany at Carl Zeiss. We'll make our first investments.\nNow here's my last slide. Corporate governance code from 2016 was implemented as of 1 January, 2017. We are entirely compliant with this code. In our view, we performed a complete review of our corporate governance structure, not only the structure, also the internal processes. And we reviewed the agreements that we reached about rules for the board of management and the Supervisory Board. We've amended those to comply with the new corporate governance legislation. And as you would expect from us, we're particularly focused on being in compliance with the applicable rules of good corporate governance. \nAnd I'd like to wrap up on this note. Gerhard will move on to the next item.\nExecutives: Fine, which brings me to you people who are here in the room. You may have some questions. And I see that Mr. Stevens has raised his hand.\nExecutives: And let's get a mic to Mr. Stevens. All the way from the back the mic comes to Mr. Stevens.\nAttendees: Mr. Stevens with the association to protect the rights of the shareholders. You've said quite a few things already about the cash flow, about results. We have a different computational method these days, and through that method, we find out that your capacity to earn back the money is quite weak. And we looked into this a bit further, and we found out what you already said, too. The new machines have a lower profit margin. And then if we look at the market, at the market for chips, and we see that there is a lower demand for smartphones, there are more chips for crypto and for artificial intelligence, supercomputers, the Internet of Things. Okay, if we look even deeper than this, we see that in the next generation machines coming up in possibly the next decade, but if you have a lower profit margin, if that is reduced, you will have to get the money to develop the new machines from the cash flow. And we'd like you to tell us a little bit more about this. Let's explain that a little bit further, please. And something else that we noted, the intangible assets, that is 60% approximately of the book value, which we feel, well, that's quite a bit, isn't it? And then let's continue with something else that you mentioned, the 80% you mentioned. Could this harm the company? Because there is less faith in the company. How do you manage this? [ It is not quite clear what Mr. Stevens means by the 80% ]. You said it's okay but that is what you say. But what does the market think? Legal disputes at the level at which you operate, you will have those legal disputes, of course. And they will be lengthy ones, no doubt. But we ask you to tell us a little bit more about the dispute that you have at ZEISS, you and ZEISS with Nikon. That has been ongoing for a while. And for us outsiders, we just read a little bit about this and then hear a little bit about this, but it is very hard for us with a little bit of knowledge to assess how that is going. \nNationalities, you mentioned the number of nationalities of the employees. Well, you have mentioned that. And then maybe people do not understand one another, all those nationalities. Do you have particular people that you employ who are designated to make sure that everybody understands everything, that people work well together and that there is no conflict between people who work here? These are our questions for the time being. Thank you.\nExecutives: Thank you and Mr. Wennink is going to answer the questions.\nExecutives: Mr. Stevens, thank you so much for the context of the market. But you've already said it. I said it. We have no concerns about the market nor the market growth. Smartphones have shown single-digit growth in the past couple of years. The double figure growth of smartphones was years ago. But it's not just the smartphones, mind you. It is also the Internet, the cloud, the cryptocurrencies, the artificial intelligence, the autonomous cars. It's all of that. It is to that window of the advanced chips, that scope, that range is becoming broader. So the demand is also increasing. And you will not be surprised to know that we have very good expectations for the growth with that potential of this company. And we have no worries to be able to earn back the investment as you will have seen and have seen in the past years. It will not stop at 2017. The profit margins of the new machines, okay, good question. You want to know more about this? I already indicated that profit margins, how we wish to get those at the required levels for the current machines. And the new machines, yes, as you said, much will have to be invested in that. But we no longer have to invest in the EUV light source. The light source was our problem. That used to be a problem but we will use the same light source. By mid-next decade, we'll have a much higher reliability than we have now. Because we have learnt in addition to which we have agreements with Carl Zeiss, as mentioned. A part of their capital goods are funded, quite a big part of that. And we will get that money back. We'll get that back because we consider these 2 companies 1 business which means that we have agreed that we are entitled to a certain return on our investments, and that return will be paid back through a lower price that we have to pay for the lenses. So for the next-generation EUV lenses, when we get those, we'll have huge mark down as a result of our investments. So the profit margins for the new machines will be considerably better initially than those for the current EUV. So the light source is the result -- is the reason for that because we've learned and the lens price will have been adapted because of that requirement of a return on our investments. So I do believe that the cash flow, free cash flow will be able to finance this, especially because our market is growing, and we have no doubt, nor do our clients have any doubt, because of course there is reason why they've already placed the orders that they have placed. They have good faith in us. There is EUR 1.5 billion on their way from their bank accounts to ours. So they must have some faith. Yes, the immaterial assets, the 60% you mentioned, yes, true, it is 60%. And it has to come from our own equity and then you have the corrections on both sides of the balance sheet. So there's sufficient solvency, no worries. Availability of the machines, that is quite right. The Deep EUV (sic) [ Deep UV ] machine does work technically. It's not being industrialized yet. A lot of work has to be done yet because of the shelf life of the elements, the parts. If you use it for a long time, will it still have the same quality? And we have that learning curve all the time, in all transitions. We have a very detailed plan. The -- to get the availability of the machine up from the 80% you mentioned to 90%. So we have a lot of projects that are concurrent. Thousands of people are working on that. In addition to our client because, of course, the client wants to use this as much as possible. So the 80% availability, we know where we stand, we know where we wish to stand. Especially in the past couple of months, the last most recent quarter, there were some breakthroughs regarding to the reliability of the EUV light source. We had some concerns on the mirror that catches the light, whether the shelf life would be such that it would be attractive for customers. But as I said, we have quite a few breakthroughs, and we have all faced that we can have a 90-plus percent availability. \nNext, the legal disputes that you mentioned, that has already been explained before in the financial statements. It is not uncommon, as you said, in our industry to have this type of dispute. We had Qualcomm and Apple and Samsung, and of course, tens or dozens of thousands of patents are filed by these major companies. And of course, after a while, people don't quite agree or companies don't quite agree. And these are very lengthy proceedings on very complex technology. Yes, and there is litigation and we will explain to the court that we are not worried about the validity of our patents, that they are ours, that they are unique. And we enter the battle. And of course, we have to wait and see whether the court agrees with our point of view. We do feel, of course, that the court will agree, but we'll have to wait and see. We cannot say anything else. I haven't got a crystal ball. I cannot tell you what will happen in the future. \nThen all those nationalities in our company. Yes, quite a valid commentary. They have to work together, even though they come from all corners of the world. So 80% or 85% of our staff are university-educated. And especially people who work in that field and who come from universities from across the world, they mainly speak English. Sometimes I have meetings, lunches with new staff members who join us, and their command of the English language is very good. They have an excellent command of the English language. So we speak mainly English in this company. That is the common language that we use. And it's not so much the language that is the issue, but the way of working. So we have special programs to make sure that the new hires are given a buddy, a buddy who shows them what the procedures are, what the system is, give them an explanation on what is expected from the new hires. There is transparency about the type of work they have to do and how this contributes to the work that others do. We pay a lot of attention to this. You are quite right if you don't do this, people just run around not knowing where to go. So that does have our special attention. And in the meeting that we had with the Supervisory Board, it was discussed at length, too. So yes, from that point. Thank you. There's a lot of attention for this.\nExecutives: Thank you. Anyone else? On the left-hand side here.\nAttendees: [indiscernible] is my name. My compliments for your results and also for the annual report. I have some minor questions. First of all, the transition to 7 nanometers and beyond, do you agree, sir, that the total market worldwide, I think it is from 35 billion up to maybe 50 billion, and I hear reports on the intensity. They feel that it is higher than the lithography intensity of this market. But I'd like your opinion on this, sir. And the second question is something that you already mentioned. In 10 to 12 years, there's a transition to 2 nanometers. And then we get to the post-optics era. I do not know whether you're already doing any R&D into the post-optics era, but what I want to ask is what do you think of the long-term outlook with regards to those post optics. \nGross margin, 49% in Q1. So that's a wonderful result. So not just for the more modern tools but the old-fashioned tools. So high 40s, low 50s. When do you expect those for the EUV? And the final question is the innovation box. For taxes, the fiscal, how do you see the development regarding that, the taxes that need to be paid in the future? Those are my 4 questions.\nExecutives: Okay, the questions will be answered, 3 and 4 by Wolfgang. I will answer 1 and somebody else will answer question 2. The world fab-equipment market to make the chips, yes, indeed, some 50 billion, quite a considerable growth. Do bear in mind that the sales of our top line clients also had turbulent growth. And we are in a period, if you look at the market in which we operate, and we have to subdivide this into 3 segments: the logics, the memory chips, which is -- which supports the logic, DRAM, and the NAND chips, the storage chips for storage of data. Those 3, you have to break it down into these 3.  And all 3 submarkets are hot, which has to do with the cloud, the Internet of Things, those developments. But if you look at the third segments, the NAND, the storage chips so to speak, we progress to a new technology. The number of bits on those is determined by the number of layers. And those layers, for that you need deposition, you need etching. And every layer has deposition step and an etching step, which means that you have to have the pattern, you need lithography part. But storage chips is -- we have some colleagues in that market. Relatively speaking, they benefit a lot from that market. So that litho intensity as a percentage of the total CapEx, which is our money spent on this equipment, decreases. It goes down. But in absolute terms, lithography does not go down. Because if you go to all -- to the multilayer strategy, you need more deposition, you need more etch. So that's good for our colleagues. And DRAM and in logic, it's a different situation because in those 2 segments, we have to deal with -- we have very complex designs, especially in logics, random, very complex layer of the chips, sometimes 3, 4, 5, 6 times it has to go through the machine just for 1 layer and EUV makes this very simply. We can just do it in 1 step. But if you have to do it 5 to 6 times, then you also have to have the 5 to 6 times deposition layer, etching layer. So good for our colleagues once more. But if we reduce those 5 to 6 layers to 1 and we do it through EUV machine, which is double the price, then the relative share of the EUV machine or if the lithography goes up as a part of the total costs and our colleagues go down. So you see the opposite happen, not just for logic but also for DRAM. So what you have to do, you have to look at those market segments, and in certain segments of the market, litho intensity increases and then in the other markets, there is a relatively -- a relative downturn. But overall, because DRAM and logic is the bigger part of the market, the litho intensity will increase. Thank you.\nExecutives: The post optics well, I'm very happy with the HMI orders. I'm very happy with those. So the bandwidth is different. I am -- I will function or operate until the next decade. You talk about 2 nanometers. Where do we stand today? If you buy an advanced Apple phone, there are 10 nanometers chips in there. And which the new technology we feel that it is usable at 1 nanometer. Now we may speculate 10 years ahead. What could happen after 1 nanometer? But there are lots of questions. So let me not go into that right now. We are now into expanding the current EUV machines. And in the short term, as Peter says, it will simplify the processing. And that will be soon 5 to 3 nanometers. And there'll be a situation in which we will have various exposures, double patterning, which will result in more process steps, higher costs [indiscernible] through the HMA, it will go down, and there will be a new situation. And what happens after, well, I can't really tell you yet. Maybe we can talk about this some time in the near future. But what is important over the next decade is the number of layers, the number of exposures that is required will have the imaging done with a lower resolution and will have to have a higher throughput. Those are the main things for the next decade. And this should be right, together with some processing tricks to get up to the required nanometer level. Costs, Wolfgang, EUV margin tax burden, the innovation box.\nExecutives: The gross margin and innovation box as well. Gross margin, a repeat part of what Peter already said. There is a big difference between our EUV business currently, although we make great progress year-over-year, and the rest of our business. So in a given quarter, you can have quite some churn. Like for instance, in Q2, we'll ship -- we'll have almost 4x the revenue in EUV than we have in Q1 and you can see we've gone from 49%, almost 49%, to 43%. That will level itself out throughout the year. We said publicly that this year, although we haven't given a specific number, that the overall company gross margin will progress from the 45% that we achieved last year, despite the fact that the EUV business is doubling in size again. So that, of course, shows that we're making progress in EUV. And we talk a lot about EUV, but we also continue to create a lot of value in the non-EUV business. But it's often forgotten that half of our R&D budget goes to non-EUV products, Deep UV, Holistic Lithography and so forth. And we continue to create value there and we share that with the customer. But we have the opportunity to increase the margins there as well. We spelled out quite specifically, and Peter mentioned the 4 criteria: volume, cost, mix and then the service business, how we get in the ZIP code of 40% gross margin by 2020, I think it's very feasible if we achieve the volumes and the tool does what it's supposed to do. It's very feasible. And that will enable us as a company to cross the 50% mark, which is our milestone for 2020. Beyond 2020, we have never said that we stop at 40% for EUV. We'll continue to make the tool better. We'll have more throughput. There will be newer versions of the tool. And then I think we also said that the inherent gross margin of high-NA by its value proposition is potentially higher than what the pre-high-NA EUV does. So we're pretty comfortable that we can continue to increase the gross margin of the company over the next couple of years. \nNow as it relates to the innovation box, many governments in the world do have tax systems that support innovation, because, from an economic standpoint, that is what drives growth in those countries. It's not just the Netherlands. There's also tax credits, research tax credits in the U.S., for instance, as you know. The innovation box has been adjusted last year, also based on OECD rules. So the Netherlands has also adjusted the innovation box. And we're happy that we qualified again for the innovation box. Just as a reminder, ASML declares about more than 80% of our profits in the Netherlands, and it's clearly viewed as a win-win what we do here, because for every job we have at ASML, we believe there are 3 to 4 jobs in the supply chain. Universities prosper. There's lots of incremental growth for society. We got it prolonged, the conditions for those of you who are in the details have adjusted a little bit. So the advantageous tax rate is 2% higher than it used to be, but it's still advantageous. And we were able to get an agreement for 7 years. And that is supporting us with our overall model where we think in the 2020 timeframe, we'll continue to be at about a 14% tax rate for the company. So we're quite pleased with that situation.\nExecutives: Thank you, Wolfgang. Then we move up 1.\nAttendees: Thank you, chair. My name is André Jorna on behalf of the association of stockholders, in the Netherlands chair. It seems as if the trees grow up as far as heaven. They reach the sky and the sky is the limit. And you wonder about disruptive developments. And Mr. van den Brink may have seemed to have pointed it out already after the 1 nanometer. But if you live here locally, you hear from the TU in Eindhoven, the technical university, you hear about the photonic chip that they are developing, and the photonic chips is through light. And it is the processing of the major data, the big data. And Internet with the major data centers, you already mentioned the cloud. We need a lot. And with those photons that respond differently than electrons, especially with respect to light, they would be faster, less energy. They could even be sensors. So the machines that you have, can these machines really supply the industry for when the photonic chips are going to be made. So if that day comes, will the machines, the EUV and the high EUV, will they be able to handle this? That is my first topic. And then two, you are way ahead of the competition, way, way ahead. And with the current knowledge that you have and the range of machines, you are 100% monopolist, the high-end pricing power. How can you use that in EUV? You said you get a discount or markdown at Carl Zeiss. Do you also give discounts to those major partners of yours, Samsung, TSMC, Intel? Do they get a discount on the EUV machines or do you take things easy and by 2020 you think, we'll get the profit then? So the pricing power of the EUV machines, things go very fast. You do not want to have any wasted assets, and you of course, want to get a return on your development investments. And then I have another question. The role of diminishing returns is -- we see that the machines become more complex. They cost a lot of money. They become more and more expensive. And there could be less demand. It's not for a mass-market, of course, that consideration. Is that something that you talk about or are you just going to wait and see what will happen? That is maybe something that you can't tell. Mr. Nickl, the CFO, likes risks, but controlled risks, I understand. So I'm quite curious to know as to your risks. The production capacity, you do not say, no, we haven't got it. But you say I've got a delay. It's later, but later could be counterproductive. You invested in Carl Zeiss, you bought some companies. Is it possible the production goes up to 40? Can it be higher than that? Or is that not something that the market requires? And then my final question for now, in the past 2 to 3 weeks, we've had a bit of a fright regarding what we hear about the chips industry. You say those analysts, all nonsense because the chip [ cycly ] -- [ cyclicists ] haven't got those anymore, forget that. And some companies have to give a profit warning. I saw Mr. [ Lobizo ] -- oh, it was TSMC with the profit warning and [ Lobizo ] said, \"Don't worry, things are fine.\" But still, you hear these things and then you hear that the chip industry is past its zenith. Can I sleep quietly tonight?\nExecutives: Well, you should. You should sleep without any worries. Okay, we see that there's disruption throughout the room. Now following up on what I said about post optics, I think it will remain optical even after 1 nanometer. As for photonic chips, I think that our customer is thinking about different types of technologies not only photonic chips. We're also talking about quantum computing, different computer architectures. So we see that customers are looking for different architectures to boost their system performance. We believe that whatever the technology becomes, it will always, for cost reasons, it will always include miniaturizing the connections. Secondary is how those connections are made. What matters that in all cases, you need to apply those connections photographically. That's our stock in trade. We want to do things as small as possible not only in dimensions. We also want to maximize accuracy, and we want to do so as quickly as possible. We believe this is generic for any technology, and the innovation that you mention as well as other innovations will ultimately benefit total volume and total lithography demand. So we don't believe that -- we don't believe it's possible to make these advanced chips in large volumes without involving lithography. And of course, our [ counter ] price will need the right material. But we'll keep at it. Now I have 1 comment about the next questions related to this and after that, we'll discuss the finances. You asked about the value of boosting performance. You mentioned the 270 million High-NA and that's quite curious winning those High-NA orders. And charging that price is not just because of our pricing power that we can also rationalize at the performance improvement of the machine. The productivity has increased the value such that the price is rationalized. And the technology is so complex that we need a bigger coverage to ensure the margin. And the question is also is the machine worth the technology? And we have to work all that out before we develop the machines. And if we are developing such a large machine, we need to know that the machine is worth it so that we won't run into problems once the machine is there. And that's the value of the orders from big customers. And I'll hand you over to my fellow board members now.\nExecutives: Excellent, martin. That's a wonderful run up to answering questions 2 and 3, the questions about pricing power and the law of diminishing returns. Martin explained it very clearly. The way -- this is how we've always done the pricing. When I joined ASML, the most expensive machine cost EUR 5 million. We just sold the machine for EUR 270 million and the customer is still buying it. And this is because of Moore's law, because Moore's law is an empirical law of economics. You have the cost per function every few years. So the cost per function or transistor 20 years ago when I arrived, the machine at EUR 5 million, those costs were considerably higher than what the customer calculates as cost per transistor for the EUR 270 million machine that will be operational in 2025. That's an exponential reduction in costs, and that's exactly the cost of the machine. If you use a logarithmic scale to calculate the cost reduction, if we can calculate what lithography adds to those costs then he would say that, at that cost reduction half will borne by ASML and half by the customer. That's always been our principle. And basically, we've been able to increase the price from EUR 5 million to EUR 270 million, and we still sell. It's true that fewer machines are sold, but that's simply because the transistor density because of the continuous miniaturization, density is increasing exponentially as is the productivity of as the machine, so you don't need as many machines. But each machine becomes far more expensive, so that's the ASML top line. As for discounts, we sell the current EUV machine at 100% capacity. It's not yielding that yet, so you can say customers are getting a discount. But the way we put that pricing together relates to sharing the cost benefit. And we've always priced that way and we'll continue doing that in the future. As for the question about production capacity. Now it's 40 to 45 systems, which will continue in the different chains. We'll reduce throughput time in the factory as much as possible, because if we can use the same square meters, you can build more machines if you accelerate throughput times. So this is the most economic approach. If we need higher numbers, let's say, we need 60, then we'll need to increase production capacity. I'm talking in terms of square meters. That's not relevant yet, but it depends on how successful we are and how many more EUV machines we need to build. We need that run-up time of 2, 2.5 years to increase capacity levels.  once we get there, we'll have the prospect book higher sales. Now the last question is an update on the check industry. Despite what my predecessors said, I'm not going to say that there are no cycles in the semiconductor industry. That's logical. I'll give you one example of the different segments. The DRAM segment for the memory chips, there are 3 suppliers for that. A better example. Look at the mem chips. Those are the storage chips, they're [indiscernible] [Audio Gap] that's 5 suppliers for those Intel, Toshiba, Samsung, Hynix and Micron. If each of them decides to build a new factory at the same time, those are huge factories that cost between $5 billion and $8 billion each. And let's say that they are all competed at the same point, then you get a step of a huge increase in capacity. Now the bit demand increases by 40% to 50% a year, so you'll grow quickly there. But temporarily, in the short term, it may lead to surplus capacity and the market will react to that. But as for the medium and long term and the TSMC story, it's not just that the smartphones are less, but the high-powered computer chips that go to the server parts and the data centers and that they continue powering the cloud. That demand is ongoing. And as for TSMC, we are investing more in our 7- and 5-nanometer machines. Why are they doing that? Because if you look at the Apples and the Oracles in this world, that has a huge window. There are a vast number of applications for that chip. So in the medium term, we can invest more because we envisage growth. So that's justified. Whether you have a short-term view or medium to long-term, the short-term view will focus on temporary surplus capacity in a certain segment, or in the medium term, they shouldn't -- you don't worry about that.\nAttendees: [Audio Gap] Executives and Non-Executive Representatives and of course, also all other ASML employees. My name is Denise Reike, and I represent De Vereniging van Beleggers voor Duurzame Ontwikkeling, or in English: Dutch Association of Investors for Sustainable Development. We consist of 60 institutional and over 600 private investors who support our aim to make the Dutch capital market more sustainable. And for many years now, we have been visiting ASML's AGMs as an opportunity to point to diverse stakeholder groups, your sustainability achievements made over the past year, but also of course as a possibility to further drive corporate sustainability implementation within ASML in our role as share and stakeholder. So I have 2 questions. But before that, may we -- let me make a small remark that we were a bit surprised about the relatively short item of sustainability on the agenda. Maybe, we're going to hear more about implementation of the Code but we were hoping to also see other topics addressed this year. The question that I have regards 2 topics. One is energy consumption and the other one is the payment of a living wage in the supply chain. ASML has a 10% energy savings target for 2020, taking 2015 as a reference year. And we've seen that in 2017, savings that -- and '16, a saving of 35.1 and 48.8 terajoule have been achieved. But on the other hand, on Page 174 of the annual report of this year, we find that energy consumption regarding your own operations has increased and also, significantly, compared to 2015 levels. So since 2020 is not so far away, we are wondering how sure is ASML to actually meet this target of absolute reduction compared to 2015 levels also, given the growth that we're seeing currently. In the report that we can read that you are being on track, which is not the same confident formulation that we have also heard regarding some other items today. So we were wondering how will you assure to meet this target? And also, have you already looked into energy targets beyond 2020? And regarding the living wage, I would first like to compliment you because you've made an explicit reference in the annual report that you support this concept. And we were glad to see that. We understand that within ASML directly, and luckily, living wages are not an issue and probably also not in the first supply chain tier with suppliers such as Carl Zeiss. However, we think that looking at the wider supply chain, this might well be an underaddressed issue. And as ASML has repeatedly recognized its responsibility when it comes to deeper supply chains. For example, with the conflict-free mineral initiative engagement, we are wondering how informed is ASML regarding payment of a living wage deeper in the supply chain? For instance, when it comes to this initiative or also beyond. And do you see a role for yourself in further driving this point on the agenda; for instance, in the former EICC or through owned initiatives such as an inclusion of this as a requirement in your supplier Code of Conduct?\nExecutives: Okay, there's some many, many questions of 2 main questions, so there's a lot of sub-questions. I think first on the 2015, or let's say, the 2020 target with reference to 2015, you're absolutely correct. The 10% is our target. But I have to say that you are correct in absolute terms, our energy usage will go up for the simple reason that the EUV machines will actually need more energy, and then -- because the number of EUVs will actually grow, and we need to test them and they actually take a lot of energy. That is inherent and at -- in the design of it because we use high power CO2 lasers to regenerate EUV light which, where the conversion efficiency is -- let's say, is undeniably low, and there is some physical limitations of how much you can drive that conversion efficiency up. Now I have to say that the EUV machines are very important for the total ecosystem because by shrinking the transistors on the chip, the energy usage of the chip will go down significantly. And as you know, I'm pretty sure that as you know, that when you look at the advanced data centers, they are enormous users of energy. So more advanced chips will actually drive the energy consumption down but you need, unfortunately, an EUV system for it that initially needs a high energy input. But I think the equation, from a broader perspective, gives a very positive business case, you could say, on the use of EUV systems and further shrink. Now that doesn't mean that we're not working at lowering the energy usage of the systems, which will be part of the further designs of those tools. There will be a further reduction of the energy usage or the -- let's say, the conversion efficiency driving that up. Now having said that, well, it is inevitable that we will, with the growth of the EUV business, start using, in absolute terms, more energy. We are focusing on reaching our target of 100% renewable energy by 2020. And currently, we're at 72%. Now how do we do that? We are sourcing this through the guarantee of origin projects, where we make sure that we buy renewable energy, those labels are actually there. Yes? So why we cannot avoid, as a higher usage, the focus on renewable energies and also the funding of what we call the guarantee of origin projects which we do, yes, will enable us to at least have a significant contribution to this issue. And the targets beyond 2020. Yes, we are formulating currently targets beyond 2020. It has to do with the fact that we are really looking at the focus areas of our sustainable strategy as defined by the United Nations framework whereby, basically, as we are looking at what the most relevant items are of that framework as to -- as it relates to the ASML strategy. And that will determine, and it's probably going back from 9 to 5 focused areas where we are currently defining the 2025 strategic targets. And when we think about this and the SDGs of the United Nations, the Sustainable Development Goals that have been formulated, I think we're basically focusing or we'll very likely focus on the 5 most important ones. And I think it's the quality of education whereby people development and training is extremely important. We furthermore have what we call the decent work and economic growth in our goal, which is the co-development with the suppliers. It actually relates to your second question. And we have to make sure that all our suppliers, and we are making sure that all our suppliers are part of the Responsible Business Alliance and have signed that Code. Industry and innovation as a third SDG whereby industry innovation and the way that we innovate is very much driven by our open innovation concept, which is very typical to ASML whereby, for instance, our R&D charge, which this year is significantly over the -- close to EUR 1.3 billion of last year's is shared in the supply chain, about 45% of our R&D is not with ASML. It's with our partners and our suppliers. SDG 12 was about the responsible consumption and production that focused very much on the circular economy. Now we have or close to 100%, over 99% of our parts -- sorry? So 99% of our parts are actually recirculated. Our tools in the field, we have special upgrade programs to make sure that they are not decommissioned and that they're actually reused and they're upgraded to the next level of performance. And on the climate action, we talked about it. This is about the energy efficiency of our products, about the conversion efficiency focus we have in EUV. And I think, making sure that the electricity that we use is 100% renewable. And those out of 5 -- I think the 5 core areas of focus that we will put into our sustainable strategy going forward. And that will lead to 2025 targets that we will share with you in our next integrated report. We need to define those targets as a board, and we need to agree with them with our senior management group, but that will be the result of the work that we will do this year. On your question of the living wages, I will go back to what I said earlier. It's one of the target areas of the SDG focus that we will have going forward. It is very much part of our focus of -- on our supply chain and where we do our supplier audits. The supplier audits involve not only quality logistic technology and cost but also a fifth element we just called sustainability, and we require that our suppliers are part and have underwritten the code of the Responsible Business Alliance, which, of course, needs to support the whole concept of the living wage. Now you ask a question about how deep does our insight go into the supply chain. It doesn't stop at Tier 1. It very often goes down to tiers 2 and 3 and even 4. it depends a little bit on what we are buying. But what we are buying generally is technology that is developed and manufactured in countries that are subscribing to the sustainable development goals and actually companies that are public companies and have underwritten those goals. So for our suppliers, it is a requirement to underwrite those -- the Responsible Business Alliance code papers, but it is not a major issue for them because it is very often part of their sustainable strategy already. So we happen to have a supply chain that doesn't operate in areas where a living wage is a real issue. That is an advantage of this company, but also we make sure that our suppliers live up to the Code.\nExecutives: Thank you, Peter. The next question?\nAttendees: I'm [ Terry Yeltson ]. I'd also like to compliment you on those figures. It's great that you manage to sustain those year-after-year. I was wondering in recent months. Of course, ASML learns from technological breakthroughs in physics, chemistry and mathematics. And can you tell me about other factors? Do your errors in accelerations relate to embedded software? Because I imagine there are millions of codes in those machines. So in other words, is it that the problem relate to physics or the chemistry or is it -- does the problem also relate to computer science? I think that Mr. van den Brink is the best person to answer that, but I do note that the EUV machine has 51 million lines of code, so that's quite a challenge.\nExecutives: Martin?\nExecutives: I would like to say that building machines comprises many different disciplines, not just physics. I would say that straightforward machine building involves many different elements and even more software than the 50 million lines of codes. But what we've been working on in recent years is that expanding to greater automation and Mr. Wennink showed you our holistic triad in lithography with machines at the top and computational lithography at the bottom and other computational features. So in California and in China, there are software developments that make it possible to simulate chip production and that's not a [ panacea ] involves extremely sophisticated software and that simulation is to be calculated. We use self-learning algorithms for that, that can optimize the entire process. So we see a growing role for software but it's not -- it's the integration between the software and the hardware. They need to be aligned. I'd almost say that's the secret of our technology. We have another question at the left there.\nAttendees: Mr. Chairman, I'm Mr. [indiscernible] from Amsterdam. I have a question based on the annual report. It is very readable, but I still have a few questions, that the message of the CEO, because you're right that there is increasing scope of application for semiconductors. That's true. And you mentioned that you -- that wonderful products need -- require good employees and ASML depends on them. That's also true. But then, in the [ updated ] Dutch financial daily on 21 April, 2018 there was a remuneration specialist, short a button, who explained that to some extent, money is secondary. If the nonfinancial aspects that carry the most weight in considering job changes. Then, I look on your website, and I see a vast number of vacancies. I'm not sure why you didn't find candidates for them. Is it because of those nonfinancial aspects? And at ASML, you're aiming to achieve more -- a lot smaller, more powerful and more energy-efficient but -- and more cost-efficient, too. But I'm wondering is why are there so many unfilled vacancies in your company? Is it because of the people in the organization? I'd like to face-off with you about that. Perhaps, do you need to offer some nonfinancial incentives? I'd like you to tell me more about that. And of course, this morning, I read the Dutch financial daily and that was quite a shock because Mr. Nickl is leaving. Couldn't you retain him for the nonfinancials? I thought that was a pity. But then I read on, and you also have the most patents because of your technology, and there are at least 2 people in your organization who are being considered for a wonderful award. So that's good news. But I think it sad that Mr. Nickl is leaving.\nExecutives: Okay, duly noted. We agree but we found an excellent success in Mr. Dressel, we'll tell you more about him later on.\nAttendees: I'm not there yet, but I'd certainly like you to tell me who is in charge of nonfinancial aspects.\nExecutives: Okay, first Mr. Wennink will talk about the growth of ASML, the contingent of employees and our pace in filling vacancies.\nExecutives: Unfilled vacancies. This is mainly to do with the fact of timing, because at the moment, says Mr. Wennink, we have an annual run rate as we call it. So the vacancies in the past 12 months, actually, I should say the job applicants, more than 100,000, but we only need a couple of thousand. So we have to be very selective. Yes, we need people but we need to right people and that financial part only a very small part, you're quite right. And of course, we pay good wages. No doubt about that. We pay well. But people in Silicon Valley, they come to ASML because they've had it to make emoticons for WhatsApp. So they'd rather make algorithms, complex machines such as [ remake ]. And maybe they've  entered via through, or maybe huge entity through the Plaza and that is a great place for all those hundreds of [indiscernible] more than 100 nationalities to meet those people. So it's not just how much you earn but also what you get, what you experience. And we have a very low churn rate. People stay because it's not just the financial reward. It is what they do with whom they work, what the company is like. And yes, we still have a lot of vacancies because it takes about 3 to 4 months before you find the right people. So we always have some vacancies. There will always be some vacancies. We'll never have every spot filled, but our HR department is convinced that with those major influx of people that apply for jobs because apparently, we have a very good reputation as an employer, so it's not going to be any trouble to fill the vacancies that we wish to fill. We will be able to do that.\nExecutives: Thank you, Peter. So the nonfinancial benefits of ASML are quite good, the fringe benefits. And Mr. [indiscernible] speaks but without use of the mic so he's not quite audible to the interpreters. Okay, that is not a problem. The average age is very stable. We have a lot of new hires from our universities. So they make sure that the average age is a bit lower than the average age that you see here behind this desk. We're a bit older than the average employee is.\nAttendees: The next question, I read in the past couple of weeks that China has an emphasis for the next 10 to 20 years of the production of chips. My question to you, which is an inevitable question I feel, how do you view the development? And what is your position in this? And my second question is I hear that you developed software in China, and the -- what about the intellectual property rights of ASML and the parties in China that you work with?\nExecutives: By the way, that last bit is not right, says Mr. Wennink. That's not so. It is not a condition, so that doesn't bother us.\nAttendees: So disregard this because that's not the situation. So China, how do you view China?\nExecutives: Quite evident, I would say. I think that as indicated in the 5-year plan, they are going from being the sweatshop of the world to top-end value-adding, and it's been made very clear that the semiconductor industry and the chip industry is essential in this. They will invest some [ EUR ] 200 billion in the local Chinese industry, and we participate significantly. In our most recent quarterly report and our conference call with the analysts, out of the 15 plants, 7 are in China. We participate in all, so we have a very significant part in this. And that is necessary to develop the chip industry, you need advanced lithography. And we have good agreements on this with our Chinese clients. So as far as I'm concerned, it is a good thing but how fast will they develop? Because if you want to be a player in the advanced chip industry, you have to have the advanced process technology, advanced technology to have the chips do what they need to do, which is not necessarily the case in China. Yes in Taiwan, Korea, United States, among other countries where, of course, they look and see what happens in China for the protection of the intellectual property. That is an issue, of course, between the United States and China and, of course, these are things that we monitor very closely and -- I can't [ see ] anything about this, no restriction whatsoever at the moment. But what the future brings, we'll see in the future. China, no doubt, is ready, especially in the next decade to be a player in the advanced technology, and we are also ready to be a major player. Who else would like to say something? Mr. [indiscernible] is up.\nAttendees: I'm going to ask to further questions. The business plan. In the bad times, you survived because of the flexible model of the business plan. But more and more do you invest in the trades, [ Sima ], Carl Zeiss, [ HMI ] So your business plan is not as flexible as it used to be. Also, because the employees that you have, you want to retain them and that is by getting fewer flex employees and more permanent employees. So what about the future? Everything's go -- it's on the up, but what if we have another downturn? Will you be flexible enough? Second question is that I had to really try and find out what the portfolio is like, the order portfolio and what it comprises. I understand you're not going to share this with us anymore? Why not?\nExecutives: Right. Your first question. The flexible model, you're quite right in '08 and '09, the financial crisis. At that time, we used that flexibility. But still 80% is in the supply chain, and we still have a lot of flexible staff members or flex employees. The company is growing fast. So some flexible employees who've been working here for quite some time and who are performing well, you'd like them to be in a permanent position, and that's why you see the conversions. This is a situation that will remain. And don't forget in 2009, our market share was between 50% and 60%. Now it is higher so the technology transection always continues through the cycles. It's always the most advanced technology. And if we look at all over sales, it is mainly through that advanced technology. I can't tell you here but it is a lot. So that is a good foundation. So we still have that flexibility. It's a little bit less, fair enough. But on the other hand, our market share increased quite considerably. And then the order portfolio. Our colleagues in the industry applied research and others don't share the portfolio, the order portfolio. And the reason why is that we have limited number of customers, and the way in which we plan our business, it is not traditionally based on the orders because for advanced lithography, the clients come to us. And the client needs us to have the right machines ready for them at the right time. So it is a different production planning and a sales planning. It's a very -- we have a very integrated relationship with our customers. The plans of our customers for the next 18 months are discussed between us and them on the weekly, sometimes on a daily basis. And this means that we can check what -- how our machines connect with theirs. We look at the pedestals which is where -- on which the machines have to be assembled, and these things take months. So we know exactly what the client is doing, what the customer is doing. And if this is not clear and transparent, we have to second-guess and we will be wrong. So we have to have a very close cooperation so the order is mainly the end -- actually, the end of the process. So the procurement department of Samsung gives us a lot of orders and sometimes it's TSMC. The financial market concludes [ strengths ] from this that are not justified because they do not understand the background of this system. It is the end of the administrative process, and it takes us weeks to explain this to outsiders. And I'll be honest, we don't talk about the long-term vision and the order portfolios with the shareholders. The institutions want to know this. They look at the shorter term and they want to understand -- analysts also want to understand the real -- the true story is that the way in which we sell is not like the traditional driving of the order intake. And our colleagues in the industry said some time ago, okay, too much volatility, not going to do this anymore.\nExecutives: Thank you, Peter. And the Chairman says, I see that it looks like all your questions have been answered, which means that I'll go to the Secretary.\nExecutives: Thank you, Chair. And on the registration date of this meeting, the outstanding number of shares of EUR 0.09 was 431,467,000 or something. And the company has a number of treasury shares, and the number of outstanding was therefore -- outstanding amounts, was [ 426,558,060 ] for the shares. It's one in the ordinary share entitles to 9 votes that will be 38,839,022,567 votes that may be cast. And at the beginning of this meeting, we had 2,322. And the total number of shares that was either represented or present is 3,325,123,695 -- 2 billion -- in excess of 2 billion votes may be cast during this meeting, and that means that 76% of the issued share capital is represented here at this meeting including Intel, which is one of the partners in the investment program, which represents 3.2%. And the agenda of this meeting does not have any items based on which the Intel can vote based on that partnership program. As an excess of 50% of the shared capital is at this meeting, all voting items on the agenda may be adopted with the simple majority of the votes cast. Agenda item 3 is the discussion of the implementation of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code 2016. As Mr. Wennink already indicated in one of his slides and after a thorough checking and from adaptation, we came to the conclusion that we are fully compliant with the Dutch Corporate Governance Code. And as he discussed it, I feel that there are no questions on this topic which means that we can now go to the number -- next item of the agenda which is the implementation of the Remuneration Policy 2017. We must discuss this separately before we adopt the financial statements. And this is on the current remuneration policy on 2017. And it is an item to be discussed. We're not going to vote on this, as you also saw in the agenda and into the explanatory notes. Mr. Schwalb, you will give us an explanation on this I understand. Thank you.\nExecutives: Is the mic on? Can you hear me?\nExecutives: Yes. Yes.\nExecutives: Because it was red light. I was confused. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This reports on the policy implementation which we all approved, you approved last year and it applied already as for the full year. So that happens for the base salary and the STI. The long-term incentive, because the targets were set in 2015, I come back to that, of course, still follow the old policy because it needs 3 years to get into the new policy. Now the base salaries last year were not increased for the board of management. I think we discussed it already last year. For the short-term incentive, the payout reached a total of 91% of maximum, which is about 89% of the base salary. We have 5 targets, each rated 20%. The qualitative performance criteria, which are the technology leadership index and market position. One was achieved between target and maximum performance level, and the other one at maximum. This information is new. It is the first time that we inform you in that detail about the achievements. We never did that in the past, so this is for the first time on your [ visage ]. On the financial performance criteria, we inform you last year that we had 3. The EBIT margin, the EUV shipments and free cash flow. And you see here on the slide that first and the last were 150% payout of target, which is max, and the EUV shipments were at target. So below max, obviously. You also find, as promised last year in the annual report, I think it was Page 149, the financial targets set for this year, not the numbers of course because those we will not publish, but which targets we chose and they are basically the same as for 2017 i.e., EBIT margin, EUV shipments and free cash flow.\nNext slide. On the long-term incentive. As I said, but this still follows the old policy according to targets set in 2015. So you don't find, for example, total shareholder return there, which is part of the new policy. But the first targets were set last year. So the first time we will discuss results will be in 2 years from now. \nWe had 3 targets on the old policy. That was a qualitative target, which is a combination of sustainability and technology leadership index over 3 years. That was evaluated at 94% of max. On the return on average of invested capital, the old system was foreseeing a comparison with a peer group of basically all U.S. companies, and it was the question of where do we rank in that list. Now we discussed last year already that this is a quite complex process and there's a lot of distortion in that system. The mathematical calculation leads us to a result leading to a payout of 63% of max. The combination of this with a qualitative target leads to a total of 69%. Now the supervisory board felt that this result does not really reflect properly the enormous success and development of the company in the last 3 years. And therefore, for the first time, we used our discretionary power, which is part of the remuneration policy and increased the vesting level to 75% from the 69% which was the mathematical results. So we increased it by 6% points. Why is it so complicated? Yes, it's -- for example, one thing which distorted the results a lot, quite significantly even for some companies, was the U.S. tax reform introduced end of 2017 and finding its way into the financial results of, of course, all the U.S. companies but also to a smaller extent into ASML's financial results. That is something you cannot plan and not foresee. Then of course, another element was one company in the list made tremendous and partly, I must say also, how they accounted for it, quite strange restructuring steps. And yes, last but not least, we invested a lot of in our acquisitions with the HMI and also ZEISS last year. So all of that distorts the results quite significantly. That's why we felt this discretionary adjustment to 75% of max is justified. Now I think in hindsight, I'm even more glad that in the new policy, as of 2017, '18, '19 target period. So in 2 years to be judged the results that we changed from this return on average invested capital versus peers to an absolute target based on our long-term financial plans. That I hope will be a much clearer and easier to evaluate. Having said that, this is basically the report. Next year, of course, we will still have to live through the old system and its complications. So we'll see what other year will bring but it will not be easy again. I can already know, not promise but I expect it. Let's see. Any questions?\nExecutives: Thank you very much for the detailed explanation. Are there any questions from the audience with respect to the way the Remuneration Committee has implemented the existing policy? If not, thank you very much. All these end up with [ results ] have been crystal clear. \nI moved to point 4b. And 4b is the discussion of the board's report and also the proposal to adopt the financial statements of the company for 2017. We have an integrated report in both the financial and nonfinancial details. And again, we have 2 integrated -- we have 2 financial statements. One, based on the IFRS -- sorry, on U.S. GAAP and 1 based on the IFRS, which we use in Europe. The integrated report based on IFRS and Dutch Law is submitted to you. And you were able to take cognizance of this, to inspect it because it was available at the offices of the company and was published on our website. Mr. van Delden of KPMG is present here today, and he will give you some insight into KPMG's audit activities for us in 2017. And any questions regarding the audit may be answered by Mr. van Delden. I give the floor to your Mr. van Delden.\nAttendees: Thank you. As Mr. Kleisterlee said, indeed, 2 reports for which we issued the certificate, the U.S. GAAP and the IFRS. And it gives you some insight into the effectiveness of the -- all details. And as was mentioned the 2 different ones. And we have done the work, has resulted in a statement that says that everything was done okay. We have some 7 pages of explanations. And I'd like you to refer to that part. I would like to highlight 3 things. Of course, ASML is a global company with centralization here in Veldhoven, of much of the work, which means that the Dutch team has done the group audit mostly from the Netherlands. So the global audit was done mainly here, apart from Carl Zeiss. So because of the centralized position, we can have wide coverage. Some 90% of the assets are part of direct auditing and some 90% of the revenues we can have a review of. Our certificate also gives an insight and the key audit matters to KAM. They get special attention. We had 2, in the past year, key audit matters. And that is the revenue recognition that are major contracts that are subdivided into smaller contracts. You have to link the right amounts to the right contracts. And of course, you have to do the recognition in times, not too early, not too late but at the right time. We looked at many contracts, and we're happy with what we found. Secondly, we looked at ZEISS' major investment in the past year, a major amount, and that was one of the reasons why we looked at it in detail. It was also quite a complex contract because it is not just the investment but also in R&D corporation, so we've spent a lot of time on these 2 items, and that's all I want to say so far. Does anyone have a question on this part, this item of the agenda? And Mr. [indiscernible] has a question and the mic is handed to him by Mr. [indiscernible] so that's easy.\nAttendees: Mr. [indiscernible] says, there were legal issues and you don't say a lot about specialists. And I'd like to know a little bit more about, especially, legal specialists. And in addition to this, there is another item, another legal item which I would like you to tell me more about. Please elucidate me on this, the qualitative, quantitative side?\nExecutives: Tell me what you expect. First, if we need specialists for the audit, we employ those. And you talk about the legal issues. Of course, we talk to managements. We talk to in-house legal counsel and for any major matters we request lawyers' letters, which means that these are letters from lawyers that give an insight, we get their views. And in addition to those letters, we also spoke to external councils for major issues. And we used that input and the legal matters, the major ones, I feel, were explained properly in the financial report. Does that answer your question, sir?\nAttendees: [indiscernible]\nAttendees: The legal positions. There are 2 things you should know. First of all, you have to look at probability. Will money flow out from the company? And secondly, you have to have reliable estimations. In major cases, that is important, so we agree with the position of the management as we put forward. Yes, we agree with management. Yes, true. Yes, that is right.\nExecutives: Mr. [ Stephens ] is not audible but a mic is on its way.\nAttendees: Mr. Wennink just gave an explanation on that. I told you what we did and, of course, the outcome is never certain, but as it is included in the report as it has been explained, I think that, that is sufficient.\nExecutives: Mr. Wennink says, and I reiterate. It is more likely than not that there is going to be an obligation. If it is not probable then, that's okay, end of story. But you have to be able -- if it is the case, you have to be able to quantify it and sometimes, it cannot be quantified. It could be 0. It could be a lot that is at risk. Who knows? Because you can't tell the judge what the court is going to do. So we'll looked into the legal issues and we concluded that we do not need additional quantitative provisions. External legal counsel agrees, the auditor agrees, Mr. van Delden has just said that looking at all the facts, he agrees and that's it.\nAttendees: Yes, says Mr. Stephens, but there is case law.\nExecutives: Well, yes, but that's other cases. That is not our case. Case law is in the past. Case law is for the court to look into, but it's no help for us to quantify. Case law is in the past. Everything that we could do was made or could make available was made available to you in the annual report.\nExecutives: Yes, says Mr. Stephens. But I want to turn into a [indiscernible].\nExecutives: Well, we can't. We can't. Well, Mr. Stephens, maybe you can give us an indication of what you think it should be, but we have got no indication whatsoever. Questions in the back.\nAttendees: My name is Mr. [indiscernible]. In which countries did you actually visit? Because you said that you could assess the global situation from [indiscernible] or maybe by e-mail. But most colleagues of yours say in other AGMs what countries they actually visited. You and to [indiscernible] in Germany. I understand. What other countries were visited?\nExecutives: Well, we don't do everything by e-mail but, of course, we can look into all the global systems. And in the past year I went to Korea, I want to Taiwan, 2 of the main countries for ASML, very important countries for ASML. I spoke with local management, with local auditors. We also have obligations under the articles of association which we have to check. And it usually takes a little bit longer before we get those. So we do have a network of local auditors, but we could do most of the work ourselves. So we go to a couple of countries this year. We plan to go to China and to the United States of America.\nAttendees: André Jorna with VEB. Yes, there's been much debate about your -- well, in social interaction because you are our eyes and ears in companies. To what extent can you assure us that ASML's income statement is as it should be? Because you audited it and checked whether any money items are being shifted around? For example, earnings being transferred to a different year? And how did you do that and how did you establish that all property at present?\nAttendees: Well, we scrutinize the revenues, so revenue recognition being taking at the correct point in time is something we monitor carefully. And as for the income statement, whether the assets are present and whether the company still has sufficient earnings capacity. Of course, that's the case. As for intangibles such as goodwill and activated development costs, we look at those very carefully, too. So we think that the income sheet is as it should be. And as you see and our auditors opinion, we believe it's a true and fair view.\nAttendees: We're happy to hear that the income statement is as it should be. That comforts us and put that in writing, too. But there's a lot in writing nowadays that doesn't always turn out to be true, especially if you zoom in. As for your management letter, was it longer or shorter than it was last time?\nAttendees: I would say it was about the same length. I think some items that we identified last year have been resolved, and we discovered a few new ones. What matters most is that management follows up on this and takes it on board and they did.\nAttendees: As for the accuracy of financial reportings, the internal audits, including cybersecurity, do you have a good opinion about those as well?\nAttendees: Well, that is why we mentioned the U.S. statements where we shared concerning the financial reporting. With cybersecurity, our main role is to determine that management considers what we reported and that they also follow up with the Supervisory Board. So we see whether they follow up in sufficient manner. Thank you.\nExecutives: If there are no additional questions, then I'll hand you back to our Secretary.\nExecutives: I'll explain the voting procedure. Those of you are entitled to cast a vote at this meeting have received voting handsets and a chip card containing the data that mattered for this meeting. Please insert your smart card with the gold colored chip facing you into your keypad. Once you've inserted the smart card properly, you'll see a welcome message on the display, then you can keep that card inside your key pad during the meeting. If the smart card is not inserted properly, you'll see a warning message on the display. The moment the vote is open, you will see the option to vote on the display. Press 1 if you are voting in favor of the proposal, press 2 if you are voting against the proposal and press -- use 3 if you would like to abstain from the vote. The display will confirm your selection. You may change your selection, but once the vote is closed your final selection counts. If you have difficulty voting, please raise your hand and somebody will come to assist you. We'll try a dry run of voting based on a statement, and this statement is, \"I have visited the ASML Experience Center before. Will the voting operator please activate the system.\" Mr. Stephens has a problem.\nAttendees: Unfortunately, the speakers is inaudible. Interpreter apologizes.\nExecutives: [Foreign Language] The vote has been opened for a while. Please cast your vote.\n[Voting]\nExecutives: [Foreign Language] Most of you have already voted in this trial run. So in a few moments, I'd like to close the vote. The vote is closed, and we'll await the outcome. And I see the outcome is available and a great many of you has been there by now. Well, it's certainly a nice place.\nExecutives: [Foreign Language] I'd like to continue with the vote on agenda item 4. Please take your keypad and voting handset, and we've explained the procedure. And as soon as we open the vote, please cast your vote. Please open the vote on the agenda item 4b. Please cast your vote.\n[Voting]\nExecutives: [Foreign Language] I see that most of you have cast your vote. So I will close the vote. [Foreign Language] It's closed. [Foreign Language] See, the result is available, and I see that the proposal has been adopted. [Foreign Language]. Okay, for some reason, the percentages didn't add up, but you did see the result of the votes cast. We're delighted to see 100%, but that's not really right now. Clarification of the company's reserves and dividend policy. This is a discussion item, not a voting item, and the company aims to pay out a dividend that will be stable and to continue to grow. And for additional explanation on the dividend policy of the company, please see pages 88 and beyond of the integrated report for 2017. Are there any questions about this topic? Mr. Jorna?\nAttendees: Mr. Chairman, the share buyback from EUR 1.5 billion to EUR 2 billion, of course, we don't oppose that. The payout ratio stands at approximately 28%, which is a bit low if you compare that with others. And the question is that substantial increase is because of the increase in cash, you have a lot, so you can divert some to shareholders. That's fine. You've purchased at EUR 109 in the past, so that's a considerable profit, as well. Do you expect that given share price today and 2 weeks ago, do you expect to create value for the shareholders by repurchasing the shares? Or do you think that the share price is very high now and as for your repurchasing and timing the repurchasing, do you say we don't care with the share price is, we'll simply repurchase a chunk every quarter, or do you take direction in that?\nExecutives: I'll hand you over to our CFO, Wolfgang, for that question.\nExecutives: Thanks for your question. We have -- we apply our capital returns policy pretty consistently for 8 to 10 years now. We do foresee a split between dividends and share buybacks. The reason for that is it gives us flexibility. As you know, dividends, although we increase them all the time, is something that we do not want to take away. Even in the financial crisis in 2008 and '09, we didn't take away the dividends. But we are focused on giving money that we don't need to run the business back to shareholders. We keep sufficient cash reserves and financial flexibility also from a debt capacity, et cetera, to put investments back in the business in the form of R&D and M&A. And we're in constant contact with our shareholders on what type of returns the shareholders prefer. And as you can imagine, you ask 100 shareholders, you get different opinions. But the vast majority is agreeing with us that we keep the dividend at a manageable level, keep the flexibility by using share buybacks, and you have seen that at work in 2016, 2017. We were well advised to have a relatively lower dividend because we could cut down the share buyback program when we were buying HMI and making a major equity investment in Carl Zeiss. As it relates to the volume of the share buybacks, you could see we had a EUR 1.5 billion program for 2016/'17 that we did not exhaust. We only used EUR 900 million because of the 2 reasons I just mentioned, and we have just announced a EUR 2.5 billion program for 2018/2019. As it relates to the share price, we are not predicting the share price. We believe it's a very appropriate form of giving back money now to the shareholder and increasing the portion of the future profits to the remaining shareholders. So we have no set target price where we would start -- stop the share buyback program.\nExecutives: Thank you, Wolfgang.\nAttendees: Mr. Nickl, do you therefore believe that at this -- with this course of action you're creating value. Is the value of our company lower than the share price suggests so? Are you creating value or are you saying that's not an issue at all?\nExecutives: The a company creates value by either doing dividends or buying back shares. That's just 2 different forms of returning cash to the shareholders. The company creates value by creating an attractive product portfolio that creates a value for our customers and that increases our future cash flows. I think you can also look at the theory. There is endless debates about the mix of these 2 instruments, but I firmly believe that you don't create value by the choice of the forms how you give money back to shareholders.\nExecutives: And he is implicity saying that -- and also when you've carefully listened to what we've said on the future of this industry and the position of ASML, that it is about value creation and about growth. So in that context, I think, we have given you an indirect answer to your question.\nAttendees: Yes, I heard that, and I understand it. But what I'm actually aiming at is whether you think that ASML is worth more than the current share price?\nExecutives: Well, that's not truly our call. That's up to the market and you, as investors. And we are good at building sophisticated machines and selling them to our customers. We aim to create as much value as possible to maximize the bottom line and generate a lot of cash so that, in addition to our minimum cash, we can distribute money to shareholders. I think that's a very -- that's an excellent policy. The market is generally standing by. [ Mr. Spanier ]?\nAttendees: I'm [ Mr. Spanier ], I have a question. Unfortunately, Mr. Nickl will be leaving us. So a buyback campaign is in progress. The new CFO that remains to be appointed, I hope for her sake that she makes the grade. What instructions will she or he receive? Will that person be expected to carry out the same share buyback arrangement that Mr. Nickl devised? What will the instructions be? I think it's very simple. I certainly hope so. Yes, it is. Okay, for the time being the answer is yes. Financial policy, overall, has been devised by the CFO. Of course, as discussed and approved within the board and management, and we agree entirely, there is no change in financial policy. So as I was just saying, all cash above the minimum we need will be returned to shareholders as dividend and that is it a going but, in any case, stable dividend, and the rest is -- consist of share buyback. And I have no reason to assume that the new CFO, I know very well, is likely to change that. That was my question because you devised a certain vision together with Mr. Nickl and the supervisory board but now, you'll have a new dude in that position. Are you -- the person -- are you going to tell the new financial dude how we do it? Or will you hand that over to Mr. Kleisterlee?\nExecutives: No, I prefer to leave that to the new CFO to develop that with us, but I know the new CFO, and I'm fully confident that it will be done with good common sense and policy, so I see no reason why we should adapt to our present dividend with the policy on returning money. All I can tell you is my estimate is that any changes on our part will be extremely minimal.\nAnd I'll wrap up this agenda item and move on to adopting a dividend of 1 year of EUR 0.40 per ordinary share, because this topic has already been discussed in agenda item 2 and 4C, I'll refer to the previous debate and will now give you the opportunity to ask any additional questions should you feel such a need. If not, then I propose that we vote on the dividend proposal. The voting operator has to activate the system. Please cast your vote.\n[Voting]\nExecutives: I see that most of you have voted. I'd like to close the system in a few moments. The vote is closed and we will await the results.\nI see that the results are available and that a majority of the votes has been cast in favor of the proposal. So we note that this proposal has been adopted as well.\nOnto agenda item 5A. The proposal to discharge the members of the board of management from liability for carrying out their responsibilities in the financial year 2017. Would anybody like the floor on this? If not, we will open the vote on this proposal, as well. Mr. Secretary, with the operator, please activate the voting system. The board is open.\n[Voting]\nExecutives: I see that most of you have cast your vote. were about to close the vote. The vote is closed.\nI see the results of the vote are available over to the Chairman, now have some percentages, at least partial at some places, so we note that this proposal has been adopted.\nNext, approval of the number of shares to be allocated to the board of management -- wait a minute, 5B, the proposal to discharge the members of the supervisory board from liability. Nobody would like the floor. We'll activate the system. Open the vote with the voting -- operator, please activate the system. Please cast your vote.\n[Voting]\nExecutives: I see that most of you have already voted, so we'll be floating the vote in a few moments. The vote is closed.\nI see the results are available and a majority of the votes has been cast in favor of the proposal. Okay. So that's been adopted. Wonderful, we have approval to -- we have the approval. Now the proposal to approve the number of shares for the board of management. The ultimate allocation of shares will be done by the supervisory board based on the applicable renumeration policy by applying the calculation method as described in such policy. Furthermore, in this agenda item, it is proposed to the general meeting to designate the board of management as the body authorized to issue the aforementioned shares subject to the approval of the supervisory board. This designation is requested for the period from this meeting until the Annual General Meeting to be held in 2019. ASML has previously agreed to inform the general meeting each year about the exact number of shares granted conditionally on 19 January 2018, 43,500 -- excuse me, 43,650 shares had been granted conditionally to the current board of management, excluding the new members for the financial year 2018. The volume weighted average share price during the last quarter of the financial year 2017 equaled EUR 149.82. In connection with his intended appointment, Mr. Dassen has been granted a conditional board in 2019 for 10,000 performance-related shares. This grant is subject to the performance conditions and the 3-year vesting period. As applicable under the renumeration policy, the maximum number of shares can be -- that can be obtained are up to 20,000 performance-related shares and in 2019, the general meeting will also be informed about the number of shares granted conditionally to the board of management for the financial year 2019. Now, I'd like to open the floor to questions. Mr. Jorna?\nAttendees: Mr. Chairman, I'm Jorna from the VEB. Mr. Chairman, granting what I describe as a sign-on bonus for Mr. Dassen, we, as the -- from the VEB, object our principle. He has not done anything to earn this. It's probably compensation for what he would have received at Deloitte as a long-term incentive, and we don't see any reason to compensate him for the long-term incentive at Deloitte because it tends to be conditional and you don't know whether he achieved it. And second, you're giving a staff member a bonus to keep them over the long term within the company. If all of us agree to take over that bonus, then we'd be done and dusted, but I don't think that's the right way to deal with a long-term incentive. That's why we object our principle to a sign-on bonus. We know that, and we understand that. But the situation is a bit more subtle than that, perhaps [indiscernible] could explain why in this case the entire supervisory board supports the Renumeration Committees' conclusion that this is a good way forward.\nExecutives: I'll try explain that. Mr. Dassen, in his capacity as an employee of Deloitte received only fixed income. So no variable part. That fixed income was significantly higher than what we can offer to him. And to basically compensate him at risk because our system has a risk, as you know, STI, LTI, and it will follow the same LTI, the 10,000 shares, 20,000 maximum will follow the same LTI rules as all the other LTIs. So it can be 0, it can be 20,000, can be anything in between. So there's a risk element to it. So for get the risk, the 10,000 at target achievement on the LTI performance criteria would basically, for 3 years, roughly be equivalent to the Delta of the total direct compensation at ASML versus the fixed compensation he receive at Deloitte. That was what he felt totally reasonable and it follows performance criteria. There's no sign-on bonus guaranteed, nothing. And it basically only smoothens it for 3 years. So he has to show, of course, with his own work and performance that after that period, he either has to live with a lower salary, that's then bad luck, or achieve a higher salary because of results.\nExecutives: Thank you, Rolf-Dieter. Thank you. That's highly appreciated. [ Mr. Spanier ]?\nAnalysts: I'm [ Mr. Spanier ], I have a question. We're talking about the number of shares. Are you going to reissue the shares that you've repurchased in the previous buyback? You're not going to run the process again. And I basically object to St. Nicholas and Christmas gifts where you simply stand and wait for them. Why don't you let the person concerned work for 1 year first and then ask shareholders after 1 year -- he's been working for 1 year. Can you please have this EUR 10,000 or 10,000 shares or whatever, rather than before giving him the Santa Claus or Christmas present to unwrap before he even comes on board.\nExecutives: Well, I could go along with part of this but then say, okay, well, he will only be able to unwrap his gift after a few years of good performance. Yes, I hear you. And I think Mr. Schwalb is trying to explain this is not a Santa Claus or a Christmas gift, and that his performance shares have a 3-year vesting period. And that means performing for 3 years after which there will or will not be a payment, except for the nominal shares. It's not 1 year, it's about 3 years, and it has to be an empty [indiscernible], too. May I now open the vote on this proposal? Would the operator please activate the system? I see the system is active and you may now cast your vote.\n[Voting]\nExecutives: I see that the majority of you has cast your vote and in a few seconds, I'm going to close the vote. The vote is closed.\nAnd I see that the result is available and the majority has voted in favor of the proposal, so we note that this proposal has been adopted, as well.\nThat takes us to agenda item 7, composition of the board of management. On 12 September 2017, we announced that Wolfgang Nickl had decided, as of today's shareholders meeting, to leave at HSML -- excuse me, ASML. First, Mr. Wolfgang, we did this with the entire supervisory board yesterday evening and the board of management, you must have done this countless times within ASML. Once again, in the presence of our shareholders, we're pleased to thank you for your exceptionally valuable contribution to the growth and development of ASML. You had -- were a magnificent CFO and the Rock of Gibraltar on the management team. Thank you. And in your new role as Bayer's CFO, we wish you all the very best. It's a small world. I'm sure we'll see each other again in the future. We wish all the very best. At this agenda item, the supervisory board informs the board of management of envisaged reappointment of Peter Wennink, Martin van den Brink, Frederic Schneider-Maunoury and -- as members of the ASML board of management. The reasons for reappointing Mr. Wennink, van den Brink and Schneider-Maunoury are explained in the agenda and do not require extensive elaboration. The reappointments of Wennink, van den Brink and Schneider-Maunoury will be for a 4-year term commencing as of today. In addition, the supervisory board informs the general meeting of the envisaged appointment of Mr. Christophe Fouquet and Mr. Roger Dassen as members of the board of management at ASML. And please see the reasons for the appointment of Mr. Fouquet and Dassen in the explanatory notes. Mr. Fouquet's appointment will commence for today. Mr. Dassen's term will commence from 1 June of this year. The personal details of Mr. Wennink, Mr. van den Brink and Mr. Schneider-Maunoury, Mr. Fouquet, Mr. Dassen as well as the main elements of their respective contracts, including the renumeration package, are included in the explanatory notes to the agenda for this AGM. For the record, this is a discussion item, not a voting item. The appointment is done by the supervisory board pursuant to [indiscernible] of the company's Articles of Association. As stated, Mr. Fouquet and Mr. Dassen are present here today. Christophe Fouquet, please present yourself. And Roger, please introduce yourself, as well. Are there any questions about the above? We -- if -- Mr. Jorn, if you would bear with us for a moment.\nAttendees: I'm [ Herman Kipp ]. I'm speaking on behalf of the Foundation for Railway Pension Fund and Public Transport Pension Fund. We support the board of management comprising qualified individuals reflecting diversity, including gender. Unfortunately, the envisaged board of management is not diverse in this respect. We understand that this might be difficult because of the advanced technical expertise desired, but we wonder how ASML expects to safeguard additional gender diversity in the future board of management?\nExecutives: First, we agree with you. In searching for a new CFO, and we were involved in looking for a fellow board member, we had a long list comprising 12 candidates, including 4 ladies. In our interviews with the ladies, at first, 3 stated that they thought the company was too technical. And in our interview with one of the ladies before we were able to reach a conclusion, she withdrew from the procedure for the same reason at their own initiative. So the candidates -- among other candidates remaining, Dassen was selected. We do aim for that 1/3, but this is a highly technological company and you need to feel at ease and it's not always easy to find people. They have to be available, and they have to be at ease with the company. And the market is also restricted to Europe. We could bring people from the U.S., but we can't afford them, so that's another restriction. And apart from that, the influx in the technological positions, we do want to try that and get more female employees. We get -- we have quite a few foreign female employees but Dutch female employees lack the line. Yes, that is a good addition. In R&D, especially, some 30% -- almost 35% is female, but most of those females are from abroad, from outside the Netherlands. Mr. Jorna, your turn.\nAttendees: Thank you. Jorna, VEB. Yes, Chair, did Mr. Wennink actually say that foreign CFO cannot be -- we cannot afford this? No, no, no, not foreign, American, was said. American. So you agree with [ Mr. von Davier ] of [ ING ]? No, no, no, sir. You make a conclusion from a neutral. Mr. Wennink, I'm sure, meant to say that we do not want to have that type of -- we don't have that type of situation here. Okay, I'm happy with that. So that's fine. Two, accountants, CFO, CEO. They are not economists. Fair enough. That's good, because they always agree. So 2 accountants. Maybe that is good. And an accountant can transform into a General Manager, as Mr. Wennink has shown us. So Mr. Dassen, for his whole career has worked in accountancy. So you went from the long list to the short list. Did you actually do a kind of assessment in respect of how an accountant can manage the managerial qualities because an accountant is always right after the fact, but the manager has to also know things beforehand requires a different attitude. We do not know in how far this person will be able to manage. The due diligence of Mr. Dassen, how was this done? Who was it done with? We understand that Mr. Wennink knows him quite well. So you know what to expect from this person but was there any further due diligence before Mr. Dassen was introduced? Final question, and really, I need to say this but do not take this personally. In the claims, there had been many claims against auditors/accountants. Did you make sure that Mr. Dassen does not -- was not involved in any conflicting situations at Deloitte?\nExecutives: There was a very careful process. First of all, the committee and the full supervisory board, we looked at the profile, what kind of person do we want. Because the CFO must not just make sure that the numbers are crunched properly, but that he also can connect various parts of the company, the various people of the boards. Wolfgang did this very well, did this authentically and we wanted to keep that for the new CFO. So we had a profile drafted. We also had -- we had the long list, we went to the short list. And the whole management team, which is the whole board of management, and the Nomination Committee, we all interviewed 3 candidates. We did 4, you did 3, I think. We interviewed these people. Based on the interviews, we saw the differences in the qualities of the people, in their personalities. We looked at what could be the advantages, what could be the disadvantages, what were their strengths for ASML, what were their weaknesses for ASML. And after a very long procedure, with due care, all of us unanimously, both boards, support the appointment of Roger Dassen. And we worked with a third firm, a head hunter that did a lot of work, preliminary work, an independent firm, that headhunter, who did recommendations, who did assessments, we, ourselves, for a couple of people, who in the past worked with Roger Dassen in various positions, we got information from them directly and they made us even more enthusiastic to appoint Roger for this position.\nExecutives: And I would like to add that in the past few years, he was the Vice Chairman of a worldwide organization and that was not just being an accountant, that was managerial. So that was -- that different type of work, but also you have to look forward in that and not backward.\nExecutives: So I hope so that your questions have been answered by what we just said.\nAttendees: No, there's one question still outstanding. Who was responsible for some international parts of Deloitte? As a person, how was -- was he actually involved in any untoward business or anything that wasn't quite [ kosher ]? Well, no, we know nothing of this. And as far as we were able to check this, nothing was found that pointed in this direction. So I hereby note that, on behalf of the Supervisory Board, Mrs. -- that Mr. Fouquet was formally appointed effective April 25, 2018, and Mr. Dassen, effective 1 June, 2018. And also, Wennink, Van den Brink and Schneider-Maunoury have been appointed. So congratulations, everyone, on their reappointment and on their appointment, which brings us to the composition of the Supervisory Board, and we have 2 voting items and one discussion item.\nThe voting items concern the proposals to appoint and reappoint certain members of the Supervisory Board. And as we announced last year, Ms. Van der Meer Morh and Mr. Stork will retire their rotation per this meeting. And Mr. Van der Meer Morh has indicated that she does not wish to be reappointed and she will resign as a Supervisory Board member. And Pauline, dear Pauline, thank you so much. Yes, she is over there, all the way there. Thank you to you, too, for what you've done in the past 9 years. You were so involved, your engagement in the Supervisory Board. But you're also a member of the Selection and Nomination Committee, and you had a very important role in that, and you were also part of the Audit Committee. So thank you so much for what you did for us. And we will miss you as a person and we will miss your contribution to this Supervisory Board.\nMr. Stork indicated that he is available for reappointment, and the Supervisory Board has decided to nominate him for reappointment.\nAnd furthermore, the Supervisory Board wishes to nominate Ms. Terri Kelly as a member of the Supervisory Board. And Ms. Kelly is also here today, and the explanatory notes to the agenda contain the motivations for this nominations and the personal details of the candidates. The appointment of Ms. Kelly and reappointment of Mr. Stork will be effective this meeting and will both be for a 4-year period. The shareholders did not use their right of recommendation with respect to these vacancies.\nThe Works Council did not recommend any candidate for the vacancy, following Mr. Stork retirement per rotation. The Works Council has decided to use its enhanced recommendation right for the nomination of Ms. Kelly. And the Works Council was given timely -- was given time to give its opinion on the opportunity on the appointment and the reappointment of these 2 people. So Ms. Kelly, please, would you stand up, please. Show yourself to the meeting.\nAnd again, I give the meeting -- the opportunity to put questions, if you wish to make use of that opportunity. Yes, Mr. Davis just raised his hand. He would like to ask the question.\nAttendees: Thank you, Chairman. My name is [ Stevens ]. What about Ms. Kelly's own motivation? We'd like to hear from her. Why she wants to join the board?\nExecutives: So my history has been working for a highly technical company for the past -- last 35 years. My background is actually in mechanical engineering. I have been the CEO of that company for the past 13 years, and now stepping down. But don't want to retire, and so I'm very excited about what is happening at ASML and the technology. And also, I am very committed to the workforce and creating the right environment. And so I think it's a perfect match of where ASML is in the growth projections ahead and just where I think I can contribute. Thank you.\nExecutives: Thank you very much. With that, we are going to move to the appointment of Hans Stork.\nAttendees: [Foreign Language] Yes, the secretary will reopen the vote. And the secretary, Mr. Kleipool, says that the voting is now open, and Mr. Kleisterlee explains again that it is the proposal to report Mr. Stork as a member of the Supervisory Board for 4 years, that is being voted on at the moment. Mr. Keipool says, \"I note that most of you have, indeed, voted, so let's deactivate the voting system and you can no longer cast your votes.\" The results is available, and the chair says, \"We note that Hans has been reappointed. Congratulations. The appointment of Ms. Kelly as a member of the Supervisory Board also for 4 years.\" And the operator is asked to activate the voting system. It is now open. You may cast your votes.\n[Voting]\nExecutives: Most of you have voted. So we will close the vote. We have actually now closed the vote and the result is available.\nAttendees: [Foreign Language] The chair says that we see that the proposal has been adopted. Congratulations to the new member, Ms. Kelly.\nExecutives: The Supervisory Board advises you that by 2019, there will be various vacancies in the Supervisory Board. In 2019, myself, Kleisterlee. Ms. Aris, Mr. Schwalb and Mr. Ziebart, they will all retire by rotation, and all members are, in principle, available for reappointment. The general meeting, the AGM and Works Council have the right recommend other candidates for these vacancies. The Works Council has an enhanced recommendation right for the vacancy that will result from the retirement of Ms. Aris. And I give you now the opportunity to put questions. Mr. [ Stevens ] has just raised his hand.\nAttendees: Thank you, Chair. My name is [ Stevens ], and my organization is very much for continuity in a company. And next year, 50% of the members will retire by rotation. They are available for reappointment, you say, but things may change between now and then. What if all 4 persons say, \"No, we don't want to be reappointed. We are not available\", which would be difficult.\nAttendees: Well, \"Yes,\" says Mr. Kleisterlee, \"we said we are, in principle, available for reappointment.\" \"Well, yes\", says Mr. -- says the person. \"A lot can happen in 4 years' time. So maybe you will not have 4 people available for reappointment.\" And Mr. Kleisterlee says, \"Well, you can't change all 4 people joined on a certain date, but we'd bear this in mind, of course, because we are going to try and do this in a more staggered way in the future. So we will continue to look for enhancement of the Supervisory Board with a more staggered situation, so that we don't have the same situation that 4 people retire by rotation. So they have 4 years, first, and then 2 years for reappointment. We'll try and, as I say, stagger this a bit more, but this was created apparently at the time when we needed new blood in the Supervisory Board. There's nothing we can do about that right now at this moment.\"\nExecutives: Okay, this was a discussion item, not a voting item. So let's continue with the next item of the agenda, which is the proposal to appoint KPMG as the external auditor for 2019. As you will have read in the explanatory notes to the agenda, KPMG accountant has done the audit for 2017, and we have had an assessment of the job done and the quality, scope and planning of the audit was assessed. Pursuant to the outcome of this survey, we propose to again put KPMG as the external auditor. And therefore, the Supervisory Board, per the recommendation of the Audit Committee proposes to appoint KPMG as the company's external auditor. Would you like to ask any questions? Specific questions will be answered by Ms. [ Smiths Lusterling ], because she is the Chair of the committee. No questions? Let's vote.\nAttendees: [Foreign Language] Secretary asks the operator to activate the voting system, which is, indeed, now open.\n[Voting]\nExecutives: I can see that most of you have voted, so in a few seconds, we'll close the system, which is actually being done now. And the result is available, so I give the floor to the chair.\nAttendees: Who says that, \"This item was adopted, and we continue with Item 10 on the agenda, which comprises Items A, B, C and D, and we will vote on each of these items. It is an annually recurring item of the agenda, but an important one. And it is in the company's interest, and that of you, the shareholders, to be able to react quickly if particular circumstances arise for which an issue of shares is required. Therefore, the Board of Management would like to be able to issue shares when such circumstances, indeed, arise and exclude the preemption right where it is necessary to act quickly. And as an example, in [ 2020 ], we use this authorization for the acquisition of Cymer, and in 2016, for the acquisition of Hermes Microvision. It was also used for the issue of convertible bonds in the past. And the authorizations to be granted will be valid for 18 months, from today until 25 October, 2019. If you do adopt the proposals of this agenda item, the existing authorizations will expire. 10A is the authorization of the Board of Management to issue ordinary shares or to grant rights to subscribe for ordinary shares in the company's share capital, for general purposes. Limited to 5% of the issued share capital at the time of authorization and, of course, subject to Supervisory Board's approval. Item 10B is the authorization of the board of management to restrict or even exclude the preemption rights that are accrued to shareholders in connection with 10A of the Agenda. And this also subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board.\nAfter this, we'll continue with 10C, which is the authorization of the Board of Management as the body to issue shares or grant rights to subscribe for shares for an additional 5% of the current share capital of the company, also subject to Supervisory Board approval. And this additional 5% can only be used on the occasion of mergers, acquisitions and/or strategic alliances. And then finally, we have Item 10D. Again, this is an authorization for the Board of Management and, in this case, it is to restrict or exclude the preemption rights accruing to shareholders in connection with the issue of shares or rights to subscribe for shares, as described on 10C. And as with the other items, this is subject to Supervisory Board approval. Nobody wishes to take the floor, so let's start voting 10A. You may now cast your votes.\"\n[Voting]\nExecutives: As the majority of votes have been cast, the system will soon close. Yes, you can no longer cast your votes, and we see that a majority has voted in favor. So we can continue with 10-B. And again, the operator activates the system. Please cast your votes.\n[Voting]\nExecutives: As most of you have voted, we will close the vote in a few seconds. Yes, we've got the results. We can see that this item was also adopted. 10-C is now to be voted on and the same procedure applies.\n[Voting]\nExecutives: Yes. We close the vote as the majority of votes have been already cast. You can no longer vote. The result is available. And the majority -- a majority of votes was casted in favor. Final item of the 10 is D. Please vote on D.\n[Voting]\nExecutives: We will soon see the result on the screen after the vote has been closed. And a majority of votes was cast in favor, so this proposal has also been adopted. Agenda Items 11 and 12, the authorization to acquire and cancel ordinary shares, and this is because of the flexibility for the return of capital to the shareholders. Such flexibility requires a mandate for further share buybacks and to adopt further cancellation of shares should the company decide to do so. And as you will understand, this depends on various factors, and you are advised that there is no certainty as to further return of capital or as to the timing of another potential distribution, nor as how to achieve such distribution, and this was already addressed on the agenda Item 2. I will deal with these 2 items, 11 and 12, separately.\n11 is the proposal to authorize the board of management to acquire ordinary shares, a max of 10%, that is, and subject to Supervisory Board approval. We have listed their conditions in the explanatory notes, and that was Agenda 11. Agenda Item 11A and 11B is for a further maximum 10% with additional conditions as set out in the explanatory notes to the agenda. And the reason why we ask this additional authorization is for further flexibility in the execution of a distribution of capital to you, the shareholders. And these authorizations are requested for 18 months, from today until 25 October 2019. If you do adopt these 2 proposals, the existing authorizations will expire. And I see that nobody has a question, so let's vote on 11A, which is the authorization to repurchase up to 10% max of the issued share capital. Voting is now open.\n[Voting]\nExecutives: [Foreign Language] We are ready to show the result on the screen, and it was adopted. This item next, 11B, that is the additional repurchasing of -- or repurchasing of an additional 10% of the issued share capital. We will now vote on this.\n[Voting]\nExecutives: You can no longer cast your votes, and the result is available.\nAttendees: And the chair says, \"We see that this was adopted. Agenda Item 12 is a proposal to cancel ordinary shares, and that may be done in one or more parcels or blocks. And the number of shares to be canceled will be determined by the Board of Management, but will never exceed 20% of the issued share capital as today. No questions? Please vote on Item 12 on the agenda.\n[Voting]\nExecutives: [Foreign Language] The vote is closed now and the results are available.\nAttendees: And the chair says that this was adopted. \"Agenda Item 12, which brings us to any other business. Does anyone have any questions that you wish to put?\" And Mr [indiscernible] just raised his hand.\nAttendees: Mr. Chair, my name is [indiscernible]. I have a question. 5G, 5G for the telecommunications industry. Do you see that other companies want more machines because 5G, the drones will be able to communicate, and they cannot do that with the use of 4G. So maybe you already have a higher demand? Whether you can deliver machines at a certain time that are kind of 5G-compliant or something?\nExecutives: Well, quick answer. It is an improvement of the 4G technology and there is a very limited number of applications for 5G at this stage, and there's hardly a business case. There will be one, but it will take a while, but it will be of no significance to ASML.\nAttendees: Chair. My name is [indiscernible]. I have a question -- well, actually, a remark. Big Data, this afternoon, it was mentioned, there's a -- it's important in today's world. Major companies, Apple, Facebook deal with Big Data. Some 80% to 70% of all Big Data is in their hands. Big Data multiply and distort one another. It plays a big role in the holistic chain. Continuously, deviations are being monitors -- monitored to correct the precision of this. In this chain, a lot of data are stored on lots of things. My question is, what about how do you control these Big Data within the company? I have another example. You have a lot of suppliers, some-100 suppliers, more than 100 suppliers. Some also are involved in research for the next generation, a lot of data. And these are not the data that we used to have, the drawings and the plans that you can file. So tell me a little bit more about this. Do you have a designated department or will you set up a designated department for Big Data? It is an issue in the world. And Oxford and Cambridge are specialized, and they warn us about this topic.\nExecutives: Okay. Big Data, there's a live talk about Big Data. And of course, that's a hot topic that encompasses quite a few ideas. You're addressing very -- 2 very specific aspects in ASML where we deal with the data transactions, gathering and using it in our machines. I think you could say something about that [ Martin], but the very simple answer is it's completely screened from any external disclosure. Is it one department that deals with everything overall? No, it's single policy. Until recently, dealing with these large data files was very specific, but at our initiative, it's turn -- been merged into one department that handles the Big Data Lake in a standardized manner. Now a few comments about the machine. We have extensive access to the machine production data. Theoretically, we even have access to the chip design, so that we can optimize the chip. Now as for how we deal with the sensitive data, the main issue is that -- with the customers, and there's a company that is still manufacturing chips for others and wants to keep all the technology internal. We design the tools to optimize this, but the data remains in the factory. And to the extent that data is necessary to run our machines, we have very specific agreements on data access, and they certainly don't consider chip layout or the wafers where it's manufactured.\nAttendees: So might it be a good idea to address this in a subsequent annual report so Big Data and how you deal with it? Or did I not read the report in detail and is it already there?\nExecutives: I don't believe that you didn't read enough our Annual Report. Yes, that's part of our entire strategic decision-making process. You're entirely right. The party that holds the data, holds the value, and that's the truth, but our data is far from straightforward. And in the years ahead, we'll certainly have to explore that with the large platform. They always call them the Googles and the Amazons in this world. I'm sure quite a bit that, whatever will under the bridge before, it's clear exactly how that needs to be dealt with and it's also a social issue. What about our service engineers, the application engineers that work together with customers? They often have no access to data from outside the factory. They have to be in the data room itself to help optimize.\nAttendees: [The operator says the question was inaudible and  answer is \"Absolutely, thank you.\"]\nShareholders: Thank you. Good afternoon, I'm Mr. [indiscernible], I've been a shareholder since 2001. I am very, very happy. First, like last year, I'd like to thank Mrs. van de Kerkhof again. And it seems to be increasingly difficult to attend this meeting, but Mrs. van de Kerkhof arranged it once again. Do I understand that Intel holds only 3% of the share and Samsung is out of the picture?\nExecutives: No, not Samsung. They still have some shares.\nShareholders: And we've had this debate in the past, too. I didn't understand it at that time, perhaps Mr. Wennink can explain to me once again why he is opposed to a stock dividend. That was my impression.\nExecutives: Well, yes. I've -- I get that question a lot. The stock dividend and the share premium is -- could be a very attractive option for private investors in The Netherlands. But institutionally, it doesn't really matter, because it's mainly pension funds that want the cash dividend and if you would issue it in shares, then they have to sell it, and that cause many efforts. So it's more convenient for them to receive it in cash. 96% of our shareholders are institutional investors, so it's quite a hassle and they don't really want to deal with the hassle. Yes, but then [ Phillips ] does it by default, and Shell started doing it again in the past 2 years, and it certainly adds up. But these are shares that have been traditionally very popular among retail investors, and that's not the case in our company. So it's not attractive to you, and there's only 4% there anyway or even less. \n[Foreign Language] If there are no other questions, I'd like to thank you for coming and for your interest and for your questions. And I'm closing this meeting and invite you for snacks and beverages in the lobby outside. Thank you.\nExecutives: Before we open the official meeting, I have a few general announcements. First, please switch off your cell phone. Part of this meeting will be conducted in English, and we have interpreters for those who don't understand English, and they will interpret the English section. You can listen to the interpretation by the headset you received. This translation of the meeting is also available via the headphones. Microphones are available in this room. If you would like the floor, please state your name briefly and ask to keep your questions short and snappy. And I would -- for due procedure in the meeting, I may need to curtail speaking tongue or the number of questions. \nI hereby open the ASML Holding N.V. Annual General Meeting and welcome you as our shareholders.\nI'm going to introduce the members of the board of management. Mr. Wennink; Mr. van den Brink; and Mr. Nickl, seated next to me. And then Mr. van Hout; and Schneider-Maunoury on the front row. Also, the members of the Supervisory Board include the ladies [indiscernible] and [indiscernible]; and the Messrs.  Grose, Schwalb and [indiscernible]. Messrs. Smits-Nusteling, Mr. [ Grose ] and Mr. Schwalb are to my right on the stage and I'm also pleased to welcome Mrs. Kelly, whose appointment to the Supervisory Board is an agenda item at this meeting.  I'm also pleased to welcome Messrs. Dassen and Fouquet, whose appointment as members of the board of management of ASML will be discussed at this meeting. \nThe general meeting has been convened with due observance of ASML's Articles of Association of Dutch law and the meeting will be transmitted live via audio webcast and audio recording will be made of the meeting to draft the minutes.\nMr. Reinier Kleipool will serve as secretary to this meeting. He's a candidate civil law notary at De Brauw Blackstone Westbroek. The details of the registration for this meeting are currently being processed. Before we vote, Mr. Kleipool will report how many people are present here as shareholders or proxy holders and how many votes may be cast. Mr. Kleipool will also explain the voting procedure and will perform a test run. And he will guide the voting procedure during the meeting.\nPursuant to the provisions of the corporate governance code, the external auditor ASML KPMG is present today. On behalf of KPMG, we have Mr. [ Van Delden ] present. He will be able to answer your questions concerning the audit report on the ASML financial statements for 2017.\nNow on to agenda item 2, which is a review of the operations, the financials and the corporate social responsibility activities of the firm. And I'm pleased to hand you over to Mr. Wennink.\nExecutives: Thank you. I'd like to review 2017 rapidly with you. Of course, you've seen the financial statements. They're not very detailed. \n2017 was an excellent year, the best year in the company's history. Revenue exceeded EUR 9 billion. So net sales grew by 33% and there was a gross margin of 45%. And that was also a record annual margin. Net income grew 44% to exceed EUR 2 billion. And our earnings per share equaled EUR 4.93, that's nearly EUR 5 per share.\nIn addition, and this is important, our share in installed base services grew. Those are the services and the physical upgrade of our installed base in the field. So it grew -- that share grew by about 25% to a record EUR 2.7 billion. \nWe are the most rapidly growing section in the company aside from EUV. Now on the subject of EUV, last year, we revealed a capability of 125 wafers per hour as we indicated in the Q1 results. We had the strength of the lighting source at a level that we can generate a minimum of 125 wafers per hour. But now we're focusing on that machine's availability to minimize downtime because that machine still has some growing pains and teething troubles. But we'll talk about that and we'll work them out too, we'll resolve them.\nNow Deep UV is our bread-and-butter product. That's how we earn our daily bread. Last year, that reflected a 21% increase from 2016 and their Holistic Lithography, that we'll touch on later on, is also pivotal in a rapidly growing company. As for 2017, that was an important year. We reached an important strategic agreement with our partner, Tran Zeiss, and -- Carl Zeiss, excuse me, and that division is -- it's a truly symbiotic relationship with our partner Carl Zeiss. And that's very important because it reinforces this strategic partnership and provides a foundation for research and development procedure for the next generation of EUV machines, which will be toward the middle of the decade ahead. \nBut we received our first commissions for research and development, and those R&D systems will be -- we'll start shipping those at the end of 2021 and then continuing in 2022 and what we call the early systems will start in 2023 and '24, ramping up in the next decade so that technology will take us past the end of the next decade.\nNow capital return, last year, we returned about EUR 1 billion to shareholders, about half through dividends and half through share buybacks so that the number of shares in issue is declining. And given the share earnings ratio, it impacts the share price on the stock exchange.\nNow as for EUV, what do customers care about? They've indicated that in 2017, in Q1 2018, they've expressed confidence in EUV, and that's [ indispensable ] of the next generations of advanced chips. We received 9 orders for the -- for Q1 and completed -- we've got about 36 EUV systems in our order portfolio. In 2017, we broke EUR 1 billion in sales for the first time, and we're planning about 20 systems for this year. Our capacity is 30 systems in 2019.\nNow what matters in EUV at present? Not so much the technological question as to does it work? It works as proven by all the orders that our customers have placed with us. So it also means this is the new technology. But we have to make sure that these teething troubles that are ongoing concerning the shelf life of certain parts, it -- we need to maximize the availability of the machines for those customers. So our target is to get availability above 90%. That concerns our Deep UV systems. And in the years ahead, we want to ensure that Deep UV machines can be used with the same -- the EUV machines need to be used with the same intensity as Deep UV machines, and that means that we are ready for industrialization. We can take them industrial and have some technical milestones from last year. \nProductivity exceeded 125 wafers per hour. We've got the pellicle, that's a membrane that we attach to the photo, negative of the photomask, to avoid pollution on the mask. There was a technological issue as to whether we were capable of applying such an extremely thin membrane, such an extremely thin pellicle and it all worked. And what's also important, because the EUV doesn't work in isolation, it works together with DPV systems. And if used them together, you can make chips so that the 2 technologies align in a matched overlay. And then they work together so that the positioning accuracy of it, Deep UV machine and an EUV machine if you use 1 after the other, it's accurate to less than 1 -- 2 millionth of a millimeter. So that's very accurate usage. \nNow our product strategy. If you considered ASML 5 or 10 years ago, we did only that huge scanner in a photocopying machine. But over time, we've added many new products. And you see this holistic lithography triad. We built this projection machine. But a few years ago, we started thinking about improving the process range because you need a photo negative to use it in that appropriate -- the dedicated machine. And we call that the process scope. We call it the process window. And that helps us improve the print for our customers. And it was about 15 years -- no, nearly 20 years ago when we started this. And we took the first steps. And later on, we purchased a company such as Brion that was nearly 10 years ago.\nAnd if you know what this photo negative should look like to get the optimal print, then you want to know whether it actually works that way. So you need a way to control that process window and we thought of measurement systems, that's the YieldStar that was developed by ASML. And in 2016, we also purchased HMI, that's a Taiwanese company that develops inspection equipment to see whether the machine actually does what we think it does. And once you know that, then you can also use the measurement and inspection data to improve the process window. So then you bring that data back to the potential chip design and toward the machine because there are thousands of knobs on that machine to change settings. So there's a feedback loop to support customers in that increasing complexity that we see in the chip industry where everything becomes tinier. And this exponentially enhances calculation, power and the storage capacity. The advanced chips keep improving, but it's also increasingly complex. So to be certain that the design will end up on the chip and that we can quickly correct any defects we observe, it's very important to optimize the output. \nOver time, we have transitioned from building large cameras in photocopying machines to supplying process solutions. And that's what you see here. In 2016, we purchased HMI. And in 2017, we had the first combined machine integrating ASML technology with the HMI technology. So we've come full circle. And the first machine shipped at the end of 2017. \nNow what does this mean? We call it a holistic lithography that should -- so not just the printer, it's knowledge about the photo negative and the photomask and the measurement and inspection equipment and how they all interact. So it's holistic vision of how customers should use the tiniest little membrane on the chip. So that means that the YieldStar machine can exist alongside the HMI machine together with a Deep UV and the EUV machine. And they interact perfectly. And this is particularly important when we head to the next generation of chips. The most advanced chip now has the smallest measurement of 10 nanometers. And you can get it from 3 to 7 to 2. \nNow who are we doing this?  Of course, with our customers and with our people, our employees. One of the challenges is to keep employment up and keep the right people. \nNow if you've read the newspapers, you'll see that ASML is certainly drawing attention from qualified engineers, and our HR division processes over 1,000 applications a year. And we do need 100,000 people. But our international contingent is increasing because there simply aren't enough people in the Netherlands. We have over 100 nationalities working in this campus in Veldhoven.  At the end of the year, we had 19,200 people and 700 people came from the HMI acquisition. But at the end of Q1 2018, we're already up to 20,200 people. So that means we've added 1,000 employees. \nHow do you find them? That's a serious challenge and Sebastian was the 10,000th working in Eindhoven. You see this in the Eindhoven Daily. So that half people -- half the people work in Veldhoven and the other half work abroad. Divide that equally between Asia and the United States. \nNow let's talk about the financials. I also mention those because we are going to talk about the financial statements. As I said, 33% growth in net sales in 2017, what we call base management. So that's tending to the machines in the field, not just servicing them but also upgrading them to the next generation. Well, that's growing at pace from 1.1 million to nearly 2.7 million -- from EUR 2.1 billion to nearly EUR 2.7 billion. And we see that in absolute terms, we still have excellent revenues. But in the memory chips, we see a lot of growth in that market. \nThe market has nearly doubled and that growth is continuing. We all deal with that. And you, your children and your grandchildren will all be using the cloud. You already use it. So there are a great many data solutions and software solutions that are no longer on your PC or your tablet, no. They're basically driven and managed and processed in the cloud through huge data centers. And that means that the huge data supply needs to be processed very quickly. So demand for what we call high-power computing. \nSo systems where the chips have a fantastic computational power, that needs to be nurtured and supported by a very powerful operating memory and storage capacity because all those data need to be stored in the cloud that we want to obtain it from later on. So you need to see the cloud applications in terms of artificial intelligence, self-driving cars, virtual reality, and the traditional communication through a smartphone, your PC. Everything is driven by that cloud. So that means -- that means that the sophisticated powerful computation chips are not possible unless they're supported by very powerful memory chips. \nSo whereas in the past the memory chips market was not growing very quickly. With the advance of the cloud, you see a massive rise in these sophisticated memory chips. You saw that in 2017 and it's continuing in 2018.\nNow as for the figures, 33% top line growth, 45% gross earnings margin. That's good. And this margin takes into account that we're not really making a lot of money on EUV yet in 2017. It's even slightly negative. And of course, that depresses the gross earnings margin. But we went from -- it went from EUR 300 million to EUR 1.1 billion at a low margin, but we managed to increase that margin because the rest of the company is operating more efficiently. \nAs for the EUV margin, we are fully confident as we indicated that by 2020, it will be between 35% and 40%. 40% is a nice target, and it's a viable target. Why? Because the EUV systems, if you look outside, you see a huge factory. And last year only a few systems came from that factory. But we can get about 45 systems from them. So you can compute those fixed costs. If you have 12 systems, then the fixed -- the overhead is very high. But if you have 45, you'll have a much lower overhead. \nIn addition, by 2020, we'll have a learning curve so we'll be cutting costs. And that will also manifest. We have other more productive EUV systems, so they're more valuable. That's the third reason. And keep in mind, we have service organization, very complex machines that require dozens of people to service it.\nAnd then there's infrastructure that we need to assemble in the field. We're incurring those costs now. And the warranty period on those machines is still pending. But by 2020, they'll no longer be covered by the warranty. So if you add all of this, there's little doubt that by 2020, we'll have a margin between 35% and 40%. And compared with the projected margin for the company as a whole, that will exceed 50%.\nNow net result, one more point, R&D costs, they increased by EUR 160 million. And we envisage that same increase in 2018 when we head to the next EUV generation. First, we'll spend on R&D both at ASML and ZEISS, which we largely finance. So that will keep rising. But the top line for 2018 will be up as well due to the reasons I just told you about.\nNet income is up 44% to -- it exceeds EUR 2 billion, and as I mentioned, nearly EUR 5 per share in earnings.  Bookings value was over EUR 9 billion last year at the end of Q1. I'm sure that you can do the numbers yourself, at nearly EUR 7 billion for order portfolio at the end of Q1. So things are looking good in this company. \nNow as for cash flow, what are we doing with those earnings? At present, we have what we call free cash flow that's after all the investments and settling the financing transactions and after we invest the cash from the earnings into working capital, we have about 7% of the net earnings. That's not where we want to be, we'd like a bit more. But that's the way things are because we're accumulating working capital for the EUV ramp. That's going to cost a lot of money. And in 2017 we invested EUR 1 billion in our Carl Zeiss venture. \nAnd looking at the balance sheet, we see equity method investments. As said, that's nearly EUR 1 billion, that's Carl Zeiss. It's well-financed -- very solvent company. So we can fund that growth and cover the R&D expenses and make the necessary investments to grow that company further. \nNow as for the shareholders, last year, about EUR 1 billion was returned to the shareholders. About 0.5 million was paid in dividend -- excuse me, EUR 0.5 billion was paid in dividend and EUR 0.5 billion was paid in shares. But we had to wait until we made that payment to ZEISS. And after we did that, we resumed the share buyback. We proposed increasing the dividend to EUR 1.40. We'll talk about that later on. \nWe've also announced a new share buyback program to the tune of EUR 2.5 billion, of which the first buyback was achieved in Q1 2018 and that will continue in the quarters ahead. \nNow I'll briefly result -- I'll briefly summarize the Q1 results. The Q1 was fine, it was just above the market guidance we had set to -- we achieved EUR 2.2 billion. The gross margin was high because we booked little EUV sales in Q1. In Q2, we expect more. And the operating margin was 28%. That was looking good. And quite a good order intake to the tune of EUR 2.4 billion. \nNow outlook for Q2, we see that net sales are expected to increase to EUR 2.5 billion to EUR 2.6 billion comprising EUR 600 million for EUV. That's considerably more than in Q1 at a lower margin. The margin is in the black, but it's not the same as the Deep UV margin, and it certainly impacts gross earnings. But that will settle up in the rest of the year. So we're not worried about the gross earnings percentage for 2018. We'll get there. \nR&D costs will rise a bit because we had those next-generation orders. Those systems will cost EUR 270 million each. We've received 4 orders and we purchased 8 options on early volume systems, all yielding a potential EUR 1.5 billion cash flow. If you receive the money in the bank, that's great, but you have to work to get there. So that's why our R&D costs will take us to the next level. We're both in Veldhoven and in Germany at Carl Zeiss. We'll make our first investments.\nNow here's my last slide. Corporate governance code from 2016 was implemented as of 1 January 2017. We are entirely compliant with this code. In our view, we performed a complete review of our corporate governance structure, not only the structure, also the internal processes. And we reviewed the agreements that we reached about rules for the board of management and the Supervisory Board. We've amended those to comply with the new corporate governance legislation. And as you would expect from us, we're particularly focused on being in compliance with the applicable rules of good corporate governance. \nAnd I'd like to wrap up on this note. Gerhard will move on to the next item.\nExecutives: Fine, which brings me to you people who are here in the room. You may have some questions. And I see that Mr. Stevens has raised his hand.\nExecutives: Let's get a mic to Mr. Stevens. All the way from the back the mic comes to Mr. Stevens.\nAttendees: Mr. Stevens with the association to protect the rights of the shareholders. You've said quite a few things already about the cash flow, about results. We have a different computational method these days, and through that method, we find out that your capacity to earn back the money is quite weak. And we looked into this a bit further, and we found out what you already said, too. The new machines have a lower profit margin. And then if we look at the market, at the market for chips, and we see that there is a lower demand for smartphones, there are more chips for crypto and for artificial intelligence, supercomputers, the Internet of Things. Okay, if we look even deeper than this, we see that in the next generation machines coming up in possibly the next decade, but if you have a lower profit margin, if that is reduced, you will have to get the money to develop the new machines from the cash flow. And we'd like you to tell us a little bit more about this. Let's explain that a little bit further, please. And something else that we noted, the intangible assets, that is 60% approximately of the book value, which we feel, well, that's quite a bit, isn't it? And then let's continue with something else that you mentioned, the 80% you mentioned. Could this harm the company? Because there is less faith in the company. How do you manage this? [ It is not quite clear what Mr. Stevens means by the 80% ]. You said it's okay but that is what you say. But what does the market think? Legal disputes at the level at which you operate, you will have those legal disputes, of course. And they will be lengthy ones, no doubt. But we ask you to tell us a little bit more about the dispute that you have at ZEISS, you and ZEISS with Nikon. That has been ongoing for a while. And for us outsiders, we just read a little bit about this and hear a little bit about this, but it is very hard for us with a little bit of knowledge to assess how that is going. \nNationalities, you mentioned the number of nationalities of the employees. Well, you have mentioned that. And then maybe people do not understand one another, all those nationalities. Do you have particular people that you employ who are designated to make sure that everybody understands everything, that people work well together and that there is no conflict between people who work here? These are our questions for the time being. Thank you.\nExecutives: Thank you and Mr. Wennink is going to answer the questions.\nExecutives: Mr. Stevens, thank you so much for the context of the market. But you've already said it. I said it. We have no concerns about the market nor the market growth. Smartphones have shown single-digit growth in the past couple of years. The double-figure growth of smartphones was years ago. But it's not just the smartphones, mind you. It is also the Internet, the cloud, the cryptocurrencies, the artificial intelligence, the autonomous cars. It's all of that. It is to that window of the advanced chips, that scope, that range is becoming broader. So the demand is also increasing. And you will not be surprised to know that we have very good expectations for the growth with that potential of this company. And we have no worries to be able to earn back the investment as you will have seen and have seen in the past years. It will not stop at 2017. The profit margins of the new machines, okay, good question. You want to know more about this? I already indicated the profit margins, how we wish to get those at the required levels for the current machines. And the new machines, yes, as you said, much will have to be invested in that. But we no longer have to invest in the EUV light source. The light source was our problem. That used to be a problem but we will use the same light source. By mid-next decade, we'll have a much higher reliability than we have now. Because we have learned in addition to which we have agreements with Carl Zeiss, as mentioned. A part of their capital goods are funded, quite a big part of it. And we will get that money back. We'll get that back because we consider these 2 companies 1 business which mean that we have agreed that we are entitled to a certain return on our investments, and that return will be paid back through a lower price that we have to pay for the lenses. So for the next-generation EUV lenses, when we get those, we'll have huge mark down as a result of our investment.  So the profit margins for the new machines will be considerably better initially than those for the current EUV. So the light source is the result -- is the reason for that because we've learned and the lens price will have been adapted because of that requirement of a return on our investment. So I do believe that the cash flow, free cash flow will be able to finance this, especially because our market is growing, and we have no doubt, nor do our clients have any doubt because of course there is a reason why they've already placed the orders that they have placed. They have good faith in us. There is EUR 1.5 billion on their way from their bank accounts to ours. So they must have some faith. Yes, the immaterial assets, the 60% you mentioned, yes, true, it is 60%. And it has to come from our own equity and then you have the corrections on both sides of the balance sheet. So there's sufficient solvency, no worries. Availability of the machines, that is quite right. The Deep EUV (sic) [ Deep UV ] machine does work technically. It's not been industrialized yet. A lot of work has to be done yet because of the shelf life of the elements, the parts. If you use it for a long time, will it still have the same quality? And we have that learning curve all the time, in all transitions. We have a very detailed plan. The -- to get the availability of the machine up from the 80% you mentioned to 90%. So we have a lot of projects that are concurrent. Thousands of people are working on that in addition to our client because, of course, the client wants to use this as much as possible. So the 80% availability, we know where we stand, we know where we wish to stand. And especially in the past couple of months, the last -- the most recent quarter, there were some breakthroughs regarding the reliability of the EUV light source. We had some concerns on the mirror that catches the light, whether the shelf life would be such that it would be attractive for customers. But as I said, we had quite a few breakthroughs, and we have all faced that we can have a 90-plus percent availability. \nNext, the legal disputes that you mentioned. That has already been explained before in the financial statements. It is not uncommon, as you said, in our industry to have this type of dispute. We had Qualcomm and Apple and Samsung, and of course, tens or dozens of thousands of patents are filed by these major companies. And of course, after a while, people don't quite agree or companies don't quite agree. And these are very lengthy proceedings on very complex technology. Yes, and there is litigation and we will explain to the court that we are not worried about the validity of our patents, that they are ours, that they are unique. And we enter the battle. And of course, we have to wait and see whether the court agrees with our point of view. We do feel, of course, that the court will agree, but we'll have to wait and see. We cannot say anything else. I haven't got a crystal ball. I cannot tell you what will happen in the future. \nThen all those nationalities in our company. Yes, quite a valid commentary. They have to work together, even though they come from all corners of the world. So 80% or 85% of our staff are university-educated. And especially people who work in that field and who come from universities from across the world, they mainly speak English. Sometimes I have meetings, lunches with new staff members who join us, and their command of the English language is very good. They have an excellent command of the English language. So we speak mainly English in this company. That is the common language that we use. And it's not so much the language that is the issue, but the way of working. So we have special programs to make sure that the new hires are given a buddy, a buddy who shows them what the procedures are, what the system is, give them an explanation on what is expected from the new hires. There is transparency about the type of work they have to do and how this contributes to the work that others do. We pay a lot of attention to this. You are quite right if you don't do this, people just run around not knowing where to go. So that does have our special attention. And in the meeting that we had with the Supervisory Board, it was discussed at length, too. So yes, for that point, thank you. There's a lot of attention for this.\nExecutives: Thank you. Anyone else? On the left-hand side here.\nAttendees: [indiscernible] is my name. My compliments for your results and also for the annual report. I have some minor questions. First of all, the transition to 7 nanometers and beyond, do you agree, sir, that the total market worldwide, I think it is from 35 billion up to maybe 50 billion, and I hear reports on the intensity. They feel that it is higher than the lithography intensity of this market. But I'd like your opinion on this, sir. And the second question is something that you already mentioned. In 10 to 12 years, there's a transition to 2 nanometers. And then we get to the post-optics era. I do not know whether you're already doing any R&D into the post-optics era, but what I want to ask is what do you think of the long-term outlook with regards to those post optics. \nGross margin, 49% in Q1. So that's a wonderful result. So not just for the more modern tools but the old-fashioned tools. So high 40s, low 50s. When do you expect those for the EUV? And the final question is the innovation box. For taxes, the fiscal, how do you see the development regarding that, the taxes that need to be paid in the future? Those are my 4 questions.\nExecutives: Okay, the questions will be answered, 3 and 4 by Wolfgang. I will answer 1 and somebody else will answer question 2. The world fab-equipment market to make the chips, yes, indeed, some 50 billion, quite a considerable growth. Do bear in mind that the sales of our top line clients also had turbulent growth. And we are in a period if you look at the market in which we operate, and we have to subdivide this into 3 segments: the logic, the memory chips, which is -- which supports the logic, DRAM, and the NAND chips, the storage chips for storage of data. So those 3, you have to break it down into these 3.  And all 3 submarkets are hot, which has to do with the cloud, the Internet of Things, those developments. But if we look at the third segment, the NAND, the storage chips so to speak, we progress to a new technology. The number of bits on those is determined by the number of layers. And those layers, for that you need deposition, you need etching. And every layer has deposition step and an etching step, which means that you have to have the pattern, you need lithography parts, that storage chips is -- we have some colleagues in that market. Relatively speaking, they benefit a lot from that market. So that litho intensity as a percentage of the total CapEx, which is the money spent on this equipment, decreases. It goes down. But in absolute terms, lithography does not go down. Because if you go to all -- to the multilayer strategy, you need more deposition, you need more etch. So that's good for our colleagues. And DRAM and in logic, it's a different situation because, in those 2 segments, we have to deal with -- we have very complex designs, especially in logic, random, very complex layer of the chips, sometimes 3, 4, 5, 6 times it has to go through the machine just for 1 layer and EUV makes this very simply. We can just do it in 1 step. But if you have to do it 5 to 6 times, then you also have to have the 5 to 6 times deposition layer, etching layer. So good for our colleagues once more. But if we reduce those 5 to 6 layers to 1 and we do it through EUV machine, which is double the price, then the relative share of the EUV machine or if the lithography goes up as a part of the total costs then our colleagues go down. So you see the opposite happen, not just for logic but also for DRAM. So what you have to do, you have to look at those market segments, and in certain segments of the market, litho intensity increases and then in the other markets, there is a relatively -- a relative downturn. But overall, because DRAM and logic is the bigger part of the market, the litho intensity will increase. Thank you.\nExecutives: The post optics well, I'm very happy with the HMI orders. I'm very happy with those. So the bandwidth is different. I am -- I will function or operate until the next decade. You talk about 2 nanometers. Where do we stand today? If you buy an advanced Apple phone, there are 10 nanometers chips in there. And -- which the new technology, we feel that it is usable at 1 nanometer. Now we may speculate 10 years ahead. What could happen after 1 nanometer? But there are lots of questions. So let me not go into that right now. We are now into expanding the current EUV machines. And in the short term, as Peter says, it will simplify the processing. And that will be soon 5 to 3 nanometers. And there'll be a situation in which we will have various exposures, double patterning, which will result in more process steps, higher costs [indiscernible] through the HMA, it will go down, and there will be a new situation. And what happens after, well, I can't really tell you yet. Maybe we can talk about this sometime in the near future. But what is important over the next decade is the number of layers, the number of exposures that is required will have the imaging done with a lower resolution and will have to have a higher throughput. Those are the main things for the next decade. And this should be right, together with some processing tricks to get up to the required nanometer level. Costs, Wolfgang, EUV margin tax burden, the innovation box.\nExecutives: The gross margin and innovation box as well. Gross margin, I'll repeat part of what Peter already said. There is a big difference between our EUV business currently, although we make great progress year-over-year, and the rest of our business. So in a given quarter, you can have quite some churn. Like for instance, in Q2, we'll ship -- we'll have almost 4x the revenue in EUV than we have in Q1 and you can see we've gone from 49%, almost 49% to 43%. That will level itself out throughout the year. We've said publicly that this year, although we haven't given a specific number, that the overall company gross margin will progress from the 45% that we achieved last year, despite the fact that the EUV business is doubling in size again. So that, of course, shows that we're making progress in EUV. And we talk a lot about EUV, but we also continue to create a lot of value in the non-EUV business.  It's often forgotten that half of our R&D budget goes to non-EUV products, Deep UV, Holistic Lithography and so forth. And we continue to create value there and we share that with the customer. But we have the opportunity to increase the margins there as well. We've spelled out quite specifically, and Peter mentioned the 4 criteria: volume, cost, mix and then the service business, how we get in the zip code of 40% gross margin by 2020, I think it's very feasible if we achieve the volumes and the tool does what it's supposed to do. That's very feasible. And that will enable us as a company to cross the 50% mark, which is our milestone for 2020. Beyond 2020, we have never said that we stop at 40% for EUV. We'll continue to make the tool better. We'll have more throughput. There will be newer versions of the tool. And then I think we also said that the inherent gross margin of high-NA by its value proposition is potentially higher than what the pre-high-NA EUV does. So we're pretty comfortable that we can continue to increase the gross margin of the company over the next couple of years. \nNow as it relates to the innovation box, many governments in the world do have tax systems that support innovation, because, from an economic standpoint, that is what drives growth in those countries. It's not just the Netherlands. There's also tax credits, research tax credits in the U.S., for instance, as you know. The innovation box has been adjusted last year, also based on OECD rules. So the Netherlands has also adjusted the innovation box. And we're happy that we qualified again for the innovation box. Just as a reminder, ASML declares about -- more than 80% of our profits in the Netherlands, and it's clearly viewed as a win-win what we do here because, for every job we have at ASML, we believe there are 3 to 4 jobs in the supply chain. Universities prosper. There's lots of incremental growth for society. We got it prolonged, the conditions for those of you who are in the details have adjusted a little bit. So the advantageous tax rate is 2% higher than it used to be, but it's still advantageous. And we were able to get an agreement for 7 years. And that is supporting us with our overall model where we think in the 2020 timeframe, we'll continue to be at about a 14% tax rate for the company. So we're quite pleased with that situation.\nExecutives: Thank you, Wolfgang. Then we move up 1.\nAttendees: Thank you, chair. My name is André Jorna on behalf of the association of stockholders, in the Netherlands chair. It seems as if the trees grow up as far as heaven. They reach the sky and the sky is the limit. And you wonder about disruptive developments. And Mr. van den Brink may have seemed to have pointed it out already after the 1 nanometer. But if you live here locally, you hear from the TU in Eindhoven, the technical university, you hear about the photonic chip that they are developing, and the photonic chips is through light. And it is the processing of the major data, the big data. And Internet with the major data centers, you already mentioned the cloud. We need a lot. And with those photons that respond differently than electrons, especially with respect to light, they would be faster, less energy. They could even be sensors. So the machines that you have, can these machines really supply the industry for when the photonic chips are going to be made? So if that day comes, will the machines, the EUV and the high EUV, will they be able to handle this? That is my first topic. And then two, you are way ahead of the competition, way, way ahead. And with the current knowledge that you have and the range of machines, you are 100% monopolist, the high-end pricing power. How can you use that in EUV? You said you get a discount or markdown at Carl Zeiss. Do you also give discounts to those major partners of yours, Samsung, TSMC, Intel? Do they get a discount on the EUV machines or do you take things easy and by 2020 you think, we'll get the profit then? So the pricing power of the EUV machines, things go very fast. You do not want to have any wasted assets, and you, of course, want to get a return on your development investments. And then I have another question. The role of diminishing returns is -- we see that the machines become more complex. They cost a lot of money. They become more and more expensive. And there could be less demand. It's not for a mass-market, of course, that consideration. Is that something that you talk about or are you just going to wait and see what will happen? That is maybe something that you can't tell. Mr. Nickl, the CFO, likes risks, but controlled risks, I understand. So I'm quite curious to know as to your risks. The production capacity, you do not say, no, we haven't got it. But you say I've got a delay. It's later, but later could be counterproductive. You invested in Carl Zeiss, you bought some companies. Is it possible the production goes up to 40? Can it be higher than that? Or is that not something that the market requires? And then my final question for now, in the past 2 to 3 weeks, we've had a bit of a fright regarding what we hear about the chips industry. You say those analysts, all nonsense because the chip [ cycly ] -- [ cyclists ] haven't got those anymore, forget that. And some companies have to give a profit warning. I saw Mr. [ Lobizo ] -- oh, it was TSMC with the profit warning and [ Lobizo ] said, \"Don't worry, things are fine.\" But still, you hear these things and then you hear that the chip industry is past its zenith. Can I sleep quietly tonight?\nExecutives: Well, you should. You should sleep without any worries. Okay, we see that there's disruption throughout the room. Now following up on what I said about post optics, I think it will remain optical even after 1 nanometer. As for photonic chips, I think that our customer is thinking about different types of technologies not only photonic chips. We're also talking about quantum computing, different computer architectures. So we see that customers are looking for different architectures to boost their system performance. We believe that whatever the technology becomes, it will always, for cost reasons, it will always include miniaturizing the connections. Secondary is how those connections are made. What matters that in all cases, you need to apply those connections photographically. That's our stock and trade. We want to do things as small as possible not only in dimensions. We also want to maximize accuracy, and we want to do so as quickly as possible. We believe this is generic for any technology, and the innovation that you mention as well as other innovations will ultimately benefit total volume and total lithography demand. So we don't believe that -- we don't believe it's possible to make these advanced chips in large volumes without involving lithography. And of course, our counterparts will need the right material. But we'll keep at it. Now I have 1 comment about the next questions related to this and after that, we'll discuss the finances. You asked about the value of boosting performance. You mentioned 270 million High-NA and that's quite curious winning those High-NA orders. And charging that price -- it's not just because of our pricing power that we can -- we can also rationalize that the performance improvement of the machine, the productivity has increased the value such that the price is rationalized. And the technology is so complex that we need bigger coverage to ensure the margin. And the question is also is the machine worth the technology? And we have to work all that out before we develop the machines. And if we are developing such a large machine, we need to know that the machine is worth it so that we won't run into problems once the machine is there. And that's the value of the orders from big customers. And I'll hand you over to my fellow board members now.\nExecutives: Excellent, Martin. That's a wonderful run up to answering questions 2 and 3, the questions about pricing power and the law of diminishing returns. Martin explained it very clearly. The way -- this is how we've always done the pricing. When I joined ASML, the most expensive machine cost EUR 5 million. We just sold a machine for EUR 270 million and the customer is still buying it. And this is because of Moore's law, because Moore's law is an empirical law of economics. You have the cost per function every few years. So the cost per function per transistor 20 years ago when I arrived, the machine at EUR 5 million, those costs were considerably higher than what the customer calculates as cost per transistor for the EUR 270 million machine that will be operational in 2025. That's an exponential reduction in costs, and that's exactly the cost of the machine. If you use a logarithmic scale to calculate the cost reduction, if we can calculate what lithography adds to those costs then you would say of the cost reduction half will borne by ASML and half by the customer. That's always been our principle. And basically, we've been able to increase the price from EUR 5 million to EUR 270 million, and we still sell. It's true that fewer machines are sold, but that's simply because the transistor density because of the continuous miniaturization, density is increasing exponentially as is the productivity of the machine, so you don't need as many machines. But each machine becomes far more expensive, so that's the ASML top line. As for discounts, we sell the current EUV machine at 100% capacity. It's not yielding that yet, so you can say customers are getting a discount. But the way we put that pricing together relates to sharing the cost benefit. And we've always priced that way and we'll continue doing that in the future. As for the question about production capacity. Now it's 40 to 45 systems, which will continue in the different chains. We'll reduce throughput time in the factory as much as possible, because if we can use the same square meters, you can build more machines if you accelerate throughput times. So this is the most economic approach. If we needed higher numbers, let's say, we need 60, then we'll need to increase production capacity. I'm talking in terms of square meters. That's not relevant yet, but it depends on how successful we are and how many more EUV machines we need to build. We need that run-up time of 2, 2.5 years to increase capacity levels. And once we get there, we'll have the prospect book higher sales. Now the last question, this an update on the check industry. Despite what my predecessors said, I'm not going to say that there are no cycles in the semiconductor industry. That's logical. I'll give you one example of the different segments. The DRAM segment for the memory chips, there are 3 suppliers for that. A better example. Look at the mem chips. Those are the storage chips, they're [indiscernible] [Audio Gap] that's 5 suppliers for those Intel, Toshiba, Samsung, Hynix and Micron. If each of them decides to build a new factory at the same time, those are huge factories that cost between $5 billion and $8 billion each. And let's say that they are all competed at the same point, then you get a step of a huge increase in capacity. Now the bit demand increases by 40% to 50% a year, so you'll grow quickly there. But temporarily, in the short term, it may lead to surplus capacity and the market will react to that. But as for the medium and long-term and the TSMC story, it's not just that the smartphones are less, but the high-powered computer chips that go to the server parts or the data centers and -- they continue powering the cloud. That demand is ongoing. And as for TSMC, we are investing more in our 7- and 5-nanometer machines. Why are they doing that? Because if you look at the Apples and the Oracles in this world, that has a huge window. There are a vast number of applications for that chip. So in the medium term, we can invest more because we envisage growth. So that's justified. Whether you have a short-term view or medium to long-term view, the short-term view will focus on temporary surplus capacity in a certain segment, or in the medium term, they shouldn't -- you don't worry about that.\nAttendees: [Audio Gap] Executive and Non-Executive Representatives and of course, also all other ASML employees. My name is Denise Reike, and I represent De Vereniging van Beleggers voor Duurzame Ontwikkeling, or in English: Dutch Association of Investors for Sustainable Development. We consist of 60 institutional and over 600 private investors who support our aim to make the Dutch capital market more sustainable. And for many years now, we have been visiting ASML's AGMs as an opportunity to point to diverse stakeholder groups, your sustainability achievements made over the past year, but also of course as a possibility to further drive corporate sustainability implementation within ASML in our role as share and stakeholder. So I have 2 questions. But before that, may we -- let me make a small remark that we were a bit surprised about the relatively short item of sustainability on the agenda. Maybe, we're going to hear more about implementation of the Code but we were hoping to also see other topics addressed this year. The question that I have regards 2 topics. One is energy consumption and the other one is the payment of a living wage in the supply chain. ASML has a 10% energy savings target for 2020, taking 2015 as a reference year. And we've seen that in 2017, savings that -- and '16, a saving of 35.1 and 48.8 terajoule have been achieved. But on the other hand, on Page 174 of the annual report of this year, we find that energy consumption regarding your own operations has increased and also, significantly, compared to 2015 levels. So since 2020 is not so far away, we are wondering how sure is ASML to actually meet this target of absolute reduction compared to 2015 levels also, given the growth that we're seeing currently. In the report that we can read that you are being on track, which is not the same confident formulation that we have also heard regarding some other items today. So we were wondering how will you assure to meet this target. And also, have you already looked into energy targets beyond 2020? And regarding the living wage, I would first like to compliment you because you've made an explicit reference in the annual report that you support this concept. And we were glad to see that. We understand that within ASML directly, and luckily, living wages are not an issue and probably also not in the first supply chain tier with suppliers such as Carl Zeiss. However, we think that looking at the wider supply chain, this might well be an underaddressed issue. And as ASML has repeatedly recognized its responsibility when it comes to deeper supply chains, for example, with the conflict-free mineral initiative engagement, we are wondering how informed is ASML regarding payment of a living wage deeper in the supply chain? For instance, when it comes to this initiative or also beyond. And do you see a role for yourself in further driving this point on the agenda; for instance, in the former EICC or through owned initiatives such as an inclusion of this as a requirement in your supplier Code of Conduct?\nExecutives: Okay, there are many, many questions of 2 main questions, so there're a lot of sub-questions. I think first on the 2015, or let's say, the 2020 target with reference to 2015, you're absolutely correct. The 10% is our target. But I have to say that you are correct that in absolute terms our energy usage will go up for the simple reason that the EUV machines will actually need more energy, and then -- because the number of EUVs will actually grow, and we need to test them and they actually take a lot of energy. That is inherent and at -- in the design of it because we use high power CO2 lasers to regenerate EUV light which, where the conversion efficiency is -- let's say, is undeniably low, and there are physical limitations of how much you can drive that conversion efficiency up. Now you have to say that the EUV machines are very important for the total ecosystem because by shrinking the transistors on the chip, the energy usage of the chip will go down significantly. And as you know, I'm pretty sure as you know, that when you look at the advanced data centers, they are enormous users of energy. So more advanced chips will actually drive the energy consumption down but you need, unfortunately, an EUV system for it that initially needs a high energy input. But I think the equation, from a broader perspective, gives a very positive business case, you could say, on the use of EUV systems and further shrink. Now that doesn't mean that we're not working at lowering the energy usage of those systems, which will be part of the further designs of those tools. So there will be a further reduction of the energy usage or the -- let's say, the conversion efficiency driving that up. Now having said that, well, it is inevitable that we will, with the growth of the EUV business, start using, in absolute terms, more energy. We are focusing on reaching our target of 100% renewable energy by 2020. And currently, we're at 72%. Now how do we do that? We are sourcing this through the guarantee of origin projects, where we make sure that we buy renewable energy, those labels are actually there. Yes? So why we cannot avoid, as a higher usage, the focus on renewable energies and also the funding of what we call the guarantee of origin projects which we do, yes, will enable us to at least have a significant contribution to this issue. And the target is beyond 2020. Yes, we are formulating currently targets beyond 2020. It has to do with the fact that we are really looking at the focus areas of our sustainable strategy as defined by the United Nations framework whereby, basically, as we are looking at what the most relevant items are of that framework as to -- as it relates to the ASML strategy. And that will determine, and it's probably going back from 9 to 5 focused areas where we are currently defining the 2025 strategic targets. And when we think about this and the SDGs of the United Nations, the Sustainable Development Goals that have been formulated, I think we're basically focusing or we'll very likely focus on the 5 most important ones. And I think it's the quality of education whereby people development and training is extremely important. We furthermore have what we call the decent work and economic growth in our goal, which is the co-development with the suppliers. It actually relates to your second question.  We have to make sure that all our suppliers, and we are making sure that all our suppliers are part of the Responsible Business Alliance and they have signed that Code. Industry and innovation as a third SDG whereby industry innovation and the way that we innovate is very much driven by our open innovation concept, which is very typical to ASML whereby, for instance, our R&D charge, which this year is significantly over the -- close to EUR 1.3 billion of last year is shared in the supply chain, about 45% of our R&D is not with ASML. It's with our partners and our suppliers. SDG 12 was about the responsible consumption and production that focused very much on the circular economy. Now we have or close to 100%, over 99% of our parts are -- sorry? So 99% of our parts are actually recirculated. Our tools in the field, we have special upgrade programs to make sure that they are not decommissioned and that they're actually reused and they're upgraded to the next level of performance. And on the climate action, we talked about it. This is about the energy efficiency of our products, about the conversion efficiency focus we have in EUV. And I think, making sure that the electricity that we use is 100% renewable. And those out of the 5 -- I think the 5 core areas of focus that we will put into our sustainable strategy going forward. And that will lead to 2025 targets that we will share with you in our next integrated report. We need to define those targets as a board, and we need to agree with them with our senior management group, but that will be the result of the work that we will do this year. On your question of the living wages, I will go back to what I said earlier. It's one of the target areas of the SDG focus that we will have going forward. It is very much part of our focus of -- on our supply chain and where we do our supplier audits. The supplier audits involve not only quality logistic technology and cost but also a fifth element we just called sustainability, and we require that our suppliers are part and have underwritten the code of the Responsible Business Alliance, which, of course, needs to support the whole concept of a living wage. Now you ask a question about how deep does our insight go into the supply chain. It doesn't stop at Tier 1. It very often goes down to tiers 2 and 3 and even 4.  It depends a little bit on what we are buying. But what we are buying generally is technology that is developed and manufactured in countries that are subscribing to the sustainable development goals and actually companies that are public companies and have underwritten those goals. So for our suppliers, it is a requirement to underwrite those -- the Responsible Business Alliance code papers, but it is not a major issue for them because it is very often part of their sustainable strategy already. So we happen to have a supply chain that doesn't operate in areas where a living wage is a real issue. That is an advantage of this company, but also we make sure that our suppliers live up to the Code.\nExecutives: Thank you, Peter. The next question?\nAttendees: I'm [ Terry Yeltson ]. I'd also like to compliment you on those figures. It's great that you manage to sustain those year-after-year. I was wondering in recent months. Of course, ASML learns from technological breakthroughs in physics, chemistry and mathematics. And can you tell me about other factors? Do your errors in accelerations relate to embedded software? Because I imagine there are millions of codes in those machines. So in other words, is it that the problem relates to physics or the chemistry or is it -- does the problem also relate to computer science? I think that Mr. van den Brink is the best person to answer that, but I do note that the EUV machine has 51 million lines of code, so that's quite a challenge.\nExecutives: Martin?\nExecutives: I would like to say that building machines comprises many different disciplines, not just physics. I would say that straightforward machine building involves many different elements and even more software than the 50 million lines of codes. But what we've been working on in recent years is that expanding to greater automation and Mr. Wennink showed you our holistic triad in lithography with machines at the top and computational lithography at the bottom and other computational features. So in California and in China, there are software developments that make it possible to simulate chip production and that's not a panacea, it involves extremely sophisticated software and that simulation needs to be calculated. We use self-learning algorithms for that, that can optimize the entire process. So we see a growing role for software but it's not -- it's the integration between the software and the hardware. They need to be aligned. You can almost say that's the secret of our technology. We have another question at the left there.\nAttendees: Mr. Chairman, I'm Mr. [indiscernible] from Amsterdam. I have a question based on the annual report. It is very readable, but I still have a few questions, that the message of the CEO, because you're right that there is increasing scope of application for semiconductors. That's true. And you mentioned that you -- that wonderful products need -- require good employees and ASML depends on them. That's also true. But then, in the [ updated ] Dutch Financial Daily on 21 April, 2018 there was a remuneration specialist, [indiscernible], who explained that to some extent, money is secondary. It's the nonfinancial aspects that carry the most weight in considering job changes. Then, I look on your website, and I see a vast number of vacancies. I'm not sure why you didn't find candidates for them. Is it because of those nonfinancial aspects? And at ASML, you're aiming to achieve more -- a lot smaller, more powerful and more energy-efficient but -- and more cost-efficient, too. But I'm wondering is why are there so many unfilled vacancies in your company? Is it because of the people in your organization? I'd like to face-off with you about that. Perhaps, do you need to offer some nonfinancial incentives? I'd like you to tell me more about that. And of course, this morning, I read the Dutch Financial Daily and that was quite a shock because Mr. Nickl is leaving. Couldn't you retain him for the nonfinancials? I thought that was a pity. But then I read on, and you also have the most patents because of your technology, and there are at least 2 people in your organization who are being considered for a wonderful award. So that's good news. But I think it sad that Mr. Nickl is leaving.\nExecutives: Okay, duly noted. We agree but we stand an excellent success in Mr. Dassen.  We'll tell you more about him later on.\nAttendees: I'm not there yet, but I'd certainly like you to tell me who is in charge of nonfinancial aspects.\nExecutives: Okay, first Mr. Wennink will talk about the growth of ASML, the contingent of employees and our pace in filling vacancies.\nExecutives: Unfilled vacancies. This is mainly to do with the fact of timing, because at the moment, we have an annual run rate as we call it. So the vacancies in the past 12 months, actually, I should say the job applicants, more than 100,000, but we only need a couple of thousand. So we have to be very selective. Yes, we need people but we need to right people and that financial part only a very small part, you're quite right. And of course, we pay good wages. No doubt about that. We pay well. But people in Silicon Valley, they come to ASML because they've had it to make emoticons for WhatsApp. So they'd rather make algorithms, complex machines such as we make. And maybe they've entered here through, or maybe you've entered here through the Plaza and that is a great place for all those hundreds of nationalities or more than 100 nationalities to meet those people. So it's not just how much you earn but also what you get, what you experience. And we have a very low churn rate. People stay because it's not just the financial reward. It is what they do, with whom they work, what the company is like. And yes, we still have a lot of vacancies because it takes about 3 to 4 months before you find the right people. So we always have some vacancies. There will always be some vacancies. We'll never have every spot filled, but our HR department is convinced that with those major influx of people that apply for jobs because apparently, we have a very good reputation as an employer, so it's not going to be any trouble to fill the vacancies that we wish to fill. We will be able to do that.\nExecutives: Thank you, Peter. So the nonfinancial benefits of ASML are quite good, the fringe benefits. And Mr. [indiscernible] speaks but without use of the mic so he's not quite audible to the interpreters. Okay, that is not a problem. The average age is very stable. We have a lot of new hires from universities so they make sure that the average age is a bit lower than the average age that you see here behind this desk. We're a bit older than the average employee is.\nAttendees: The next question, I read in the past couple of weeks that China has an emphasis for the next 10 to 20 years of the production of chips. My question to you, which is an inevitable question I feel, how do you view the development? And what is your position in this? And my second question is I hear that you developed software in China, and the -- what about the intellectual property rights of ASML and the parties in China that you work with?\nExecutives: By the way, that last bit is not right. That's not so. It is not a condition, so that doesn't bother us. \nSo disregard this because that's not the situation. So China, how do you view China?  \nQuite evident, I would say. I think that as indicated in the 5-year plan, they are going from being the sweatshop of the world to top-end value-adding, and it's been made very clear that the semiconductor industry and the chip industry is essential in this. They will invest some [ EUR ] 200 billion in the local Chinese industry, and we participate significantly. In our most recent quarterly report and our conference call with the analysts, out of the 15 plants, 7 are in China. We participate in all, so we have a very significant part in this. And that is necessary to develop the chip industry, you need advanced lithography. And we have good agreements on this with our Chinese clients. So as far as I'm concerned, it is a good thing but how fast will they develop? Because if you want to be a player in the advanced chip industry, you have to have the advanced process technology, advanced technology to have the chips do what they need to do, which is not necessarily the case in China. Yes in Taiwan, Korea, United States, among other countries where, of course, they look and see what happens in China for the protection of the intellectual property. That is an issue, of course, between the United States and China and, of course, these are things that we monitor very closely and -- I can't say anything about this, no restriction whatsoever at the moment. But what the future brings, we'll see in the future. China, no doubt, is ready, especially in the next decade to be a player in the advanced technology, and we are also ready to be a major player. Who else would like to say something? Mr. [indiscernible] is up.\nAttendees: I've got to ask 2 further questions. The business plan. In the bad times, you survived because of the flexible model of the business plan. But more and more do you invest in the trades, [ Sima ], Carl Zeiss, [ HMI], so your business plan is not as flexible as it used to be. Also, because the employees that you have, you want to retain them and that is by getting fewer flex employees and more permanent employees. So what about the future? Everything's going up, it's on the up, but what if we have another downturn? Will you be flexible enough? Second question is that I had to really try and find out what the portfolio is like, the order portfolio and what it comprises. I understand you're not going to share this with us anymore? Why not?\nExecutives: Right. Your first question. The flexible model, you're quite right in '08 and '09, the financial crisis. At that time, we used that flexibility. But still 80% is in the supply chain, and we still have a lot of flexible staff members or flex employees. The company is growing fast. So some flexible employees who've been working here for quite some time and who are performing well, you'd like them to be in a permanent position, and that's why you see the conversions. This is a situation that will remain. And don't forget in 2009, our market share was between 50% and 60%. Now it is higher so the technology transection always continues through the cycles. It's always the most advanced technology. And if we look at all over sales, it is mainly through that advanced technology. I can't tell you here but it is a lot. So that is a good foundation. So we still have that flexibility. It's a little bit less, fair enough. But on the other hand, our market share increased quite considerably. And then the order portfolio. Our colleagues in the industry applied research and others don't share the portfolio, the order portfolio. And the reason why is that we have a limited number of customers, and the way in which we plan our business, it is not traditionally based on the orders because, for advanced lithography, the clients come to us. And the client needs us to have the right machines ready for them at the right time. So it is a different production planning and a sales planning. It's a very -- we have a very integrated relationship with our customers. The plans of our customers for the next 18 months are discussed between us and them on a weekly, sometimes on a daily basis. And this means that we can check what -- how our machines connect with theirs. We look at the pedestals which are where -- on which the machines have to be assembled, and these things take months. So we know exactly what the client is doing, what the customer is doing. And if this is not clear and transparent, we have to second-guess and we will be wrong. So we have to have a very close cooperation so the order is mainly the end -- actually, the end of the process. So the procurement department of Samsung gives us a lot of orders and sometimes it's TSMC. The financial market concludes [ strengths ] from this that are not justified because they do not understand the background of this system. It is the end of an administrative process, and it takes us weeks to explain this to outsiders. And I'll be honest, we don't talk about the long-term vision and the order portfolios with the shareholders. The institutions want to know this. They look at the shorter term and they want to understand -- analysts also want to understand. The real -- the true story is that the way in which we sell is not like the traditional driving of the order intake. And our colleagues in the industry said some time ago, okay, too much volatility, not going to do this anymore.\nExecutives: Thank you, Peter. And the Chairman says, I see that it looks like all your questions have been answered, which means that I'll go to the Secretary.\nExecutives: Thank you, Chair. And on the registration date of this meeting, the outstanding number of shares of EUR 0.09 was 431,467,000 or something. And the company has a number of treasury shares, and the number of outstanding was, therefore -- outstanding amounts, was [ 426,558,060 ] for the shares. As one, it's about ordinary share entitles to 9 votes that will be 38,839,022,567 votes that may be cast. And at the beginning of this meeting, we had 2,322. And the total number of shares that was either represented or present is 3,325,123,695 -- 2 billion -- in excess of 2 billion votes may be cast during this meeting, and that means that 76% of the issued share capital is represented here at this meeting including Intel, which is one of the partners in the investment program, which represents 3.2%. And the agenda of this meeting does not have any items based on which the Intel can vote based on that partnership program. As an excess of 50% of the share capital is at this meeting, all voting items on the agenda may be adopted with the simple majority of the votes cast. Agenda item 3 is a discussion of the implementation of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code 2016. As Mr. Wennink already indicated in one of his slides and after a thorough checking and from adaptation, we came to the conclusion that we are fully compliant with the Dutch Corporate Governance Code. And as he discussed it, I see that there are no questions on this topic which means that we can now go to the number -- next item of the agenda which is the implementation of the Remuneration Policy 2017. We must discuss this separately before we adopt the financial statements. And this is on the current remuneration policy on 2017. And it is an item to be discussed. We're not going to vote on this, as you also saw in the agenda and into the explanatory notes. Mr. Schwalb, you will give us an explanation on this I understand. Thank you.\nExecutives: Is the mic on? Can you hear me?\nExecutives: Yes. Yes.\nExecutives: Because it shows a red light so I was confused. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This report is on the policy implementation which we all approved, you approved last year and it applied already as for the full year. So that happens for the base salary and the STI. The long-term incentive, because the targets were set in 2015, I come back to that, of course, still follow the old policy because it needs 3 years to get into the new policy. Now the base salaries last year were not increased for the board of management. I think we discussed it already last year. For the short-term incentive, the payout reached a total of 91% of maximum, which is about 89% of the base salary. We have 5 targets, each rated 20%. The qualitative performance criteria, which are the technology leadership index and market position. One was achieved between target and maximum performance level, and the other one at maximum. This information is new. It is the first time that we inform you in that detail about the achievements. We never did that in the past, so this is for the first time on your [ visage ]. On the financial performance criteria, we informed you last year that we had 3. The EBIT margin, the EUV shipments, and free cash flow. And you see here on the slide that the first and the last were 150% payout of target, which is max, and the EUV shipments were at target. So below max, obviously. You also find, as promised last year in the annual report, I think it's Page 149, the financial targets set for this year, not the numbers of course because those we will not publish, but which targets we chose and they are basically the same as for 2017 i.e., EBIT margin, EUV shipments and free cash flow.\nNext slide. On the long-term incentive. As I said, but this still follows the old policy according to targets set in 2015. So you don't find, for example, total shareholder return there, which is part of the new policy. But the first targets were set last year. So the first time we will discuss results will be in 2 years from now. \nWe had 3 targets on the old policy. That was a qualitative target, which is a combination of sustainability and technology leadership index over 3 years. That was evaluated at 94% of max. On the return on average of invested capital, the old system was foreseeing a comparison with a peer group of basically all U.S. companies, and it was the question of where do we rank in that list. Now we discussed last year already that this is a quite complex process and there's a lot of distortion in that system. The mathematical calculation leads us to a result leading to a payout of 63% of max. The combination of this with a qualitative target leads to a total of 69%. Now the supervisory board felt that this result does not really reflect properly the enormous success and development of the company in the last 3 years. And therefore, for the first time, we used our discretionary power, which is part of the remuneration policy, and increased the vesting level to 75% from the 69% which was the mathematical results. So we increased it by 6% points. Why is it so complicated? Yes, it's -- for example, one thing which distorted the results a lot, quite significantly even for some companies, was the U.S. tax reform introduced end of 2017 and finding its way into the financial results of, of course, all the U.S. companies but also to a smaller extent into ASML's financial results. That is something you cannot plan and not foresee. Then of course, another element was one company in the list made tremendous and partly, I must say also, how they accounted for it, quite strange restructuring steps. And yes, last but not least, we invested a lot of -- in our acquisitions with HMI and also ZEISS last year. So all of that distorts the results quite significantly. That's why we felt this discretionary adjustment to 75% of max is justified. Now I think in hindsight, I'm even more glad that in the new policy, as of 2017, '18, '19 target period. So in 2 years to be judged the results that we changed from this return on average invested capital versus peers to an absolute target based on our long-term financial plans. That I hope will be much clearer and easier to evaluate. Having said that, this is basically the report. Next year, of course, we will still have to live with the old system and its complications. So we'll see what another year will bring but it will not be easy again. I can already know, not promise but I expect it. Let's see. Any questions?\nExecutives: Thank you very much for the detailed explanation. Are there any questions from the audience with respect to the way the Remuneration Committee has implemented the existing policy? If not, thank you very much. All these end up with [ results ] have been crystal clear. \nI move to point 4b. And 4b is the discussion of the board's report and also the proposal to adopt the financial statements of the company for 2017. We have an integrated report in both the financial and nonfinancial details. And again, we have 2 integrated -- we have 2 financial statements. One, based on the IFRS -- sorry, on U.S. GAAP and 1 based on the IFRS, which we use in Europe. The integrated report based on IFRS and Dutch Law is submitted to you. And you were able to take cognizance of this, to inspect it because it was available at the offices of the company and was published on our website. Mr. van Delden of KPMG is present here today, and he will give you some insight into KPMG's audit activities for us in 2017. And any questions regarding the audit may be answered by Mr. van Delden. I give the floor to your Mr. van Delden.\nAttendees: Thank you. As Mr. Kleisterlee said, indeed, 2 reports for which we issued the certificate, the U.S. GAAP and the IFRS. And it gives you some insight into the effectiveness of the -- all the details. And as was mentioned the 2 different ones. And we have done the work, has resulted in a statements that says that everything was done okay. We have some 7 pages of explanations. And I'd like you to refer to that part. I would like to highlight 3 things. Of course, ASML is a global company with centralization here in Veldhoven, of much of the work, which means that the Dutch team has done the group audit mostly from the Netherlands. So the global audit was done mainly here, apart from Carl Zeiss. So because of the centralized position, we can have wide coverage. Some 90% of the assets are part of direct auditing and some 90% of the revenues we can have a review of. Our certificate also gives an insight in the key audit matters, the KAM. They get special attention. We had 2, in the past year, key audit matters and that is the revenue recognition. There are major contracts that are subdivided into smaller contracts. You have to link them right, amounts to the right contracts. And of course, you have to do the recognition in times, not too early, not too late but at the right time. We looked at many contracts, and we're happy with what we found. Secondly, we looked at ZEISS' major investment in the past year, a major amount, and that was one of the reasons why we looked at it in detail and it is also quite a complex contract because it is not just the investment but also an R&D corporation, so we've spent a lot of time on these 2 items, and that's all I want to say so far. Does anyone have a question on this part, this item of the agenda? And Mr. [indiscernible] has a question and the mic is handed to him by Mr. van Delden so that's easy.\nAttendees: There were legal issues and you didn't say a lot about specialists and I'd like to know a little bit more about, especially, legal specialists. And in addition to this, there is another item, another legal item which I would like you to tell me more about. Please elucidate me on this, the qualitative, quantitative side?\nExecutives: Tell me what you expect.  Of course, if we need specialists for the audit, we employ those. And you talk about the legal issues. Of course, we talk to management. We talk to in-house legal counsel and for any major matters we request lawyers' letters, which means that these are letters from lawyers that give an insight or that give their views. And in addition to those letters, we also spoke to external council for major issues. And we used that input and the legal matters, the major ones, I feel, were explained properly in the financial report. Does that answer your question, sir?\nAttendees: [indiscernible]\nAttendees: The legal positions. 2 things you should know. First of all, you have to look at probability. Will money flow out from the company? And secondly, you have to have reliable estimations. In major cases, that is important, so we agree with the position of the management as we put forward. Yes, we agree with management. Yes, true. Yes, that is right.\nExecutives: Mr. [ Stephens ] is not audible but a mic is on its way.\nAttendees: Mr. Wennink just gave an explanation on that. I told you what we did and, of course, the outcome is never certain, but as it is included in the report as it has been explained, I think that that is sufficient.\nExecutives: I reiterate. It is more likely than not that there is going to be an obligation. If it is not probable, that's okay, end of story. But you have to be able -- if it is the case, you have to be able to quantify it and sometimes it cannot be quantified. It could be 0. It could be a lot that is at risk. Who knows? Because you can't tell what the judge, what the court is going to do. So we looked into the legal issues and we concluded that we do not need additional quantitative provisions. External legal counsel agrees, the auditor agrees, Mr. van Delden has just said that looking at all the facts, he agrees and that's it.\nAttendees: Yes, but there's case law.\nExecutives: Well, yes, but that's other cases. So that is not our case. Case law is in the past. Case law is for the court to look into, but it's no help for us to quantify. Case law is in the past. Everything that we could do was made or could make available was made available to you in the annual report.\nExecutives: Yes, but I want to turn it into a [indiscernible].\nExecutives: But we can't. We can't. Well, Mr. Stephens, maybe you can give us an indication what you think it should be, but we have got no indication whatsoever. Questions in the back.\nAttendees: My name is Mr. [indiscernible].  Which countries did you actually visit? Because you said that you could assess the global situation from Veldhoven or maybe by e-mail. But most colleagues of yours say in other AGMs what countries they actually visited. You went to ZEISS in Germany, I understand. What other countries were visited?\nExecutives: Well, we don't do everything by e-mail but, of course, we can look into all the global systems. And in the past year, I went to Korea, I want to Taiwan, 2 of the main countries for ASML, very important countries for ASML. I spoke with local management, with local auditors. We also have obligations under the Articles of Association which we have to check. And it usually takes a little bit longer before we get those.  We do have a network of local auditors, but we could do most of the work ourselves. So we go to a couple of countries this year. We plan to go to China and to the United States of America.\nAttendees: André Jorna with VEB. Yes, there's been much debate about your -- well, in social interaction because you are our eyes and ears in companies. To what extent can you assure us that ASML's income statement is as it should be? Because you audited it and checked whether any money items are being shifted around? For example, earnings being transferred to a different year?  How did you do that and how did you establish that in all properties present?\nAttendees: Well, we scrutinize the revenues, so revenue recognition being taken at the correct point in time is something we monitor carefully. And as for the income state whether the assets are present and whether the company still has sufficient earnings capacity. Of course, that's the case. As for intangibles such as goodwill and activating development costs, we look at those very carefully, too. So we think that the income sheet is as it should be. And as you see in our auditor’s opinion, we believe it's a true and fair view.\nAttendees: We're happy to hear that the income statement is as it should be. That comforts us and put that in writing, too. But there's a lot in writing nowadays that doesn't always turn out to be true, especially if you zoom in. As for your management letter, was it longer or shorter than it was last time?\nAttendees: I would say it was about the same length. I think some items that we identified last year have been resolved, and we've discovered a few new ones. What matters most is that management follows up on this and takes it on board and they did.\nAttendees: As for the accuracy of financial reportings, the internal audits, including cybersecurity, do you have a good opinion about those as well?\nAttendees: Well, that was why we mentioned the U.S. statements where we shared opinions concerning the financial reporting. With cybersecurity, our main role is to determine that management considers what we reported and that they also follow up with the Supervisory Board. So we see whether they follow up in sufficient measure. Thank you.\nExecutives: If there are no additional questions, then I'll hand you back to our Secretary.\nExecutives: I'll explain the voting procedure. Those of you are entitled to cast a vote at this meeting have received voting handsets and a chip card containing the data that matter for this meeting. Please insert your smart card with the gold-colored chip facing you into your keypad. Once you've inserted the smart card properly, you'll see a welcome message on the display, then you can keep that card inside your keypad during the meeting. If the smart card is not inserted properly, you'll see a warning message on the display. At the moment the vote is open, you will see the option to vote on the display. Press 1 if you are voting in favor of the proposal, press 2 if you are voting against the proposal and press -- use 3 if you would like to abstain from the vote. The display will confirm your selection. You may change your selection, but once the vote is closed your final selection counts. If you have difficulty voting, please raise your hand and somebody will come to assist you. We'll try a dry run of voting based on a statement, and this statement is, \"I have visited the ASML Experience Center before.\" Will the voting operator please activate the system.  Mr. Stephens has a problem.\nAttendees: Unfortunately, the speaker is inaudible. Interpreter apologizes.\nExecutives: [Foreign Language] The vote has been opened for a while. Please cast your vote.\n[Voting]\nExecutives: [Foreign Language] Most of you have already voted in this trial run. So in a few moments, I'd like to close the vote. The vote is closed, and we'll await the outcome. And I see the outcome is available and a great many of you have been there by now. Well, it's certainly a nice place.\nExecutives: [Foreign Language] I'd like to continue with the vote on agenda item 4. Please take your keypad and voting handset, and we've explained the procedure. And as soon as we open the vote, please cast your votes. Please open the vote on agenda item 4b. Please cast your vote.\n[Voting]\nExecutives: [Foreign Language] I see that most of you have cast your vote. So I will close the vote. [Foreign Language] It's closed. [Foreign Language]  The result is available, and I see that the proposal has been adopted. [Foreign Language]. Okay, for some reason, the percentages didn't add up, but you did see the result of the votes cast. We're delighted to see 100%, but that's not really right now. Clarification of the company's reserves and dividend policy. This is a discussion item, not a voting item, and the company aims to pay out a dividend that will be stable and to continue to grow. And for additional explanation on the dividend policy of the company, please see pages 88 and beyond of the integrated report for 2017. Are there any questions about this topic?\nMr. Jorna?\nAttendees: Mr. Chairman, the share buyback from EUR 1.5 billion to EUR 2 billion, of course, we don't oppose that. The payout ratio stands at approximately 28%, which is a bit low if you compare that with others. And the question is that substantial increase is because of the increase in cash, you have a lot, so you can divert some to shareholders. That's fine. You've purchased at EUR 109 in the past, so that's a considerable profit, as well. Do you expect that given the share price today and 2 weeks ago, do you expect to create value for the shareholders by repurchasing the shares? Or do you think that the share price is very high now and as for your repurchasing and timing the repurchasing, do you say we don't care with the share price is, we'll simply repurchase a chunk every quarter, or do you take direction in that?\nExecutives: I'll hand you over to our CFO, Wolfgang, for that question.\nExecutives: Thanks for your question. We have -- we apply our capital returns policy pretty consistently for 8 to 10 years now. We do foresee a split between dividends and share buybacks. The reason for that is it gives us flexibility. As you know, dividends, although we increase them all the time, is something that we do not want to take away. Even in the financial crisis in 2008 and '09, we didn't take away the dividends. But we are very focused on giving money that we don't need to run the business back to shareholders. We keep sufficient cash reserves and financial flexibility also from a debt capacity, et cetera, to put investments back in the business in the form of R&D and M&A. And we're in constant contact with our shareholders on what type of returns the shareholders prefer. And as you can imagine, you ask 100 shareholders, you get different opinions. But the vast majority is agreeing with us that we keep the dividend at a manageable level, keep the flexibility by using share buybacks, and you have seen that at work in 2016, 2017. We were well advised to have a relatively lower dividend because we could cut down the share buyback program when we were buying HMI and making a major equity investment in Carl Zeiss. As it relates to the volume of the share buybacks, you could see we had a EUR 1.5 billion program for 2016/'17 that we did not exhaust. We only used EUR 900 million because of the 2 reasons I just mentioned, and we have just announced a EUR 2.5 billion program for 2018/2019. As it relates to the share price, we are not predicting the share price. We believe it's a very appropriate form of giving back money now to the shareholder and increasing the portion of the future profits to the remaining shareholders. So we have no set target price where we would start -- stop the share buyback program.\nExecutives: Thank you, Wolfgang.\nAttendees: Mr. Nickl, do you, therefore, believe that at this -- with this course of action you're creating value. Is the value of the company lower than the share price suggests so? Are you creating value or are you saying that's not an issue at all?\nExecutives: That a company creates value by either doing dividends or buying back shares, that's just 2 different forms of returning cash to the shareholders. The company creates value by creating an attractive product portfolio that creates a value for our customers and that increases our future cash flows. I think you can also look at the theory. There are endless debates about the mix of these 2 instruments, but I firmly believe that you don't create value by the choice of the forms how you give money back to shareholders.\nExecutives: And he is implicitly saying that -- and also when you've carefully listened to what we've said on the future of this industry and the position of ASML, that it is about value creation and about growth. So in that context, I think, we have given you an indirect answer to your question.\nAttendees: Yes, I heard that, and I understand it. But what I'm actually aiming at is whether you think that ASML is worth more than the current share price?\nExecutives: Well, that's not truly our call. That's up to the market and you, as investors. And we are good at building sophisticated machines and selling them to our customers. We aim to create as much value as possible to maximize the bottom line and generate a lot of cash so that, in addition to our minimum cash, we can distribute money to shareholders. I think that's a very -- that's an excellent policy. The market is generally saying bye. [ Mr. Spanier ]?\nAttendees: I'm [ Mr. Spanier ], I have a question. Unfortunately, Mr. Nickl will be leaving us. So a buyback campaign is in progress. The new CFO that remains to be appointed, I hope for her sake that she makes the grade. What instructions will she or he receive? Will that person be expected to carry out the same share buyback arrangement that Mr. Nickl devised? What will the instructions be?\nExecutives: I think it's very simple. I certainly hope so. Yes, it is. Okay, for the time being, the answer is yes. Financial policy, overall, has been devised by the CFO. Of course, as discussed and approved within the board and management, and we agree entirely, there is no change in financial policy. So as I was just saying, all cash above the minimum we need will be returned to shareholders as dividend and that is it a growing, but in any case, stable dividend, and the rest is -- consist of share buyback. And I have no reason to assume that the new CFO, whom I know very well, is likely to change that.\nAttendees: That was my question because you devised a certain vision together with Mr. Nickl and the supervisory board but now you'll have a new dude in that position. Are you -- the person -- are you going to tell the new financial dude how we do it? Or will you hand that over to Mr. Kleisterlee?\nExecutives: No, I prefer to leave that to the new CFO to develop that with us, but I know the new CFO, and I'm fully confident that it will be done with good common sense and policy, so I see no reason why we should adapt to our present dividend with the policy on returning money. All I can tell you is my estimate is that any changes on our part will be extremely minimal.\nAnd I'll wrap up this agenda item and move on to adopting a dividend of 1 year of EUR 0.40 per ordinary share. Because this topic has already been discussed in agenda item 2 and 4C, I'll refer to the previous debate and will now give you the opportunity to ask any additional questions should you feel such a need. If not, then I propose that we vote on the dividend proposal. The voting operator has to activate the system. Please cast your vote.\n[Voting]\nExecutives: I see that most of you have voted. I'd like to close the system in a few moments. The vote is closed and we will await the results.\nI see that the results are available and that a majority of the votes has been cast in favor of the proposal. So we note that this proposal has been adopted as well.\nOnto agenda item 5A. The proposal to discharge the members of the board of management from liability for carrying out their responsibilities in the financial year 2017. Would anybody like the floor on this? If not, we will open the vote on this proposal, as well. Mr. Secretary, with the operator, please activate the voting system. The vote is open.\n[Voting]\nExecutives: I see that most of you have cast your vote. We're about to close the vote. The vote is closed.\nI see the results of the vote are available. Over to the Chairman. Now I have some percentages, at least partial at some places, so we note that this proposal has been adopted.\nNext, approval of the number of shares to be allocated to the board of management -- wait a minute, 5B, the proposal to discharge the members of the supervisory board from liability. Nobody would like the floor. We'll activate the system. Open the vote with the voting -- operator, please activate the system. Please cast your vote.\n[Voting]\nExecutives: I see that most of you have already voted, so we'll be closing the vote in a few moments. The vote is closed.\nI see the results are available and a majority of the votes has been cast in favor of the proposal. Okay. So that's been adopted. Wonderful, we have the approval to -- we have the approval. Now the proposal to approve the number of shares for the board of management. The ultimate allocation of shares will be done by the supervisory board based on the applicable remuneration policy by applying the calculation method as described in such policy. Furthermore, in this agenda item, it is proposed to the general meeting to designate the board of management as the body authorized to issue the aforementioned shares subject to the approval of the supervisory board. This designation is requested for the period from this meeting until the Annual General Meeting to be held in 2019. ASML has previously agreed to inform the general meeting each year about the exact number of shares granted conditionally on 19 January 2018, 43,500 -- excuse me, 43,650 shares have been granted conditionally to the current board of management, excluding the new members for the financial year 2018. The volume weighted average share price during the last quarter of the financial year 2017 equaled EUR 149.82. In connection with his intended appointment, Mr. Dassen has been granted a conditional board in 2019 for 10,000 performance-related shares. This grant is subject to the performance conditions and the 3-year vesting period. As applicable under the remuneration policy, the maximum number of shares can be -- can be obtained are up to 20,000 performance-related shares and in 2019, the general meeting will also be informed about the number of shares granted conditionally to the board of management for the financial year 2019. Now, I'd like to open the floor to questions. Mr. Jorna?\nAttendees: Mr. Chairman, I'm Jorna from the VEB. Mr. Chairman, granting what I describe as a sign-on bonus for Mr. Dassen, we, as the -- from the VEB, object to this on principle. He has not done anything to earn this. It's probably compensation for what he would have received at Deloitte as a long-term incentive, and we don't see any reason to compensate him for the long-term incentive at Deloitte because it tends to be conditional and you don't know whether he'd achieve it. And second, you're giving a staff member a bonus to keep them over the long term within the company. If all of us agree to take over that bonus, then we'd be done and dusted, but I don't think that's the right way to deal with a long-term incentive. That's why we object on principle to a sign-on bonus.\nExecutives: We know that, and we understand that. But the situation is a bit more subtle than that, perhaps Rolf-Dieter Schwalb could explain why in this case the entire supervisory board supports the Remuneration Committees' conclusion that this is a good way forward.\nExecutives: I'll try to explain that. Mr. Dassen, in his capacity as an employee of Deloitte, received only fixed income. So no variable part. That fixed income was significantly higher than what we can offer to him. And to basically compensate him at risk because our system has a risk, as you know, STI, LTI, and it will follow the same LTI, the 10,000 shares, 20,000 maximum will follow the same LTI rules as all the other LTIs. So it can be 0, it can be 20,000, it can be anything in between. So there's a risk element to it. So forgetting the risk, the 10,000 at target achievement on the LTI performance criteria would basically, for 3 years, roughly be equivalent to the delta of the total direct compensation at ASML versus the fixed compensation he received at Deloitte. That was what he felt totally reasonable and it follows performance criteria. There's no sign-on bonus guaranteed, nothing. And it basically only smoothens it for 3 years. So he has to show, of course, with his own work and performance that after that period, he either has to live with a lower salary, that's then bad luck, or achieve a higher salary because of results.\nExecutives: Thank you, Rolf-Dieter. Thank you. That's highly appreciated. [ Mr. Spanier ]?\nAnalysts: I'm [ Mr. Spanier ], I have a question. We're talking about the number of shares. Are you going to reissue the shares that you've repurchased in the previous buyback? You're not going to run the process again. And I basically object to St. Nicholas and Christmas gifts where you simply stand and wait for them. Why don't you let the person concerned work for 1 year first and then ask shareholders after 1 year -- he's been working for 1 year. Can you please have this EUR 10,000 or 10,000 shares or whatever, rather than before giving him the Santa Claus or Christmas present to unwrap before he even comes on board.\nExecutives: Well, I could go along with part of this but then say, okay, well, he will only be able to unwrap his gift after a few years of good performance. Yes, I hear you. And I think Mr. Schwalb has tried to explain this is not a Santa Claus or a Christmas gift, and that these performance shares have a 3-year vesting period. And that means performing for 3 years after which there will or will not be a payment, except for the nominal shares. It's not 1 year, it's about 3 years, and it has to be an empty kitty, too. May I now open the vote on this proposal? Would the operator please activate the system? I see the system is active and you may now cast your vote.\n[Voting]\nExecutives: I see that the majority of you have cast your vote and in a few seconds, I'm going to close the vote. The vote is closed.\nAnd I see that the result is available and the majority has voted in favor of the proposal, so we note that this proposal has been adopted as well.\nThat takes us to agenda item 7, composition of the board of management. On 12 September 2017, we announced that Wolfgang Nickl had decided, as of today's shareholders meeting, to leave at HSML -- excuse me, ASML. First, Mr. Wolfgang, we did this with the entire supervisory board yesterday evening and the board of management, you must have done this countless times within ASML. Once again, in the presence of our shareholders, we're pleased to thank you for your exceptionally valuable contribution to the growth and development of ASML. You had -- were a magnificent CFO and the Rock of Gibraltar on the management team. Thank you. And in your new role as Bayer's CFO, we wish you all the very best. It's a small world. I'm sure we'll see each other again in the future. We wish all the very best. At this agenda item, the supervisory board informs the board of management of envisaged reappointment of Peter Wennink, Martin van den Brink, Frederic Schneider-Maunoury and -- as members of the ASML board of management. The reasons for reappointing Mr. Wennink, van den Brink and Schneider-Maunoury are explained in the agenda and do not require extensive elaboration. The reappointments of Wennink, van den Brink and Schneider-Maunoury will be for a 4-year term commencing as of today. In addition, the supervisory board informs the general meeting of the envisaged appointment of Mr. Christophe Fouquet and Mr. Roger Dassen as members of the board of management at ASML. And please see the reasons for the appointment of Mr. Fouquet and Dassen in the explanatory notes. Mr. Fouquet's appointment will commence per today. Mr. Dassen's term will commence per 1 June of this year. The personal details of Mr. Wennink, Mr. van den Brink and Mr. Schneider-Maunoury, Mr. Fouquet, and Mr. Dassen as well as the main elements of their respective contracts, including the remuneration package, are included in the explanatory notes to the agenda for this AGM. For the record, this is a discussion item, not a voting item. The appointment is done by the supervisory board pursuant to [indiscernible] and the company's Articles of Association. As stated, Mr. Fouquet and Mr. Dassen are present here today. Christophe Fouquet, please present yourself. And Roger, please introduce yourself, as well. Are there any questions about the above? We -- if -- Mr. Jorn, if you would bear with us for a moment.\nAttendees: I'm [ Herman Kipp ]. I'm speaking on behalf of the Foundation for Railway Pension Fund and Public Transport Pension Fund. We support the board of management comprising qualified individuals reflecting diversity, including gender. Unfortunately, the envisaged board of management is not diverse in this respect. We understand that this might be difficult because of the advanced technical expertise desired, but we wonder how ASML expects to safeguard additional gender diversity in the future board of management.\nExecutives: First, we agree with you. In searching for a new CFO, and we were involved in looking for a fellow board member, we had a long list comprising 12 candidates, including 4 ladies. In our interviews with the ladies, at first, 3 stated that they thought the company was too technical. And in our interview with one of the ladies before we were able to reach a conclusion, she withdrew from the procedure for the same reason at her own initiative. So the candidates -- among the other candidates remaining, Dassen was selected. We do aim for that 1/3, but this is a highly technological company and you need to feel at ease and it's not always easy to find people. They have to be available, and they have to be at ease with the company. And the market is also restricted to Europe. We could bring people from the U.S., but we can't afford them, so that's another restriction. And apart from that, the influx in the technological positions, we do want to try that and get more female employees. We get -- we have quite a few foreign female employees but Dutch female employees lack the line. Yes, that is a good addition. In R&D, especially, some 30% -- almost 35% is female, but most of those females are from abroad, from outside the Netherlands. Mr. Jorna, your turn.\nAttendees: Thank you. Jorna, VEB. Yes, Chair, did Mr. Wennink actually say that foreign CFO cannot be -- we cannot afford this?\nExecutives: No, no, no, not foreign, American, was said. American.\nAttendees: So you agree with [ Mr. von Davier ] of [ ING ]?\nExecutives: No, no, no, sir. You make a conclusion from a neutral. Mr. Wennink, I'm sure, meant to say that we do not want to have that type of -- we don't have that type of situation here.\nAttendees: Okay, I'm happy with that. So that's fine.\nExecutives: Two, accountants, CFO, CEO. They are not economists.\nAttendees: Fair enough. That's good, because they always agree.\nExecutives: So 2 accountants. Maybe that is good. And an accountant can transform into a General Manager, as Mr. Wennink has shown us. So Mr. Dassen, for his whole career has worked in accountancy.\nAttendees: So you went from the long list to the short list. Did you actually do a kind of assessment in respect of how an accountant can manage the managerial qualities because an accountant is always right after the fact, but the manager has to also know things beforehand. It requires a different attitude. We do not know in how far this person will be able to manage. The due diligence of Mr. Dassen, how was this done? Who was it done with? We understand that Mr. Wennink knows him quite well. So you know what to expect from this person but was there any further due diligence before Mr. Dassen was introduced? Final question, and really, I need to say this but do not take this personally. In the claims -- there have been many claims against auditors/accountants. Did you make sure that Mr. Dassen does not -- was not involved in any conflicting situations at Deloitte?\nExecutives: There was a very careful process. First of all, the committee and the full supervisory board, we looked at the profile, what kind of person do we want. Because the CFO must not just make sure that the numbers are crunched properly, but that he also can connect various parts of the company, the various people of the boards. Wolfgang did this very well, did this authentically and we wanted to keep that for the new CFO. So we had a profile drafted. We also had -- we had the long list, we went to the short list. And the whole management team, which is the whole board of management, and the Nomination Committee, we all interviewed 3 candidates. We did 4, you did 3, I think. We interviewed these people. Based on the interviews, we saw the differences in the qualities of the people, in their personalities. We looked at what could be the advantages, what could be the disadvantages, what were their strengths for ASML, what were their weaknesses for ASML. And after a very long procedure, with due care, all of us unanimously, both boards, support the appointment of Roger Dassen. And we worked with a third firm, a headhunter that did a lot of work, preliminary work, an independent from that headhunter, who did recommendations, who did assessments, we, ourselves, for a couple of people, who in the past worked with Roger Dassen in various positions, we got information from them directly and they made us even more enthusiastic to appoint Roger for this position.\nExecutives: And I would like to add that in the past few years, he was the Vice Chairman of a worldwide organization and that was not just being an accountant, that was managerial. So that was -- that different type of work, but also you have to look forward in that and not backward.\nExecutives: So I hope that your questions have been answered by what we just said.\nAttendees: No, there's one question still outstanding. \nWho was responsible for some international parts of Deloitte? As a person, how was -- was he actually involved in any untoward business or anything that wasn't quite kosher?\nExecutives: Well, we know nothing of this. In as far as we were able to check this, nothing was found that pointed in this direction. So I hereby note that, on behalf of the Supervisory Board, Mrs. -- that Mr. Fouquet was formally appointed effective April 25, 2018, and Mr. Dassen, effective 1 June 2018. And also, Wennink, Van den Brink and Schneider-Maunoury have been appointed. So congratulations, everyone, on their reappointment and on their appointment, which brings us to the composition of the Supervisory Board, and we have 2 voting items and one discussion item.\nThe voting items concern the proposals to appoint and reappoint certain members of the Supervisory Board. And as we announced last year, Ms. Van der Meer Morh and Mr. Stork will retire their rotation per this meeting. And Mr. Van der Meer Morh has indicated that she does not wish to be reappointed and she will resign as a Supervisory Board member. And Pauline, dear Pauline, thank you so much. Yes, she is over there, all the way there. Thank you to you, too, for what you've done in the past 9 years. You were so involved, your engagement in the Supervisory Board, but you were also a member of the Selection and Nomination Committee, and you had a very important role in that, and you were also a part of the Audit Committee. So thank you so much for what you did for us. And we will miss you as a person and we will miss your contribution to this Supervisory Board.\nMr. Stork indicated that he is available for reappointment, and the Supervisory Board has decided to nominate him for reappointment.\nAnd furthermore, the Supervisory Board wishes to nominate Ms. Terri Kelly as a member of the Supervisory Board. And Ms. Kelly is also here today, and the explanatory notes to the agenda contain the motivations for these nominations and the personal details of the candidates. The appointment of Ms. Kelly and reappointment of Mr. Stork will be effective this meeting and will both be for a 4-year period. The shareholders did not use their right of recommendation with respect to these vacancies.\nThe Works Council did not recommend any candidate for the vacancy, following Mr. Stork retirement per rotation. The Works Council has decided to use its enhanced recommendation right for the nomination of Ms. Kelly. And the Works Council was given timely -- was given time to give its opinion on the opportunity on the appointment and of the reappointment of these 2 people. So Ms. Kelly, please, would you stand up, please. Show yourself to the meeting.\nAnd again, I give the meeting -- the opportunity to put questions, if you wish to make use of this opportunity. Yes, Mr. Davis just raised his hand. He would like to ask a question.\nAttendees: Thank you, Chairman. My name is [ Stevens ]. What about Ms. Kelly's own motivation? We'd like to hear from her, why she wants to join the board.\nExecutives: So my history has been working for a highly technical company for the past -- last 35 years. My background is actually in mechanical engineering. I have been the CEO of that company for the past 13 years, and now stepping down. But don't want to retire, and so I'm very excited about what is happening at ASML and the technology. And also, I am very committed to the workforce and creating the right environment. And so I think it's a perfect match of where ASML is in the growth projections ahead and just where I think I can contribute. Thank you.\nExecutives: Thank you very much. With that, we are going to move to the appointment of Hans Stork.\nAttendees: [Foreign Language] Yes, the secretary will reopen the vote. And the secretary, Mr. Kleipool, says that the voting is now open, and Mr. Kleisterlee explains again that it is the proposal to report Mr. Stork as a member of the Supervisory Board for 4 years, that is being voted on at the moment.\nExecutives: I note that most of you have, indeed, voted, so let's deactivate the voting system and you can no longer cast your votes.\nExecutives: We note that Hans has been reappointed. Congratulations. The appointment of Ms. Kelly as a member of the Supervisory Board also for 4 years. And the operator is asked to activate the voting system. It is now open. You may cast your votes.\n[Voting]\nExecutives: Most of you have voted. So we will close the vote. We have actually now closed the vote and the result is available.\nAttendees: [Foreign Language] The chair says that we see that the proposal has been adopted. Congratulations to the new member, Ms. Kelly.\nExecutives: The Supervisory Board advises you that by 2019, there will be various vacancies on the Supervisory Board. In 2019, myself, Kleisterlee. Ms. Aris, Mr. Schwalb and Mr. Ziebart, they will all retire by rotation, and all members are, in principle, available for reappointment. The general meeting, the AGM and Works Council have the right to recommend other candidates for these vacancies. The Works Council has an enhanced recommendation right for the vacancy that will result from the retirement of Ms. Aris. And I give you now the opportunity to put questions. Mr. [ Stevens ] has just raised his hand.\nAttendees: Thank you, Chair. My name is [ Stevens ], and my organization is very much for continuity in a company. And next year, 50% of the members will retire by rotation. They are available for reappointment, you say, but things may change between now and then. What if all 4 persons say, \"No, we don't want to be reappointed. We are not available\", which would be difficult.\nExecutives: Well yes, we said we are, in principle, available for reappointment.\nAttendees: Well yes, a lot can happen in 4 years' time. So maybe you will not have 4 people available for reappointment.\nExecutives: Well, you can't change. All 4 people joined on a certain date, but we'll bear this in mind, of course, because we are going to try and do this in a more staggered way in the future. So we will continue to look for enhancement of the Supervisory Board with a more staggered situation so that we don't have the same situation that 4 people retire by rotation. So they have 4 years, first, and then 2 years for reappointment. We'll try and, as I say, stagger this a bit more, but this was created apparently at the time when we needed new blood in the Supervisory Board. There's nothing we can do about that right now at this moment.\nOkay, this was a discussion item, not a voting item. So let's continue with the next item on the agenda, which is the proposal to appoint KPMG as the external auditor for 2019. As you will have read in the explanatory notes to the agenda, KPMG accountant has done the audit for 2017, and we have had an assessment of the job done and the quality, scope and planning of the audit was assessed. Pursuant to the outcome of this survey, we propose to again put KPMG as the external auditor. And therefore, the Supervisory Board, per the recommendation of the Audit Committee proposes to appoint KPMG as the company's external auditor. Would you like to ask any questions? Specific questions will be answered by Ms. [ Smiths Lusterling ] because she is the Chair of the committee. No questions? Let's vote.\nAttendees: [Foreign Language] Secretary asks the operator to activate the voting system, which is, indeed, now open.\n[Voting]\nExecutives: I can see that most of you have voted, so in a few seconds, we'll close the system, which is actually being done now. And the result is available, so I give the floor to the chair.\nExecutives: This item was adopted, and we continue with Item 10 on the agenda, which comprises Items A, B, C and D, and we will vote on each of these items. It is an annually recurring item on the agenda, but an important one. And it is in the company's interest, and that of you, the shareholders, to be able to react quickly if particular circumstances arise for which an issue of shares is required. Therefore, the Board of Management would like to be able to issue shares when such circumstances, indeed, arise and exclude the preemption right where it is necessary to act quickly. And as an example, in [ 2020 ], we use this authorization for the acquisition of Cymer, and in 2016, for the acquisition of Hermes Microvision. It was also used for the issue of convertible bonds in the past. And the authorizations to be granted will be valid for 18 months, from today until 25 October 2019. If you do adopt the proposals of this agenda item, the existing authorizations will expire. 10A is the authorization of the Board of Management to issue ordinary shares or to grant rights to subscribe for ordinary shares in the company's share capital, for general purposes, limited to 5% of the issued share capital at the time of authorization and, of course, subject to Supervisory Board's approval. Item 10B is the authorization of the board of management to restrict or even exclude the preemption rights that are accrued to shareholders in connection with 10A of the Agenda. And this is also subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board.\nAfter this, we'll continue with 10C, which is the authorization of the Board of Management as the body to issue shares or grant rights to subscribe for shares for an additional 5% of the current share capital of the company, also subject to Supervisory Board approval. And this additional 5% can only be used on the occasion of mergers, acquisitions and/or strategic alliances. And then finally, we have Item 10D. Again, this is an authorization for the Board of Management and, in this case, it is to restrict or exclude the preemption rights accruent to shareholders in connection with the issue of shares or rights to subscribe for shares, as described on 10C. And as with the other items, this is subject to Supervisory Board approval. Nobody wishes to take the floor, so let's start voting 10A. You may now cast your votes.\n[Voting]\nExecutives: As the majority of votes have been cast, the system will soon close. Yes, you can no longer cast your votes, and we see that a majority has voted in favor. So we can continue with 10-B. And again, the operator activates the system. Please cast your votes. \n[Voting]\nExecutives: As most of you have voted, we will close the vote in a few seconds. Yes, we've got the results. We can see that this item was also adopted. 10-C is now to be voted on and the same procedure applies.\n[Voting]\nExecutives: Yes. We close the vote as the majority of votes have been already cast. You can no longer vote. The result is available. And the majority -- a majority of votes was cast in favor. Final item of the 10 is D. Please vote on D.\n[Voting]\nExecutives: We will soon see the result on the screen after the vote has been closed. And a majority of votes was cast in favor, so this proposal has also been adopted. Agenda Items 11 and 12, the authorization to acquire and cancel ordinary shares, and this is because of the flexibility for the return of capital to the shareholders. Such flexibility requires a mandate for further share buybacks and to adopt further cancellation of shares should the company decide to do so. And as you will understand, this depends on various factors, and you are advised that there is no certainty as to further return of capital or as to the timing of another potential distribution, nor as how to achieve such distribution, and this was already addressed on the Agenda Item 2. I will deal with these 2 items, 11 and 12, separately.\n11 is the proposal to authorize the board of management to acquire ordinary shares, a max of 10%, that is, and subject to Supervisory Board approval. We have listed their conditions in the explanatory notes, and that was Agenda 11. Agenda Item 11A and 11B is for a further maximum 10% with additional conditions as set out in the explanatory notes to the agenda. And the reason why we ask this additional authorization is for further flexibility in the execution of a distribution of capital to you, the shareholders. And these authorizations are requested for 18 months, from today until 25 October 2019. If you do adopt these 2 proposals, the existing authorizations will expire. And I see that nobody has a question, so let's vote on 11A, which is the authorization to repurchase up to 10% max of the issued share capital. Voting is now open.\n[Voting]\nExecutives: [Foreign Language] We are ready to show the result on the screen, and it was adopted. This item next, 11B, that is the additional repurchasing of -- or repurchasing of an additional 10% of the issued share capital. We will now vote on this.\n[Voting]\nExecutives: You can no longer cast your votes, and the result is available.\nExecutives: We see that this was adopted. Agenda Item 12 is a proposal to cancel ordinary shares, and that may be done in one or more parcels or blocks. And the number of shares to be canceled will be determined by the Board of Management, but will never exceed 20% of the issued share capital as today. No questions? Please vote on Item 12 on the agenda.\n[Voting]\nExecutives: [Foreign Language] The vote is closed now and the results are available.\nExecutives: This was adopted, agenda Item 12, which brings us to any other business. Does anyone have any questions that you wish to put? And Mr [indiscernible] just raised his hand.\nAttendees: Mr. Chair, my name is [indiscernible]. I have a question. 5G, 5G for the telecommunications industry. Do you see that other companies want more machines because 5G, the drones will be able to communicate, and they cannot do that with the use of 4G. So maybe you already have a higher demand? Whether you can deliver machines at a certain time that are kind of 5G-compliant or something.\nExecutives: Well, quick answer. It is an improvement of the 4G technology and there is a very limited number of applications for 5G at this stage, and there's hardly a business case. There will be one, but it will take a while, but it will be of no significance to ASML.\nAttendees: Chair. My name is [indiscernible]. I have a question -- well, actually, a remark. Big Data, this afternoon, it was mentioned, there's a -- it's important in today's world. Major companies, Apple, Facebook deal with Big Data. Some 80% to 70% of all Big Data is in their hands. Big Data multiply and distort one another. It plays a big role in the holistic chain. Continuously, deviations are being monitors -- monitored to correct the precision of this. In this chain, a lot of data are stored on lots of things. My question is, what about how do you control these Big Data within the company? I have another example. You have a lot of suppliers, some-100 suppliers, more than 100 suppliers. Some also are involved in research for the next generation, a lot of data. And these are not the data that we used to have, the drawings and the plans that you can file. So tell me a little bit more about this. Do you have a designated department or will you set up a designated department for Big Data? It is an issue in the world. And Oxford and Cambridge are specialized, and they warn us about this topic.\nExecutives: Okay. Big Data, there's a lot of talk about Big Data. And of course, that's a hot topic that encompasses quite a few ideas. You're addressing very -- 2 very specific aspects in ASML where we deal with the data transactions, gathering and using it in our machines. I think you could say something about that [ Martin], but the very simple answer is it's completely screened from any external disclosure. Is it one department that deals with everything overall? No, it's single policy. Until recently, dealing with these large data files was very specific, but at our initiative, its turn -- been merged into one department that handles the Big Data Lake in a standardized manner. Now a few comments about the machine. We have extensive access to the machine production data. Theoretically, we even have access to the chip design, so that we can optimize the chip. Now as for how we deal with the sensitive data, the main issue is that with the customers -- and there's a company that is still manufacturing chips for others and wants to keep all the technology internal. We design the tools to optimize this, but the data remains in the factory. And to the extent that data is necessary to run our machines, we have very specific agreements on data access, and they certainly don't consider chip layout or the wafers where it's manufactured.\nAttendees: So might it be a good idea to address this in a subsequent annual report so Big Data and how you deal with it? Or did I not read the report in detail and is it already there?\nExecutives: I don't believe that you didn't read enough our Annual Report. Yes, that's part of our entire strategic decision-making process. You're entirely right. The party that holds the data, holds the value, and that's the truth, but our data is far from straightforward. And in the years ahead, we'll certainly have to explore that with the large platform. They always call them the Googles and the Amazons in this world. I'm sure that quite a bit of water will run will under the bridge before it's clear exactly how that needs to be dealt with and it's also a social issue. What about our service engineers, the application engineers that work together with customers? They often have no access to data from outside the factory. They have to be in the data room itself to help optimize.\nAttendees: [The operator says the question was inaudible and  the answer is \"Absolutely, thank you.\"]\nShareholders: Thank you. Good afternoon, I'm Mr. [indiscernible], I've been a shareholder since 2001. I am very, very happy. First, like last year, I'd like to thank Mrs. van de Kerkhof again. And it seems to be increasingly difficult to attend this meeting, but Mrs. van de Kerkhof arranged it once again. Do I understand that Intel holds only 3% of the share and Samsung is out of the picture?\nExecutives: No, not Samsung. They still have some shares.\nShareholders: And we've had this debate in the past, too. I didn't understand entirely at that time, perhaps Mr. Wennink could explain to me once again why he is opposed to a stock dividend. That was my impression.\nExecutives: Well, yes. I've -- I get that question a lot. The stock dividend and the share premium is -- could be a very attractive option for private investors in The Netherlands. But institutionally, it doesn't really matter, because it's mainly the pension funds that want the cash dividend and if you would issue it in shares, then they have to sell it, and that cause many efforts. So it's more convenient for them to receive it in cash. 96% of our shareholders are institutional investors, so it's quite a hassle and they don't really want to deal with the hassle. Yes, but then [ Phillips ] does it by default, and Shell started doing it again in the past 2 years, and it certainly adds up. But these are shares that have been traditionally very popular among retail investors, and that's not the case in our company. So it's not attractive to you, and there's only 4% there anyway or even less. \n[Foreign Language] If there are no other questions, I'd like to thank you for coming and for your interest and for your questions. And I'm closing this meeting and invite you for snacks and beverages in the lobby outside. Thank you.\nExecutives: Before we open the official meeting, I have a few general announcements. First, please switch off your cell phone. Part of this meeting will be conducted in English, and we have interpreters for those who don't understand English, and they will interpret the English section. You can listen to the interpretation by the headset you received. This translation of the meeting is also available via the headphones. Microphones are available in this room. If you would like the floor, please state your name briefly and ask to keep your questions short and snappy. And I would -- for due procedure in the meeting, I may need to curtail speaking tongue or the number of questions. \nI hereby open the ASML Holding N.V. Annual General Meeting and welcome you as our shareholders.\nI'm going to introduce the members of the board of management. Mr. Wennink; Mr. van den Brink; and Mr. Nickl, seated next to me. And then Mr. van Hout; and Schneider-Maunoury on the front row. Also, the members of the Supervisory Board include the ladies [indiscernible] and [indiscernible]; and the Messrs.  Grose, Schwalb and [indiscernible]. Messrs. Smits-Nusteling, Mr. [ Grose ] and Mr. Schwalb are to my right on the stage and I'm also pleased to welcome Mrs. Kelly, whose appointment to the Supervisory Board is an agenda item at this meeting.  I'm also pleased to welcome Messrs. Dassen and Fouquet, whose appointment as members of the board of management of ASML will be discussed at this meeting. \nThe general meeting has been convened with due observance of ASML's Articles of Association of Dutch law and the meeting will be transmitted live via audio webcast and audio recording will be made of the meeting to draft the minutes.\nMr. Reinier Kleipool will serve as secretary to this meeting. He's a candidate civil law notary at De Brauw Blackstone Westbroek. The details of the registration for this meeting are currently being processed. Before we vote, Mr. Kleipool will report how many people are present here as shareholders or proxy holders and how many votes may be cast. Mr. Kleipool will also explain the voting procedure and will perform a test run. And he will guide the voting procedure during the meeting.\nPursuant to the provisions of the corporate governance code, the external auditor ASML KPMG is present today. On behalf of KPMG, we have Mr. [ Van Delden ] present. He will be able to answer your questions concerning the audit report on the ASML financial statements for 2017.\nNow on to agenda item 2, which is a review of the operations, the financials and the corporate social responsibility activities of the firm. And I'm pleased to hand you over to Mr. Wennink.\nExecutives: Thank you. I'd like to review 2017 rapidly with you. Of course, you've seen the financial statements. They're not very detailed. \n2017 was an excellent year, the best year in the company's history. Revenue exceeded EUR 9 billion. So net sales grew by 33% and there was a gross margin of 45%. And that was also a record annual margin. Net income grew 44% to exceed EUR 2 billion. And our earnings per share equaled EUR 4.93, that's nearly EUR 5 per share.\nIn addition, and this is important, our share in installed base services grew. Those are the services and the physical upgrade of our installed base in the field. So it grew -- that share grew by about 25% to a record EUR 2.7 billion. \nWe are the most rapidly growing section in the company aside from EUV. Now on the subject of EUV, last year, we revealed a capability of 125 wafers per hour as we indicated in the Q1 results. We had the strength of the lighting source at a level that we can generate a minimum of 125 wafers per hour. But now we're focusing on that machine's availability to minimize downtime because that machine still has some growing pains and teething troubles. But we'll talk about that and we'll work them out too, we'll resolve them.\nNow Deep UV is our bread-and-butter product. That's how we earn our daily bread. Last year, that reflected a 21% increase from 2016 and their Holistic Lithography, that we'll touch on later on, is also pivotal in a rapidly growing company. As for 2017, that was an important year. We reached an important strategic agreement with our partner, Tran Zeiss, and -- Carl Zeiss, excuse me, and that division is -- it's a truly symbiotic relationship with our partner Carl Zeiss. And that's very important because it reinforces this strategic partnership and provides a foundation for research and development procedure for the next generation of EUV machines, which will be toward the middle of the decade ahead. \nBut we received our first commissions for research and development, and those R&D systems will be -- we'll start shipping those at the end of 2021 and then continuing in 2022 and what we call the early systems will start in 2023 and '24, ramping up in the next decade so that technology will take us past the end of the next decade.\nNow capital return, last year, we returned about EUR 1 billion to shareholders, about half through dividends and half through share buybacks so that the number of shares in issue is declining. And given the share earnings ratio, it impacts the share price on the stock exchange.\nNow as for EUV, what do customers care about? They've indicated that in 2017, in Q1 2018, they've expressed confidence in EUV, and that's [ indispensable ] of the next generations of advanced chips. We received 9 orders for the -- for Q1 and completed -- we've got about 36 EUV systems in our order portfolio. In 2017, we broke EUR 1 billion in sales for the first time, and we're planning about 20 systems for this year. Our capacity is 30 systems in 2019.\nNow what matters in EUV at present? Not so much the technological question as to does it work? It works as proven by all the orders that our customers have placed with us. So it also means this is the new technology. But we have to make sure that these teething troubles that are ongoing concerning the shelf life of certain parts, it -- we need to maximize the availability of the machines for those customers. So our target is to get availability above 90%. That concerns our Deep UV systems. And in the years ahead, we want to ensure that Deep UV machines can be used with the same -- the EUV machines need to be used with the same intensity as Deep UV machines, and that means that we are ready for industrialization. We can take them industrial and have some technical milestones from last year. \nProductivity exceeded 125 wafers per hour. We've got the pellicle, that's a membrane that we attach to the photo, negative of the photomask, to avoid pollution on the mask. There was a technological issue as to whether we were capable of applying such an extremely thin membrane, such an extremely thin pellicle and it all worked. And what's also important, because the EUV doesn't work in isolation, it works together with DPV systems. And if used them together, you can make chips so that the 2 technologies align in a matched overlay. And then they work together so that the positioning accuracy of it, Deep UV machine and an EUV machine if you use 1 after the other, it's accurate to less than 1 -- 2 millionth of a millimeter. So that's very accurate usage. \nNow our product strategy. If you considered ASML 5 or 10 years ago, we did only that huge scanner in a photocopying machine. But over time, we've added many new products. And you see this holistic lithography triad. We built this projection machine. But a few years ago, we started thinking about improving the process range because you need a photo negative to use it in that appropriate -- the dedicated machine. And we call that the process scope. We call it the process window. And that helps us improve the print for our customers. And it was about 15 years -- no, nearly 20 years ago when we started this. And we took the first steps. And later on, we purchased a company such as Brion that was nearly 10 years ago.\nAnd if you know what this photo negative should look like to get the optimal print, then you want to know whether it actually works that way. So you need a way to control that process window and we thought of measurement systems, that's the YieldStar that was developed by ASML. And in 2016, we also purchased HMI, that's a Taiwanese company that develops inspection equipment to see whether the machine actually does what we think it does. And once you know that, then you can also use the measurement and inspection data to improve the process window. So then you bring that data back to the potential chip design and toward the machine because there are thousands of knobs on that machine to change settings. So there's a feedback loop to support customers in that increasing complexity that we see in the chip industry where everything becomes tinier. And this exponentially enhances calculation, power and the storage capacity. The advanced chips keep improving, but it's also increasingly complex. So to be certain that the design will end up on the chip and that we can quickly correct any defects we observe, it's very important to optimize the output. \nOver time, we have transitioned from building large cameras in photocopying machines to supplying process solutions. And that's what you see here. In 2016, we purchased HMI. And in 2017, we had the first combined machine integrating ASML technology with the HMI technology. So we've come full circle. And the first machine shipped at the end of 2017. \nNow what does this mean? We call it a holistic lithography that should -- so not just the printer, it's knowledge about the photo negative and the photomask and the measurement and inspection equipment and how they all interact. So it's holistic vision of how customers should use the tiniest little membrane on the chip. So that means that the YieldStar machine can exist alongside the HMI machine together with a Deep UV and the EUV machine. And they interact perfectly. And this is particularly important when we head to the next generation of chips. The most advanced chip now has the smallest measurement of 10 nanometers. And you can get it from 3 to 7 to 2. \nNow who are we doing this?  Of course, with our customers and with our people, our employees. One of the challenges is to keep employment up and keep the right people. \nNow if you've read the newspapers, you'll see that ASML is certainly drawing attention from qualified engineers, and our HR division processes over 1,000 applications a year. And we do need 100,000 people. But our international contingent is increasing because there simply aren't enough people in the Netherlands. We have over 100 nationalities working in this campus in Veldhoven.  At the end of the year, we had 19,200 people and 700 people came from the HMI acquisition. But at the end of Q1 2018, we're already up to 20,200 people. So that means we've added 1,000 employees. \nHow do you find them? That's a serious challenge and Sebastian was the 10,000th working in Eindhoven. You see this in the Eindhoven Daily. So that half people -- half the people work in Veldhoven and the other half work abroad. Divide that equally between Asia and the United States. \nNow let's talk about the financials. I also mention those because we are going to talk about the financial statements. As I said, 33% growth in net sales in 2017, what we call base management. So that's tending to the machines in the field, not just servicing them but also upgrading them to the next generation. Well, that's growing at pace from 1.1 million to nearly 2.7 million -- from EUR 2.1 billion to nearly EUR 2.7 billion. And we see that in absolute terms, we still have excellent revenues. But in the memory chips, we see a lot of growth in that market. \nThe market has nearly doubled and that growth is continuing. We all deal with that. And you, your children and your grandchildren will all be using the cloud. You already use it. So there are a great many data solutions and software solutions that are no longer on your PC or your tablet, no. They're basically driven and managed and processed in the cloud through huge data centers. And that means that the huge data supply needs to be processed very quickly. So demand for what we call high-power computing. \nSo systems where the chips have a fantastic computational power, that needs to be nurtured and supported by a very powerful operating memory and storage capacity because all those data need to be stored in the cloud that we want to obtain it from later on. So you need to see the cloud applications in terms of artificial intelligence, self-driving cars, virtual reality, and the traditional communication through a smartphone, your PC. Everything is driven by that cloud. So that means -- that means that the sophisticated powerful computation chips are not possible unless they're supported by very powerful memory chips. \nSo whereas in the past the memory chips market was not growing very quickly. With the advance of the cloud, you see a massive rise in these sophisticated memory chips. You saw that in 2017 and it's continuing in 2018.\nNow as for the figures, 33% top line growth, 45% gross earnings margin. That's good. And this margin takes into account that we're not really making a lot of money on EUV yet in 2017. It's even slightly negative. And of course, that depresses the gross earnings margin. But we went from -- it went from EUR 300 million to EUR 1.1 billion at a low margin, but we managed to increase that margin because the rest of the company is operating more efficiently. \nAs for the EUV margin, we are fully confident as we indicated that by 2020, it will be between 35% and 40%. 40% is a nice target, and it's a viable target. Why? Because the EUV systems, if you look outside, you see a huge factory. And last year only a few systems came from that factory. But we can get about 45 systems from them. So you can compute those fixed costs. If you have 12 systems, then the fixed -- the overhead is very high. But if you have 45, you'll have a much lower overhead. \nIn addition, by 2020, we'll have a learning curve so we'll be cutting costs. And that will also manifest. We have other more productive EUV systems, so they're more valuable. That's the third reason. And keep in mind, we have service organization, very complex machines that require dozens of people to service it.\nAnd then there's infrastructure that we need to assemble in the field. We're incurring those costs now. And the warranty period on those machines is still pending. But by 2020, they'll no longer be covered by the warranty. So if you add all of this, there's little doubt that by 2020, we'll have a margin between 35% and 40%. And compared with the projected margin for the company as a whole, that will exceed 50%.\nNow net result, one more point, R&D costs, they increased by EUR 160 million. And we envisage that same increase in 2018 when we head to the next EUV generation. First, we'll spend on R&D both at ASML and ZEISS, which we largely finance. So that will keep rising. But the top line for 2018 will be up as well due to the reasons I just told you about.\nNet income is up 44% to -- it exceeds EUR 2 billion, and as I mentioned, nearly EUR 5 per share in earnings.  Bookings value was over EUR 9 billion last year at the end of Q1. I'm sure that you can do the numbers yourself, at nearly EUR 7 billion for order portfolio at the end of Q1. So things are looking good in this company. \nNow as for cash flow, what are we doing with those earnings? At present, we have what we call free cash flow that's after all the investments and settling the financing transactions and after we invest the cash from the earnings into working capital, we have about 7% of the net earnings. That's not where we want to be, we'd like a bit more. But that's the way things are because we're accumulating working capital for the EUV ramp. That's going to cost a lot of money. And in 2017 we invested EUR 1 billion in our Carl Zeiss venture. \nAnd looking at the balance sheet, we see equity method investments. As said, that's nearly EUR 1 billion, that's Carl Zeiss. It's well-financed -- very solvent company. So we can fund that growth and cover the R&D expenses and make the necessary investments to grow that company further. \nNow as for the shareholders, last year, about EUR 1 billion was returned to the shareholders. About 0.5 million was paid in dividend -- excuse me, EUR 0.5 billion was paid in dividend and EUR 0.5 billion was paid in shares. But we had to wait until we made that payment to ZEISS. And after we did that, we resumed the share buyback. We proposed increasing the dividend to EUR 1.40. We'll talk about that later on. \nWe've also announced a new share buyback program to the tune of EUR 2.5 billion, of which the first buyback was achieved in Q1 2018 and that will continue in the quarters ahead. \nNow I'll briefly result -- I'll briefly summarize the Q1 results. The Q1 was fine, it was just above the market guidance we had set to -- we achieved EUR 2.2 billion. The gross margin was high because we booked little EUV sales in Q1. In Q2, we expect more. And the operating margin was 28%. That was looking good. And quite a good order intake to the tune of EUR 2.4 billion. \nNow outlook for Q2, we see that net sales are expected to increase to EUR 2.5 billion to EUR 2.6 billion comprising EUR 600 million for EUV. That's considerably more than in Q1 at a lower margin. The margin is in the black, but it's not the same as the Deep UV margin, and it certainly impacts gross earnings. But that will settle up in the rest of the year. So we're not worried about the gross earnings percentage for 2018. We'll get there. \nR&D costs will rise a bit because we had those next-generation orders. Those systems will cost EUR 270 million each. We've received 4 orders and we purchased 8 options on early volume systems, all yielding a potential EUR 1.5 billion cash flow. If you receive the money in the bank, that's great, but you have to work to get there. So that's why our R&D costs will take us to the next level. We're both in Veldhoven and in Germany at Carl Zeiss. We'll make our first investments.\nNow here's my last slide. Corporate governance code from 2016 was implemented as of 1 January 2017. We are entirely compliant with this code. In our view, we performed a complete review of our corporate governance structure, not only the structure, also the internal processes. And we reviewed the agreements that we reached about rules for the board of management and the Supervisory Board. We've amended those to comply with the new corporate governance legislation. And as you would expect from us, we're particularly focused on being in compliance with the applicable rules of good corporate governance. \nAnd I'd like to wrap up on this note. Gerhard will move on to the next item.\nExecutives: Fine, which brings me to you people who are here in the room. You may have some questions. And I see that Mr. Stevens has raised his hand.\nExecutives: Let's get a mic to Mr. Stevens. All the way from the back the mic comes to Mr. Stevens.\nAttendees: Mr. Stevens with the association to protect the rights of the shareholders. You've said quite a few things already about the cash flow, about results. We have a different computational method these days, and through that method, we find out that your capacity to earn back the money is quite weak. And we looked into this a bit further, and we found out what you already said, too. The new machines have a lower profit margin. And then if we look at the market, at the market for chips, and we see that there is a lower demand for smartphones, there are more chips for crypto and for artificial intelligence, supercomputers, the Internet of Things. Okay, if we look even deeper than this, we see that in the next generation machines coming up in possibly the next decade, but if you have a lower profit margin, if that is reduced, you will have to get the money to develop the new machines from the cash flow. And we'd like you to tell us a little bit more about this. Let's explain that a little bit further, please. And something else that we noted, the intangible assets, that is 60% approximately of the book value, which we feel, well, that's quite a bit, isn't it? And then let's continue with something else that you mentioned, the 80% you mentioned. Could this harm the company? Because there is less faith in the company. How do you manage this? [ It is not quite clear what Mr. Stevens means by the 80% ]. You said it's okay but that is what you say. But what does the market think? Legal disputes at the level at which you operate, you will have those legal disputes, of course. And they will be lengthy ones, no doubt. But we ask you to tell us a little bit more about the dispute that you have at ZEISS, you and ZEISS with Nikon. That has been ongoing for a while. And for us outsiders, we just read a little bit about this and hear a little bit about this, but it is very hard for us with a little bit of knowledge to assess how that is going. \nNationalities, you mentioned the number of nationalities of the employees. Well, you have mentioned that. And then maybe people do not understand one another, all those nationalities. Do you have particular people that you employ who are designated to make sure that everybody understands everything, that people work well together and that there is no conflict between people who work here? These are our questions for the time being. Thank you.\nExecutives: Thank you and Mr. Wennink is going to answer the questions.\nExecutives: Mr. Stevens, thank you so much for the context of the market. But you've already said it. I said it. We have no concerns about the market nor the market growth. Smartphones have shown single-digit growth in the past couple of years. The double-figure growth of smartphones was years ago. But it's not just the smartphones, mind you. It is also the Internet, the cloud, the cryptocurrencies, the artificial intelligence, the autonomous cars. It's all of that. It is to that window of the advanced chips, that scope, that range is becoming broader. So the demand is also increasing. And you will not be surprised to know that we have very good expectations for the growth with that potential of this company. And we have no worries to be able to earn back the investment as you will have seen and have seen in the past years. It will not stop at 2017. The profit margins of the new machines, okay, good question. You want to know more about this? I already indicated the profit margins, how we wish to get those at the required levels for the current machines. And the new machines, yes, as you said, much will have to be invested in that. But we no longer have to invest in the EUV light source. The light source was our problem. That used to be a problem but we will use the same light source. By mid-next decade, we'll have a much higher reliability than we have now. Because we have learned in addition to which we have agreements with Carl Zeiss, as mentioned. A part of their capital goods are funded, quite a big part of it. And we will get that money back. We'll get that back because we consider these 2 companies 1 business which mean that we have agreed that we are entitled to a certain return on our investments, and that return will be paid back through a lower price that we have to pay for the lenses. So for the next-generation EUV lenses, when we get those, we'll have huge mark down as a result of our investment.  So the profit margins for the new machines will be considerably better initially than those for the current EUV. So the light source is the result -- is the reason for that because we've learned and the lens price will have been adapted because of that requirement of a return on our investment. So I do believe that the cash flow, free cash flow will be able to finance this, especially because our market is growing, and we have no doubt, nor do our clients have any doubt because of course there is a reason why they've already placed the orders that they have placed. They have good faith in us. There is EUR 1.5 billion on their way from their bank accounts to ours. So they must have some faith. Yes, the immaterial assets, the 60% you mentioned, yes, true, it is 60%. And it has to come from our own equity and then you have the corrections on both sides of the balance sheet. So there's sufficient solvency, no worries. Availability of the machines, that is quite right. The Deep EUV (sic) [ Deep UV ] machine does work technically. It's not been industrialized yet. A lot of work has to be done yet because of the shelf life of the elements, the parts. If you use it for a long time, will it still have the same quality? And we have that learning curve all the time, in all transitions. We have a very detailed plan. The -- to get the availability of the machine up from the 80% you mentioned to 90%. So we have a lot of projects that are concurrent. Thousands of people are working on that in addition to our client because, of course, the client wants to use this as much as possible. So the 80% availability, we know where we stand, we know where we wish to stand. And especially in the past couple of months, the last -- the most recent quarter, there were some breakthroughs regarding the reliability of the EUV light source. We had some concerns on the mirror that catches the light, whether the shelf life would be such that it would be attractive for customers. But as I said, we had quite a few breakthroughs, and we have all faced that we can have a 90-plus percent availability. \nNext, the legal disputes that you mentioned. That has already been explained before in the financial statements. It is not uncommon, as you said, in our industry to have this type of dispute. We had Qualcomm and Apple and Samsung, and of course, tens or dozens of thousands of patents are filed by these major companies. And of course, after a while, people don't quite agree or companies don't quite agree. And these are very lengthy proceedings on very complex technology. Yes, and there is litigation and we will explain to the court that we are not worried about the validity of our patents, that they are ours, that they are unique. And we enter the battle. And of course, we have to wait and see whether the court agrees with our point of view. We do feel, of course, that the court will agree, but we'll have to wait and see. We cannot say anything else. I haven't got a crystal ball. I cannot tell you what will happen in the future. \nThen all those nationalities in our company. Yes, quite a valid commentary. They have to work together, even though they come from all corners of the world. So 80% or 85% of our staff are university-educated. And especially people who work in that field and who come from universities from across the world, they mainly speak English. Sometimes I have meetings, lunches with new staff members who join us, and their command of the English language is very good. They have an excellent command of the English language. So we speak mainly English in this company. That is the common language that we use. And it's not so much the language that is the issue, but the way of working. So we have special programs to make sure that the new hires are given a buddy, a buddy who shows them what the procedures are, what the system is, give them an explanation on what is expected from the new hires. There is transparency about the type of work they have to do and how this contributes to the work that others do. We pay a lot of attention to this. You are quite right if you don't do this, people just run around not knowing where to go. So that does have our special attention. And in the meeting that we had with the Supervisory Board, it was discussed at length, too. So yes, for that point, thank you. There's a lot of attention for this.\nExecutives: Thank you. Anyone else? On the left-hand side here.\nAttendees: [indiscernible] is my name. My compliments for your results and also for the annual report. I have some minor questions. First of all, the transition to 7 nanometers and beyond, do you agree, sir, that the total market worldwide, I think it is from 35 billion up to maybe 50 billion, and I hear reports on the intensity. They feel that it is higher than the lithography intensity of this market. But I'd like your opinion on this, sir. And the second question is something that you already mentioned. In 10 to 12 years, there's a transition to 2 nanometers. And then we get to the post-optics era. I do not know whether you're already doing any R&D into the post-optics era, but what I want to ask is what do you think of the long-term outlook with regards to those post optics. \nGross margin, 49% in Q1. So that's a wonderful result. So not just for the more modern tools but the old-fashioned tools. So high 40s, low 50s. When do you expect those for the EUV? And the final question is the innovation box. For taxes, the fiscal, how do you see the development regarding that, the taxes that need to be paid in the future? Those are my 4 questions.\nExecutives: Okay, the questions will be answered, 3 and 4 by Wolfgang. I will answer 1 and somebody else will answer question 2. The world fab-equipment market to make the chips, yes, indeed, some 50 billion, quite a considerable growth. Do bear in mind that the sales of our top line clients also had turbulent growth. And we are in a period if you look at the market in which we operate, and we have to subdivide this into 3 segments: the logic, the memory chips, which is -- which supports the logic, DRAM, and the NAND chips, the storage chips for storage of data. So those 3, you have to break it down into these 3.  And all 3 submarkets are hot, which has to do with the cloud, the Internet of Things, those developments. But if we look at the third segment, the NAND, the storage chips so to speak, we progress to a new technology. The number of bits on those is determined by the number of layers. And those layers, for that you need deposition, you need etching. And every layer has deposition step and an etching step, which means that you have to have the pattern, you need lithography parts, that storage chips is -- we have some colleagues in that market. Relatively speaking, they benefit a lot from that market. So that litho intensity as a percentage of the total CapEx, which is the money spent on this equipment, decreases. It goes down. But in absolute terms, lithography does not go down. Because if you go to all -- to the multilayer strategy, you need more deposition, you need more etch. So that's good for our colleagues. And DRAM and in logic, it's a different situation because, in those 2 segments, we have to deal with -- we have very complex designs, especially in logic, random, very complex layer of the chips, sometimes 3, 4, 5, 6 times it has to go through the machine just for 1 layer and EUV makes this very simply. We can just do it in 1 step. But if you have to do it 5 to 6 times, then you also have to have the 5 to 6 times deposition layer, etching layer. So good for our colleagues once more. But if we reduce those 5 to 6 layers to 1 and we do it through EUV machine, which is double the price, then the relative share of the EUV machine or if the lithography goes up as a part of the total costs then our colleagues go down. So you see the opposite happen, not just for logic but also for DRAM. So what you have to do, you have to look at those market segments, and in certain segments of the market, litho intensity increases and then in the other markets, there is a relatively -- a relative downturn. But overall, because DRAM and logic is the bigger part of the market, the litho intensity will increase. Thank you.\nExecutives: The post optics well, I'm very happy with the HMI orders. I'm very happy with those. So the bandwidth is different. I am -- I will function or operate until the next decade. You talk about 2 nanometers. Where do we stand today? If you buy an advanced Apple phone, there are 10 nanometers chips in there. And -- which the new technology, we feel that it is usable at 1 nanometer. Now we may speculate 10 years ahead. What could happen after 1 nanometer? But there are lots of questions. So let me not go into that right now. We are now into expanding the current EUV machines. And in the short term, as Peter says, it will simplify the processing. And that will be soon 5 to 3 nanometers. And there'll be a situation in which we will have various exposures, double patterning, which will result in more process steps, higher costs [indiscernible] through the HMA, it will go down, and there will be a new situation. And what happens after, well, I can't really tell you yet. Maybe we can talk about this sometime in the near future. But what is important over the next decade is the number of layers, the number of exposures that is required will have the imaging done with a lower resolution and will have to have a higher throughput. Those are the main things for the next decade. And this should be right, together with some processing tricks to get up to the required nanometer level. Costs, Wolfgang, EUV margin tax burden, the innovation box.\nExecutives: The gross margin and innovation box as well. Gross margin, I'll repeat part of what Peter already said. There is a big difference between our EUV business currently, although we make great progress year-over-year, and the rest of our business. So in a given quarter, you can have quite some churn. Like for instance, in Q2, we'll ship -- we'll have almost 4x the revenue in EUV than we have in Q1 and you can see we've gone from 49%, almost 49% to 43%. That will level itself out throughout the year. We've said publicly that this year, although we haven't given a specific number, that the overall company gross margin will progress from the 45% that we achieved last year, despite the fact that the EUV business is doubling in size again. So that, of course, shows that we're making progress in EUV. And we talk a lot about EUV, but we also continue to create a lot of value in the non-EUV business.  It's often forgotten that half of our R&D budget goes to non-EUV products, Deep UV, Holistic Lithography and so forth. And we continue to create value there and we share that with the customer. But we have the opportunity to increase the margins there as well. We've spelled out quite specifically, and Peter mentioned the 4 criteria: volume, cost, mix and then the service business, how we get in the zip code of 40% gross margin by 2020, I think it's very feasible if we achieve the volumes and the tool does what it's supposed to do. That's very feasible. And that will enable us as a company to cross the 50% mark, which is our milestone for 2020. Beyond 2020, we have never said that we stop at 40% for EUV. We'll continue to make the tool better. We'll have more throughput. There will be newer versions of the tool. And then I think we also said that the inherent gross margin of high-NA by its value proposition is potentially higher than what the pre-high-NA EUV does. So we're pretty comfortable that we can continue to increase the gross margin of the company over the next couple of years. \nNow as it relates to the innovation box, many governments in the world do have tax systems that support innovation, because, from an economic standpoint, that is what drives growth in those countries. It's not just the Netherlands. There's also tax credits, research tax credits in the U.S., for instance, as you know. The innovation box has been adjusted last year, also based on OECD rules. So the Netherlands has also adjusted the innovation box. And we're happy that we qualified again for the innovation box. Just as a reminder, ASML declares about -- more than 80% of our profits in the Netherlands, and it's clearly viewed as a win-win what we do here because, for every job we have at ASML, we believe there are 3 to 4 jobs in the supply chain. Universities prosper. There's lots of incremental growth for society. We got it prolonged, the conditions for those of you who are in the details have adjusted a little bit. So the advantageous tax rate is 2% higher than it used to be, but it's still advantageous. And we were able to get an agreement for 7 years. And that is supporting us with our overall model where we think in the 2020 timeframe, we'll continue to be at about a 14% tax rate for the company. So we're quite pleased with that situation.\nExecutives: Thank you, Wolfgang. Then we move up 1.\nAttendees: Thank you, chair. My name is André Jorna on behalf of the association of stockholders, in the Netherlands chair. It seems as if the trees grow up as far as heaven. They reach the sky and the sky is the limit. And you wonder about disruptive developments. And Mr. van den Brink may have seemed to have pointed it out already after the 1 nanometer. But if you live here locally, you hear from the TU in Eindhoven, the technical university, you hear about the photonic chip that they are developing, and the photonic chips is through light. And it is the processing of the major data, the big data. And Internet with the major data centers, you already mentioned the cloud. We need a lot. And with those photons that respond differently than electrons, especially with respect to light, they would be faster, less energy. They could even be sensors. So the machines that you have, can these machines really supply the industry for when the photonic chips are going to be made? So if that day comes, will the machines, the EUV and the high EUV, will they be able to handle this? That is my first topic. And then two, you are way ahead of the competition, way, way ahead. And with the current knowledge that you have and the range of machines, you are 100% monopolist, the high-end pricing power. How can you use that in EUV? You said you get a discount or markdown at Carl Zeiss. Do you also give discounts to those major partners of yours, Samsung, TSMC, Intel? Do they get a discount on the EUV machines or do you take things easy and by 2020 you think, we'll get the profit then? So the pricing power of the EUV machines, things go very fast. You do not want to have any wasted assets, and you, of course, want to get a return on your development investments. And then I have another question. The role of diminishing returns is -- we see that the machines become more complex. They cost a lot of money. They become more and more expensive. And there could be less demand. It's not for a mass-market, of course, that consideration. Is that something that you talk about or are you just going to wait and see what will happen? That is maybe something that you can't tell. Mr. Nickl, the CFO, likes risks, but controlled risks, I understand. So I'm quite curious to know as to your risks. The production capacity, you do not say, no, we haven't got it. But you say I've got a delay. It's later, but later could be counterproductive. You invested in Carl Zeiss, you bought some companies. Is it possible the production goes up to 40? Can it be higher than that? Or is that not something that the market requires? And then my final question for now, in the past 2 to 3 weeks, we've had a bit of a fright regarding what we hear about the chips industry. You say those analysts, all nonsense because the chip [ cycly ] -- [ cyclists ] haven't got those anymore, forget that. And some companies have to give a profit warning. I saw Mr. [ Lobizo ] -- oh, it was TSMC with the profit warning and [ Lobizo ] said, \"Don't worry, things are fine.\" But still, you hear these things and then you hear that the chip industry is past its zenith. Can I sleep quietly tonight?\nExecutives: Well, you should. You should sleep without any worries. Okay, we see that there's disruption throughout the room. Now following up on what I said about post optics, I think it will remain optical even after 1 nanometer. As for photonic chips, I think that our customer is thinking about different types of technologies not only photonic chips. We're also talking about quantum computing, different computer architectures. So we see that customers are looking for different architectures to boost their system performance. We believe that whatever the technology becomes, it will always, for cost reasons, it will always include miniaturizing the connections. Secondary is how those connections are made. What matters that in all cases, you need to apply those connections photographically. That's our stock and trade. We want to do things as small as possible not only in dimensions. We also want to maximize accuracy, and we want to do so as quickly as possible. We believe this is generic for any technology, and the innovation that you mention as well as other innovations will ultimately benefit total volume and total lithography demand. So we don't believe that -- we don't believe it's possible to make these advanced chips in large volumes without involving lithography. And of course, our counterparts will need the right material. But we'll keep at it. Now I have 1 comment about the next questions related to this and after that, we'll discuss the finances. You asked about the value of boosting performance. You mentioned 270 million High-NA and that's quite curious winning those High-NA orders. And charging that price -- it's not just because of our pricing power that we can -- we can also rationalize that the performance improvement of the machine, the productivity has increased the value such that the price is rationalized. And the technology is so complex that we need bigger coverage to ensure the margin. And the question is also is the machine worth the technology? And we have to work all that out before we develop the machines. And if we are developing such a large machine, we need to know that the machine is worth it so that we won't run into problems once the machine is there. And that's the value of the orders from big customers. And I'll hand you over to my fellow board members now.\nExecutives: Excellent, Martin. That's a wonderful run up to answering questions 2 and 3, the questions about pricing power and the law of diminishing returns. Martin explained it very clearly. The way -- this is how we've always done the pricing. When I joined ASML, the most expensive machine cost EUR 5 million. We just sold a machine for EUR 270 million and the customer is still buying it. And this is because of Moore's law, because Moore's law is an empirical law of economics. You have the cost per function every few years. So the cost per function per transistor 20 years ago when I arrived, the machine at EUR 5 million, those costs were considerably higher than what the customer calculates as cost per transistor for the EUR 270 million machine that will be operational in 2025. That's an exponential reduction in costs, and that's exactly the cost of the machine. If you use a logarithmic scale to calculate the cost reduction, if we can calculate what lithography adds to those costs then you would say of the cost reduction half will borne by ASML and half by the customer. That's always been our principle. And basically, we've been able to increase the price from EUR 5 million to EUR 270 million, and we still sell. It's true that fewer machines are sold, but that's simply because the transistor density because of the continuous miniaturization, density is increasing exponentially as is the productivity of the machine, so you don't need as many machines. But each machine becomes far more expensive, so that's the ASML top line. As for discounts, we sell the current EUV machine at 100% capacity. It's not yielding that yet, so you can say customers are getting a discount. But the way we put that pricing together relates to sharing the cost benefit. And we've always priced that way and we'll continue doing that in the future. As for the question about production capacity. Now it's 40 to 45 systems, which will continue in the different chains. We'll reduce throughput time in the factory as much as possible, because if we can use the same square meters, you can build more machines if you accelerate throughput times. So this is the most economic approach. If we needed higher numbers, let's say, we need 60, then we'll need to increase production capacity. I'm talking in terms of square meters. That's not relevant yet, but it depends on how successful we are and how many more EUV machines we need to build. We need that run-up time of 2, 2.5 years to increase capacity levels. And once we get there, we'll have the prospect book higher sales. Now the last question, this an update on the check industry. Despite what my predecessors said, I'm not going to say that there are no cycles in the semiconductor industry. That's logical. I'll give you one example of the different segments. The DRAM segment for the memory chips, there are 3 suppliers for that. A better example. Look at the mem chips. Those are the storage chips, they're [indiscernible] [Audio Gap] that's 5 suppliers for those Intel, Toshiba, Samsung, Hynix and Micron. If each of them decides to build a new factory at the same time, those are huge factories that cost between $5 billion and $8 billion each. And let's say that they are all competed at the same point, then you get a step of a huge increase in capacity. Now the bit demand increases by 40% to 50% a year, so you'll grow quickly there. But temporarily, in the short term, it may lead to surplus capacity and the market will react to that. But as for the medium and long-term and the TSMC story, it's not just that the smartphones are less, but the high-powered computer chips that go to the server parts or the data centers and -- they continue powering the cloud. That demand is ongoing. And as for TSMC, we are investing more in our 7- and 5-nanometer machines. Why are they doing that? Because if you look at the Apples and the Oracles in this world, that has a huge window. There are a vast number of applications for that chip. So in the medium term, we can invest more because we envisage growth. So that's justified. Whether you have a short-term view or medium to long-term view, the short-term view will focus on temporary surplus capacity in a certain segment, or in the medium term, they shouldn't -- you don't worry about that.\nAttendees: [Audio Gap] Executive and Non-Executive Representatives and of course, also all other ASML employees. My name is Denise Reike, and I represent De Vereniging van Beleggers voor Duurzame Ontwikkeling, or in English: Dutch Association of Investors for Sustainable Development. We consist of 60 institutional and over 600 private investors who support our aim to make the Dutch capital market more sustainable. And for many years now, we have been visiting ASML's AGMs as an opportunity to point to diverse stakeholder groups, your sustainability achievements made over the past year, but also of course as a possibility to further drive corporate sustainability implementation within ASML in our role as share and stakeholder. So I have 2 questions. But before that, may we -- let me make a small remark that we were a bit surprised about the relatively short item of sustainability on the agenda. Maybe, we're going to hear more about implementation of the Code but we were hoping to also see other topics addressed this year. The question that I have regards 2 topics. One is energy consumption and the other one is the payment of a living wage in the supply chain. ASML has a 10% energy savings target for 2020, taking 2015 as a reference year. And we've seen that in 2017, savings that -- and '16, a saving of 35.1 and 48.8 terajoule have been achieved. But on the other hand, on Page 174 of the annual report of this year, we find that energy consumption regarding your own operations has increased and also, significantly, compared to 2015 levels. So since 2020 is not so far away, we are wondering how sure is ASML to actually meet this target of absolute reduction compared to 2015 levels also, given the growth that we're seeing currently. In the report that we can read that you are being on track, which is not the same confident formulation that we have also heard regarding some other items today. So we were wondering how will you assure to meet this target. And also, have you already looked into energy targets beyond 2020? And regarding the living wage, I would first like to compliment you because you've made an explicit reference in the annual report that you support this concept. And we were glad to see that. We understand that within ASML directly, and luckily, living wages are not an issue and probably also not in the first supply chain tier with suppliers such as Carl Zeiss. However, we think that looking at the wider supply chain, this might well be an underaddressed issue. And as ASML has repeatedly recognized its responsibility when it comes to deeper supply chains, for example, with the conflict-free mineral initiative engagement, we are wondering how informed is ASML regarding payment of a living wage deeper in the supply chain? For instance, when it comes to this initiative or also beyond. And do you see a role for yourself in further driving this point on the agenda; for instance, in the former EICC or through owned initiatives such as an inclusion of this as a requirement in your supplier Code of Conduct?\nExecutives: Okay, there are many, many questions of 2 main questions, so there're a lot of sub-questions. I think first on the 2015, or let's say, the 2020 target with reference to 2015, you're absolutely correct. The 10% is our target. But I have to say that you are correct that in absolute terms our energy usage will go up for the simple reason that the EUV machines will actually need more energy, and then -- because the number of EUVs will actually grow, and we need to test them and they actually take a lot of energy. That is inherent and at -- in the design of it because we use high power CO2 lasers to regenerate EUV light which, where the conversion efficiency is -- let's say, is undeniably low, and there are physical limitations of how much you can drive that conversion efficiency up. Now you have to say that the EUV machines are very important for the total ecosystem because by shrinking the transistors on the chip, the energy usage of the chip will go down significantly. And as you know, I'm pretty sure as you know, that when you look at the advanced data centers, they are enormous users of energy. So more advanced chips will actually drive the energy consumption down but you need, unfortunately, an EUV system for it that initially needs a high energy input. But I think the equation, from a broader perspective, gives a very positive business case, you could say, on the use of EUV systems and further shrink. Now that doesn't mean that we're not working at lowering the energy usage of those systems, which will be part of the further designs of those tools. So there will be a further reduction of the energy usage or the -- let's say, the conversion efficiency driving that up. Now having said that, well, it is inevitable that we will, with the growth of the EUV business, start using, in absolute terms, more energy. We are focusing on reaching our target of 100% renewable energy by 2020. And currently, we're at 72%. Now how do we do that? We are sourcing this through the guarantee of origin projects, where we make sure that we buy renewable energy, those labels are actually there. Yes? So why we cannot avoid, as a higher usage, the focus on renewable energies and also the funding of what we call the guarantee of origin projects which we do, yes, will enable us to at least have a significant contribution to this issue. And the target is beyond 2020. Yes, we are formulating currently targets beyond 2020. It has to do with the fact that we are really looking at the focus areas of our sustainable strategy as defined by the United Nations framework whereby, basically, as we are looking at what the most relevant items are of that framework as to -- as it relates to the ASML strategy. And that will determine, and it's probably going back from 9 to 5 focused areas where we are currently defining the 2025 strategic targets. And when we think about this and the SDGs of the United Nations, the Sustainable Development Goals that have been formulated, I think we're basically focusing or we'll very likely focus on the 5 most important ones. And I think it's the quality of education whereby people development and training is extremely important. We furthermore have what we call the decent work and economic growth in our goal, which is the co-development with the suppliers. It actually relates to your second question.  We have to make sure that all our suppliers, and we are making sure that all our suppliers are part of the Responsible Business Alliance and they have signed that Code. Industry and innovation as a third SDG whereby industry innovation and the way that we innovate is very much driven by our open innovation concept, which is very typical to ASML whereby, for instance, our R&D charge, which this year is significantly over the -- close to EUR 1.3 billion of last year is shared in the supply chain, about 45% of our R&D is not with ASML. It's with our partners and our suppliers. SDG 12 was about the responsible consumption and production that focused very much on the circular economy. Now we have or close to 100%, over 99% of our parts are -- sorry? So 99% of our parts are actually recirculated. Our tools in the field, we have special upgrade programs to make sure that they are not decommissioned and that they're actually reused and they're upgraded to the next level of performance. And on the climate action, we talked about it. This is about the energy efficiency of our products, about the conversion efficiency focus we have in EUV. And I think, making sure that the electricity that we use is 100% renewable. And those out of the 5 -- I think the 5 core areas of focus that we will put into our sustainable strategy going forward. And that will lead to 2025 targets that we will share with you in our next integrated report. We need to define those targets as a board, and we need to agree with them with our senior management group, but that will be the result of the work that we will do this year. On your question of the living wages, I will go back to what I said earlier. It's one of the target areas of the SDG focus that we will have going forward. It is very much part of our focus of -- on our supply chain and where we do our supplier audits. The supplier audits involve not only quality logistic technology and cost but also a fifth element we just called sustainability, and we require that our suppliers are part and have underwritten the code of the Responsible Business Alliance, which, of course, needs to support the whole concept of a living wage. Now you ask a question about how deep does our insight go into the supply chain. It doesn't stop at Tier 1. It very often goes down to tiers 2 and 3 and even 4.  It depends a little bit on what we are buying. But what we are buying generally is technology that is developed and manufactured in countries that are subscribing to the sustainable development goals and actually companies that are public companies and have underwritten those goals. So for our suppliers, it is a requirement to underwrite those -- the Responsible Business Alliance code papers, but it is not a major issue for them because it is very often part of their sustainable strategy already. So we happen to have a supply chain that doesn't operate in areas where a living wage is a real issue. That is an advantage of this company, but also we make sure that our suppliers live up to the Code.\nExecutives: Thank you, Peter. The next question?\nAttendees: I'm [ Terry Yeltson ]. I'd also like to compliment you on those figures. It's great that you manage to sustain those year-after-year. I was wondering in recent months. Of course, ASML learns from technological breakthroughs in physics, chemistry and mathematics. And can you tell me about other factors? Do your errors in accelerations relate to embedded software? Because I imagine there are millions of codes in those machines. So in other words, is it that the problem relates to physics or the chemistry or is it -- does the problem also relate to computer science? I think that Mr. van den Brink is the best person to answer that, but I do note that the EUV machine has 51 million lines of code, so that's quite a challenge.\nExecutives: Martin?\nExecutives: I would like to say that building machines comprises many different disciplines, not just physics. I would say that straightforward machine building involves many different elements and even more software than the 50 million lines of codes. But what we've been working on in recent years is that expanding to greater automation and Mr. Wennink showed you our holistic triad in lithography with machines at the top and computational lithography at the bottom and other computational features. So in California and in China, there are software developments that make it possible to simulate chip production and that's not a panacea, it involves extremely sophisticated software and that simulation needs to be calculated. We use self-learning algorithms for that, that can optimize the entire process. So we see a growing role for software but it's not -- it's the integration between the software and the hardware. They need to be aligned. You can almost say that's the secret of our technology. We have another question at the left there.\nAttendees: Mr. Chairman, I'm Mr. [indiscernible] from Amsterdam. I have a question based on the annual report. It is very readable, but I still have a few questions, that the message of the CEO, because you're right that there is increasing scope of application for semiconductors. That's true. And you mentioned that you -- that wonderful products need -- require good employees and ASML depends on them. That's also true. But then, in the [ updated ] Dutch Financial Daily on 21 April, 2018 there was a remuneration specialist, [indiscernible], who explained that to some extent, money is secondary. It's the nonfinancial aspects that carry the most weight in considering job changes. Then, I look on your website, and I see a vast number of vacancies. I'm not sure why you didn't find candidates for them. Is it because of those nonfinancial aspects? And at ASML, you're aiming to achieve more -- a lot smaller, more powerful and more energy-efficient but -- and more cost-efficient, too. But I'm wondering is why are there so many unfilled vacancies in your company? Is it because of the people in your organization? I'd like to face-off with you about that. Perhaps, do you need to offer some nonfinancial incentives? I'd like you to tell me more about that. And of course, this morning, I read the Dutch Financial Daily and that was quite a shock because Mr. Nickl is leaving. Couldn't you retain him for the nonfinancials? I thought that was a pity. But then I read on, and you also have the most patents because of your technology, and there are at least 2 people in your organization who are being considered for a wonderful award. So that's good news. But I think it sad that Mr. Nickl is leaving.\nExecutives: Okay, duly noted. We agree but we stand an excellent success in Mr. Dassen.  We'll tell you more about him later on.\nAttendees: I'm not there yet, but I'd certainly like you to tell me who is in charge of nonfinancial aspects.\nExecutives: Okay, first Mr. Wennink will talk about the growth of ASML, the contingent of employees and our pace in filling vacancies.\nExecutives: Unfilled vacancies. This is mainly to do with the fact of timing, because at the moment, we have an annual run rate as we call it. So the vacancies in the past 12 months, actually, I should say the job applicants, more than 100,000, but we only need a couple of thousand. So we have to be very selective. Yes, we need people but we need to right people and that financial part only a very small part, you're quite right. And of course, we pay good wages. No doubt about that. We pay well. But people in Silicon Valley, they come to ASML because they've had it to make emoticons for WhatsApp. So they'd rather make algorithms, complex machines such as we make. And maybe they've entered here through, or maybe you've entered here through the Plaza and that is a great place for all those hundreds of nationalities or more than 100 nationalities to meet those people. So it's not just how much you earn but also what you get, what you experience. And we have a very low churn rate. People stay because it's not just the financial reward. It is what they do, with whom they work, what the company is like. And yes, we still have a lot of vacancies because it takes about 3 to 4 months before you find the right people. So we always have some vacancies. There will always be some vacancies. We'll never have every spot filled, but our HR department is convinced that with those major influx of people that apply for jobs because apparently, we have a very good reputation as an employer, so it's not going to be any trouble to fill the vacancies that we wish to fill. We will be able to do that.\nExecutives: Thank you, Peter. So the nonfinancial benefits of ASML are quite good, the fringe benefits. And Mr. [indiscernible] speaks but without use of the mic so he's not quite audible to the interpreters. Okay, that is not a problem. The average age is very stable. We have a lot of new hires from universities so they make sure that the average age is a bit lower than the average age that you see here behind this desk. We're a bit older than the average employee is.\nAttendees: The next question, I read in the past couple of weeks that China has an emphasis for the next 10 to 20 years of the production of chips. My question to you, which is an inevitable question I feel, how do you view the development? And what is your position in this? And my second question is I hear that you developed software in China, and the -- what about the intellectual property rights of ASML and the parties in China that you work with?\nExecutives: By the way, that last bit is not right. That's not so. It is not a condition, so that doesn't bother us. \nSo disregard this because that's not the situation. So China, how do you view China?  \nQuite evident, I would say. I think that as indicated in the 5-year plan, they are going from being the sweatshop of the world to top-end value-adding, and it's been made very clear that the semiconductor industry and the chip industry is essential in this. They will invest some [ EUR ] 200 billion in the local Chinese industry, and we participate significantly. In our most recent quarterly report and our conference call with the analysts, out of the 15 plants, 7 are in China. We participate in all, so we have a very significant part in this. And that is necessary to develop the chip industry, you need advanced lithography. And we have good agreements on this with our Chinese clients. So as far as I'm concerned, it is a good thing but how fast will they develop? Because if you want to be a player in the advanced chip industry, you have to have the advanced process technology, advanced technology to have the chips do what they need to do, which is not necessarily the case in China. Yes in Taiwan, Korea, United States, among other countries where, of course, they look and see what happens in China for the protection of the intellectual property. That is an issue, of course, between the United States and China and, of course, these are things that we monitor very closely and -- I can't say anything about this, no restriction whatsoever at the moment. But what the future brings, we'll see in the future. China, no doubt, is ready, especially in the next decade to be a player in the advanced technology, and we are also ready to be a major player. Who else would like to say something? Mr. [indiscernible] is up.\nAttendees: I've got to ask 2 further questions. The business plan. In the bad times, you survived because of the flexible model of the business plan. But more and more do you invest in the trades, [ Sima ], Carl Zeiss, [ HMI], so your business plan is not as flexible as it used to be. Also, because the employees that you have, you want to retain them and that is by getting fewer flex employees and more permanent employees. So what about the future? Everything's going up, it's on the up, but what if we have another downturn? Will you be flexible enough? Second question is that I had to really try and find out what the portfolio is like, the order portfolio and what it comprises. I understand you're not going to share this with us anymore? Why not?\nExecutives: Right. Your first question. The flexible model, you're quite right in '08 and '09, the financial crisis. At that time, we used that flexibility. But still 80% is in the supply chain, and we still have a lot of flexible staff members or flex employees. The company is growing fast. So some flexible employees who've been working here for quite some time and who are performing well, you'd like them to be in a permanent position, and that's why you see the conversions. This is a situation that will remain. And don't forget in 2009, our market share was between 50% and 60%. Now it is higher so the technology transection always continues through the cycles. It's always the most advanced technology. And if we look at all over sales, it is mainly through that advanced technology. I can't tell you here but it is a lot. So that is a good foundation. So we still have that flexibility. It's a little bit less, fair enough. But on the other hand, our market share increased quite considerably. And then the order portfolio. Our colleagues in the industry applied research and others don't share the portfolio, the order portfolio. And the reason why is that we have a limited number of customers, and the way in which we plan our business, it is not traditionally based on the orders because, for advanced lithography, the clients come to us. And the client needs us to have the right machines ready for them at the right time. So it is a different production planning and a sales planning. It's a very -- we have a very integrated relationship with our customers. The plans of our customers for the next 18 months are discussed between us and them on a weekly, sometimes on a daily basis. And this means that we can check what -- how our machines connect with theirs. We look at the pedestals which are where -- on which the machines have to be assembled, and these things take months. So we know exactly what the client is doing, what the customer is doing. And if this is not clear and transparent, we have to second-guess and we will be wrong. So we have to have a very close cooperation so the order is mainly the end -- actually, the end of the process. So the procurement department of Samsung gives us a lot of orders and sometimes it's TSMC. The financial market concludes [ strengths ] from this that are not justified because they do not understand the background of this system. It is the end of an administrative process, and it takes us weeks to explain this to outsiders. And I'll be honest, we don't talk about the long-term vision and the order portfolios with the shareholders. The institutions want to know this. They look at the shorter term and they want to understand -- analysts also want to understand. The real -- the true story is that the way in which we sell is not like the traditional driving of the order intake. And our colleagues in the industry said some time ago, okay, too much volatility, not going to do this anymore.\nExecutives: Thank you, Peter. And the Chairman says, I see that it looks like all your questions have been answered, which means that I'll go to the Secretary.\nExecutives: Thank you, Chair. And on the registration date of this meeting, the outstanding number of shares of EUR 0.09 was 431,467,000 or something. And the company has a number of treasury shares, and the number of outstanding was, therefore -- outstanding amounts, was [ 426,558,060 ] for the shares. As one, it's about ordinary share entitles to 9 votes that will be 38,839,022,567 votes that may be cast. And at the beginning of this meeting, we had 2,322. And the total number of shares that was either represented or present is 3,325,123,695 -- 2 billion -- in excess of 2 billion votes may be cast during this meeting, and that means that 76% of the issued share capital is represented here at this meeting including Intel, which is one of the partners in the investment program, which represents 3.2%. And the agenda of this meeting does not have any items based on which the Intel can vote based on that partnership program. As an excess of 50% of the share capital is at this meeting, all voting items on the agenda may be adopted with the simple majority of the votes cast. Agenda item 3 is a discussion of the implementation of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code 2016. As Mr. Wennink already indicated in one of his slides and after a thorough checking and from adaptation, we came to the conclusion that we are fully compliant with the Dutch Corporate Governance Code. And as he discussed it, I see that there are no questions on this topic which means that we can now go to the number -- next item of the agenda which is the implementation of the Remuneration Policy 2017. We must discuss this separately before we adopt the financial statements. And this is on the current remuneration policy on 2017. And it is an item to be discussed. We're not going to vote on this, as you also saw in the agenda and into the explanatory notes. Mr. Schwalb, you will give us an explanation on this I understand. Thank you.\nExecutives: Is the mic on? Can you hear me?\nExecutives: Yes. Yes.\nExecutives: Because it shows a red light so I was confused. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This report is on the policy implementation which we all approved, you approved last year and it applied already as for the full year. So that happens for the base salary and the STI. The long-term incentive, because the targets were set in 2015, I come back to that, of course, still follow the old policy because it needs 3 years to get into the new policy. Now the base salaries last year were not increased for the board of management. I think we discussed it already last year. For the short-term incentive, the payout reached a total of 91% of maximum, which is about 89% of the base salary. We have 5 targets, each rated 20%. The qualitative performance criteria, which are the technology leadership index and market position. One was achieved between target and maximum performance level, and the other one at maximum. This information is new. It is the first time that we inform you in that detail about the achievements. We never did that in the past, so this is for the first time on your [ visage ]. On the financial performance criteria, we informed you last year that we had 3. The EBIT margin, the EUV shipments, and free cash flow. And you see here on the slide that the first and the last were 150% payout of target, which is max, and the EUV shipments were at target. So below max, obviously. You also find, as promised last year in the annual report, I think it's Page 149, the financial targets set for this year, not the numbers of course because those we will not publish, but which targets we chose and they are basically the same as for 2017 i.e., EBIT margin, EUV shipments and free cash flow.\nNext slide. On the long-term incentive. As I said, but this still follows the old policy according to targets set in 2015. So you don't find, for example, total shareholder return there, which is part of the new policy. But the first targets were set last year. So the first time we will discuss results will be in 2 years from now. \nWe had 3 targets on the old policy. That was a qualitative target, which is a combination of sustainability and technology leadership index over 3 years. That was evaluated at 94% of max. On the return on average of invested capital, the old system was foreseeing a comparison with a peer group of basically all U.S. companies, and it was the question of where do we rank in that list. Now we discussed last year already that this is a quite complex process and there's a lot of distortion in that system. The mathematical calculation leads us to a result leading to a payout of 63% of max. The combination of this with a qualitative target leads to a total of 69%. Now the supervisory board felt that this result does not really reflect properly the enormous success and development of the company in the last 3 years. And therefore, for the first time, we used our discretionary power, which is part of the remuneration policy, and increased the vesting level to 75% from the 69% which was the mathematical results. So we increased it by 6% points. Why is it so complicated? Yes, it's -- for example, one thing which distorted the results a lot, quite significantly even for some companies, was the U.S. tax reform introduced end of 2017 and finding its way into the financial results of, of course, all the U.S. companies but also to a smaller extent into ASML's financial results. That is something you cannot plan and not foresee. Then of course, another element was one company in the list made tremendous and partly, I must say also, how they accounted for it, quite strange restructuring steps. And yes, last but not least, we invested a lot of -- in our acquisitions with HMI and also ZEISS last year. So all of that distorts the results quite significantly. That's why we felt this discretionary adjustment to 75% of max is justified. Now I think in hindsight, I'm even more glad that in the new policy, as of 2017, '18, '19 target period. So in 2 years to be judged the results that we changed from this return on average invested capital versus peers to an absolute target based on our long-term financial plans. That I hope will be much clearer and easier to evaluate. Having said that, this is basically the report. Next year, of course, we will still have to live with the old system and its complications. So we'll see what another year will bring but it will not be easy again. I can already know, not promise but I expect it. Let's see. Any questions?\nExecutives: Thank you very much for the detailed explanation. Are there any questions from the audience with respect to the way the Remuneration Committee has implemented the existing policy? If not, thank you very much. All these end up with [ results ] have been crystal clear. \nI move to point 4b. And 4b is the discussion of the board's report and also the proposal to adopt the financial statements of the company for 2017. We have an integrated report in both the financial and nonfinancial details. And again, we have 2 integrated -- we have 2 financial statements. One, based on the IFRS -- sorry, on U.S. GAAP and 1 based on the IFRS, which we use in Europe. The integrated report based on IFRS and Dutch Law is submitted to you. And you were able to take cognizance of this, to inspect it because it was available at the offices of the company and was published on our website. Mr. van Delden of KPMG is present here today, and he will give you some insight into KPMG's audit activities for us in 2017. And any questions regarding the audit may be answered by Mr. van Delden. I give the floor to your Mr. van Delden.\nAttendees: Thank you. As Mr. Kleisterlee said, indeed, 2 reports for which we issued the certificate, the U.S. GAAP and the IFRS. And it gives you some insight into the effectiveness of the -- all the details. And as was mentioned the 2 different ones. And we have done the work, has resulted in a statements that says that everything was done okay. We have some 7 pages of explanations. And I'd like you to refer to that part. I would like to highlight 3 things. Of course, ASML is a global company with centralization here in Veldhoven, of much of the work, which means that the Dutch team has done the group audit mostly from the Netherlands. So the global audit was done mainly here, apart from Carl Zeiss. So because of the centralized position, we can have wide coverage. Some 90% of the assets are part of direct auditing and some 90% of the revenues we can have a review of. Our certificate also gives an insight in the key audit matters, the KAM. They get special attention. We had 2, in the past year, key audit matters and that is the revenue recognition. There are major contracts that are subdivided into smaller contracts. You have to link them right, amounts to the right contracts. And of course, you have to do the recognition in times, not too early, not too late but at the right time. We looked at many contracts, and we're happy with what we found. Secondly, we looked at ZEISS' major investment in the past year, a major amount, and that was one of the reasons why we looked at it in detail and it is also quite a complex contract because it is not just the investment but also an R&D corporation, so we've spent a lot of time on these 2 items, and that's all I want to say so far. Does anyone have a question on this part, this item of the agenda? And Mr. [indiscernible] has a question and the mic is handed to him by Mr. van Delden so that's easy.\nAttendees: There were legal issues and you didn't say a lot about specialists and I'd like to know a little bit more about, especially, legal specialists. And in addition to this, there is another item, another legal item which I would like you to tell me more about. Please elucidate me on this, the qualitative, quantitative side?\nExecutives: Tell me what you expect.  Of course, if we need specialists for the audit, we employ those. And you talk about the legal issues. Of course, we talk to management. We talk to in-house legal counsel and for any major matters we request lawyers' letters, which means that these are letters from lawyers that give an insight or that give their views. And in addition to those letters, we also spoke to external council for major issues. And we used that input and the legal matters, the major ones, I feel, were explained properly in the financial report. Does that answer your question, sir?\nAttendees: [indiscernible]\nAttendees: The legal positions. 2 things you should know. First of all, you have to look at probability. Will money flow out from the company? And secondly, you have to have reliable estimations. In major cases, that is important, so we agree with the position of the management as we put forward. Yes, we agree with management. Yes, true. Yes, that is right.\nExecutives: Mr. [ Stephens ] is not audible but a mic is on its way.\nAttendees: Mr. Wennink just gave an explanation on that. I told you what we did and, of course, the outcome is never certain, but as it is included in the report as it has been explained, I think that that is sufficient.\nExecutives: I reiterate. It is more likely than not that there is going to be an obligation. If it is not probable, that's okay, end of story. But you have to be able -- if it is the case, you have to be able to quantify it and sometimes it cannot be quantified. It could be 0. It could be a lot that is at risk. Who knows? Because you can't tell what the judge, what the court is going to do. So we looked into the legal issues and we concluded that we do not need additional quantitative provisions. External legal counsel agrees, the auditor agrees, Mr. van Delden has just said that looking at all the facts, he agrees and that's it.\nAttendees: Yes, but there's case law.\nExecutives: Well, yes, but that's other cases. So that is not our case. Case law is in the past. Case law is for the court to look into, but it's no help for us to quantify. Case law is in the past. Everything that we could do was made or could make available was made available to you in the annual report.\nExecutives: Yes, but I want to turn it into a [indiscernible].\nExecutives: But we can't. We can't. Well, Mr. Stephens, maybe you can give us an indication what you think it should be, but we have got no indication whatsoever. Questions in the back.\nAttendees: My name is Mr. [indiscernible].  Which countries did you actually visit? Because you said that you could assess the global situation from Veldhoven or maybe by e-mail. But most colleagues of yours say in other AGMs what countries they actually visited. You went to ZEISS in Germany, I understand. What other countries were visited?\nExecutives: Well, we don't do everything by e-mail but, of course, we can look into all the global systems. And in the past year, I went to Korea, I want to Taiwan, 2 of the main countries for ASML, very important countries for ASML. I spoke with local management, with local auditors. We also have obligations under the Articles of Association which we have to check. And it usually takes a little bit longer before we get those.  We do have a network of local auditors, but we could do most of the work ourselves. So we go to a couple of countries this year. We plan to go to China and to the United States of America.\nAttendees: André Jorna with VEB. Yes, there's been much debate about your -- well, in social interaction because you are our eyes and ears in companies. To what extent can you assure us that ASML's income statement is as it should be? Because you audited it and checked whether any money items are being shifted around? For example, earnings being transferred to a different year?  How did you do that and how did you establish that in all properties present?\nAttendees: Well, we scrutinize the revenues, so revenue recognition being taken at the correct point in time is something we monitor carefully. And as for the income state whether the assets are present and whether the company still has sufficient earnings capacity. Of course, that's the case. As for intangibles such as goodwill and activating development costs, we look at those very carefully, too. So we think that the income sheet is as it should be. And as you see in our auditor’s opinion, we believe it's a true and fair view.\nAttendees: We're happy to hear that the income statement is as it should be. That comforts us and put that in writing, too. But there's a lot in writing nowadays that doesn't always turn out to be true, especially if you zoom in. As for your management letter, was it longer or shorter than it was last time?\nAttendees: I would say it was about the same length. I think some items that we identified last year have been resolved, and we've discovered a few new ones. What matters most is that management follows up on this and takes it on board and they did.\nAttendees: As for the accuracy of financial reportings, the internal audits, including cybersecurity, do you have a good opinion about those as well?\nAttendees: Well, that was why we mentioned the U.S. statements where we shared opinions concerning the financial reporting. With cybersecurity, our main role is to determine that management considers what we reported and that they also follow up with the Supervisory Board. So we see whether they follow up in sufficient measure. Thank you.\nExecutives: If there are no additional questions, then I'll hand you back to our Secretary.\nExecutives: I'll explain the voting procedure. Those of you are entitled to cast a vote at this meeting have received voting handsets and a chip card containing the data that matter for this meeting. Please insert your smart card with the gold-colored chip facing you into your keypad. Once you've inserted the smart card properly, you'll see a welcome message on the display, then you can keep that card inside your keypad during the meeting. If the smart card is not inserted properly, you'll see a warning message on the display. At the moment the vote is open, you will see the option to vote on the display. Press 1 if you are voting in favor of the proposal, press 2 if you are voting against the proposal and press -- use 3 if you would like to abstain from the vote. The display will confirm your selection. You may change your selection, but once the vote is closed your final selection counts. If you have difficulty voting, please raise your hand and somebody will come to assist you. We'll try a dry run of voting based on a statement, and this statement is, \"I have visited the ASML Experience Center before.\" Will the voting operator please activate the system.  Mr. Stephens has a problem.\nAttendees: Unfortunately, the speaker is inaudible. Interpreter apologizes.\nExecutives: [Foreign Language] The vote has been opened for a while. Please cast your vote.\n[Voting]\nExecutives: [Foreign Language] Most of you have already voted in this trial run. So in a few moments, I'd like to close the vote. The vote is closed, and we'll await the outcome. And I see the outcome is available and a great many of you have been there by now. Well, it's certainly a nice place.\nExecutives: [Foreign Language] I'd like to continue with the vote on agenda item 4. Please take your keypad and voting handset, and we've explained the procedure. And as soon as we open the vote, please cast your votes. Please open the vote on agenda item 4b. Please cast your vote.\n[Voting]\nExecutives: [Foreign Language] I see that most of you have cast your vote. So I will close the vote. [Foreign Language] It's closed. [Foreign Language]  The result is available, and I see that the proposal has been adopted. [Foreign Language]. Okay, for some reason, the percentages didn't add up, but you did see the result of the votes cast. We're delighted to see 100%, but that's not really right now. Clarification of the company's reserves and dividend policy. This is a discussion item, not a voting item, and the company aims to pay out a dividend that will be stable and to continue to grow. And for additional explanation on the dividend policy of the company, please see pages 88 and beyond of the integrated report for 2017. Are there any questions about this topic?\nMr. Jorna?\nAttendees: Mr. Chairman, the share buyback from EUR 1.5 billion to EUR 2 billion, of course, we don't oppose that. The payout ratio stands at approximately 28%, which is a bit low if you compare that with others. And the question is that substantial increase is because of the increase in cash, you have a lot, so you can divert some to shareholders. That's fine. You've purchased at EUR 109 in the past, so that's a considerable profit, as well. Do you expect that given the share price today and 2 weeks ago, do you expect to create value for the shareholders by repurchasing the shares? Or do you think that the share price is very high now and as for your repurchasing and timing the repurchasing, do you say we don't care with the share price is, we'll simply repurchase a chunk every quarter, or do you take direction in that?\nExecutives: I'll hand you over to our CFO, Wolfgang, for that question.\nExecutives: Thanks for your question. We have -- we apply our capital returns policy pretty consistently for 8 to 10 years now. We do foresee a split between dividends and share buybacks. The reason for that is it gives us flexibility. As you know, dividends, although we increase them all the time, is something that we do not want to take away. Even in the financial crisis in 2008 and '09, we didn't take away the dividends. But we are very focused on giving money that we don't need to run the business back to shareholders. We keep sufficient cash reserves and financial flexibility also from a debt capacity, et cetera, to put investments back in the business in the form of R&D and M&A. And we're in constant contact with our shareholders on what type of returns the shareholders prefer. And as you can imagine, you ask 100 shareholders, you get different opinions. But the vast majority is agreeing with us that we keep the dividend at a manageable level, keep the flexibility by using share buybacks, and you have seen that at work in 2016, 2017. We were well advised to have a relatively lower dividend because we could cut down the share buyback program when we were buying HMI and making a major equity investment in Carl Zeiss. As it relates to the volume of the share buybacks, you could see we had a EUR 1.5 billion program for 2016/'17 that we did not exhaust. We only used EUR 900 million because of the 2 reasons I just mentioned, and we have just announced a EUR 2.5 billion program for 2018/2019. As it relates to the share price, we are not predicting the share price. We believe it's a very appropriate form of giving back money now to the shareholder and increasing the portion of the future profits to the remaining shareholders. So we have no set target price where we would start -- stop the share buyback program.\nExecutives: Thank you, Wolfgang.\nAttendees: Mr. Nickl, do you, therefore, believe that at this -- with this course of action you're creating value. Is the value of the company lower than the share price suggests so? Are you creating value or are you saying that's not an issue at all?\nExecutives: That a company creates value by either doing dividends or buying back shares, that's just 2 different forms of returning cash to the shareholders. The company creates value by creating an attractive product portfolio that creates a value for our customers and that increases our future cash flows. I think you can also look at the theory. There are endless debates about the mix of these 2 instruments, but I firmly believe that you don't create value by the choice of the forms how you give money back to shareholders.\nExecutives: And he is implicitly saying that -- and also when you've carefully listened to what we've said on the future of this industry and the position of ASML, that it is about value creation and about growth. So in that context, I think, we have given you an indirect answer to your question.\nAttendees: Yes, I heard that, and I understand it. But what I'm actually aiming at is whether you think that ASML is worth more than the current share price?\nExecutives: Well, that's not truly our call. That's up to the market and you, as investors. And we are good at building sophisticated machines and selling them to our customers. We aim to create as much value as possible to maximize the bottom line and generate a lot of cash so that, in addition to our minimum cash, we can distribute money to shareholders. I think that's a very -- that's an excellent policy. The market is generally saying bye. [ Mr. Spanier ]?\nAttendees: I'm [ Mr. Spanier ], I have a question. Unfortunately, Mr. Nickl will be leaving us. So a buyback campaign is in progress. The new CFO that remains to be appointed, I hope for her sake that she makes the grade. What instructions will she or he receive? Will that person be expected to carry out the same share buyback arrangement that Mr. Nickl devised? What will the instructions be?\nExecutives: I think it's very simple. I certainly hope so. Yes, it is. Okay, for the time being, the answer is yes. Financial policy, overall, has been devised by the CFO. Of course, as discussed and approved within the board and management, and we agree entirely, there is no change in financial policy. So as I was just saying, all cash above the minimum we need will be returned to shareholders as dividend and that is it a growing, but in any case, stable dividend, and the rest is -- consist of share buyback. And I have no reason to assume that the new CFO, whom I know very well, is likely to change that.\nAttendees: That was my question because you devised a certain vision together with Mr. Nickl and the supervisory board but now you'll have a new dude in that position. Are you -- the person -- are you going to tell the new financial dude how we do it? Or will you hand that over to Mr. Kleisterlee?\nExecutives: No, I prefer to leave that to the new CFO to develop that with us, but I know the new CFO, and I'm fully confident that it will be done with good common sense and policy, so I see no reason why we should adapt to our present dividend with the policy on returning money. All I can tell you is my estimate is that any changes on our part will be extremely minimal.\nAnd I'll wrap up this agenda item and move on to adopting a dividend of 1 year of EUR 0.40 per ordinary share. Because this topic has already been discussed in agenda item 2 and 4C, I'll refer to the previous debate and will now give you the opportunity to ask any additional questions should you feel such a need. If not, then I propose that we vote on the dividend proposal. The voting operator has to activate the system. Please cast your vote.\n[Voting]\nExecutives: I see that most of you have voted. I'd like to close the system in a few moments. The vote is closed and we will await the results.\nI see that the results are available and that a majority of the votes has been cast in favor of the proposal. So we note that this proposal has been adopted as well.\nOnto agenda item 5A. The proposal to discharge the members of the board of management from liability for carrying out their responsibilities in the financial year 2017. Would anybody like the floor on this? If not, we will open the vote on this proposal, as well. Mr. Secretary, with the operator, please activate the voting system. The vote is open.\n[Voting]\nExecutives: I see that most of you have cast your vote. We're about to close the vote. The vote is closed.\nI see the results of the vote are available. Over to the Chairman. Now I have some percentages, at least partial at some places, so we note that this proposal has been adopted.\nNext, approval of the number of shares to be allocated to the board of management -- wait a minute, 5B, the proposal to discharge the members of the supervisory board from liability. Nobody would like the floor. We'll activate the system. Open the vote with the voting -- operator, please activate the system. Please cast your vote.\n[Voting]\nExecutives: I see that most of you have already voted, so we'll be closing the vote in a few moments. The vote is closed.\nI see the results are available and a majority of the votes has been cast in favor of the proposal. Okay. So that's been adopted. Wonderful, we have the approval to -- we have the approval. Now the proposal to approve the number of shares for the board of management. The ultimate allocation of shares will be done by the supervisory board based on the applicable remuneration policy by applying the calculation method as described in such policy. Furthermore, in this agenda item, it is proposed to the general meeting to designate the board of management as the body authorized to issue the aforementioned shares subject to the approval of the supervisory board. This designation is requested for the period from this meeting until the Annual General Meeting to be held in 2019. ASML has previously agreed to inform the general meeting each year about the exact number of shares granted conditionally on 19 January 2018, 43,500 -- excuse me, 43,650 shares have been granted conditionally to the current board of management, excluding the new members for the financial year 2018. The volume weighted average share price during the last quarter of the financial year 2017 equaled EUR 149.82. In connection with his intended appointment, Mr. Dassen has been granted a conditional board in 2019 for 10,000 performance-related shares. This grant is subject to the performance conditions and the 3-year vesting period. As applicable under the remuneration policy, the maximum number of shares can be -- can be obtained are up to 20,000 performance-related shares and in 2019, the general meeting will also be informed about the number of shares granted conditionally to the board of management for the financial year 2019. Now, I'd like to open the floor to questions. Mr. Jorna?\nAttendees: Mr. Chairman, I'm Jorna from the VEB. Mr. Chairman, granting what I describe as a sign-on bonus for Mr. Dassen, we, as the -- from the VEB, object to this on principle. He has not done anything to earn this. It's probably compensation for what he would have received at Deloitte as a long-term incentive, and we don't see any reason to compensate him for the long-term incentive at Deloitte because it tends to be conditional and you don't know whether he'd achieve it. And second, you're giving a staff member a bonus to keep them over the long term within the company. If all of us agree to take over that bonus, then we'd be done and dusted, but I don't think that's the right way to deal with a long-term incentive. That's why we object on principle to a sign-on bonus.\nExecutives: We know that, and we understand that. But the situation is a bit more subtle than that, perhaps Rolf-Dieter Schwalb could explain why in this case the entire supervisory board supports the Remuneration Committees' conclusion that this is a good way forward.\nExecutives: I'll try to explain that. Mr. Dassen, in his capacity as an employee of Deloitte, received only fixed income. So no variable part. That fixed income was significantly higher than what we can offer to him. And to basically compensate him at risk because our system has a risk, as you know, STI, LTI, and it will follow the same LTI, the 10,000 shares, 20,000 maximum will follow the same LTI rules as all the other LTIs. So it can be 0, it can be 20,000, it can be anything in between. So there's a risk element to it. So forgetting the risk, the 10,000 at target achievement on the LTI performance criteria would basically, for 3 years, roughly be equivalent to the delta of the total direct compensation at ASML versus the fixed compensation he received at Deloitte. That was what he felt totally reasonable and it follows performance criteria. There's no sign-on bonus guaranteed, nothing. And it basically only smoothens it for 3 years. So he has to show, of course, with his own work and performance that after that period, he either has to live with a lower salary, that's then bad luck, or achieve a higher salary because of results.\nExecutives: Thank you, Rolf-Dieter. Thank you. That's highly appreciated. [ Mr. Spanier ]?\nAnalysts: I'm [ Mr. Spanier ], I have a question. We're talking about the number of shares. Are you going to reissue the shares that you've repurchased in the previous buyback? You're not going to run the process again. And I basically object to St. Nicholas and Christmas gifts where you simply stand and wait for them. Why don't you let the person concerned work for 1 year first and then ask shareholders after 1 year -- he's been working for 1 year. Can you please have this EUR 10,000 or 10,000 shares or whatever, rather than before giving him the Santa Claus or Christmas present to unwrap before he even comes on board.\nExecutives: Well, I could go along with part of this but then say, okay, well, he will only be able to unwrap his gift after a few years of good performance. Yes, I hear you. And I think Mr. Schwalb has tried to explain this is not a Santa Claus or a Christmas gift, and that these performance shares have a 3-year vesting period. And that means performing for 3 years after which there will or will not be a payment, except for the nominal shares. It's not 1 year, it's about 3 years, and it has to be an empty kitty, too. May I now open the vote on this proposal? Would the operator please activate the system? I see the system is active and you may now cast your vote.\n[Voting]\nExecutives: I see that the majority of you have cast your vote and in a few seconds, I'm going to close the vote. The vote is closed.\nAnd I see that the result is available and the majority has voted in favor of the proposal, so we note that this proposal has been adopted as well.\nThat takes us to agenda item 7, composition of the board of management. On 12 September 2017, we announced that Wolfgang Nickl had decided, as of today's shareholders meeting, to leave at HSML -- excuse me, ASML. First, Mr. Wolfgang, we did this with the entire supervisory board yesterday evening and the board of management, you must have done this countless times within ASML. Once again, in the presence of our shareholders, we're pleased to thank you for your exceptionally valuable contribution to the growth and development of ASML. You had -- were a magnificent CFO and the Rock of Gibraltar on the management team. Thank you. And in your new role as Bayer's CFO, we wish you all the very best. It's a small world. I'm sure we'll see each other again in the future. We wish all the very best. At this agenda item, the supervisory board informs the board of management of envisaged reappointment of Peter Wennink, Martin van den Brink, Frederic Schneider-Maunoury and -- as members of the ASML board of management. The reasons for reappointing Mr. Wennink, van den Brink and Schneider-Maunoury are explained in the agenda and do not require extensive elaboration. The reappointments of Wennink, van den Brink and Schneider-Maunoury will be for a 4-year term commencing as of today. In addition, the supervisory board informs the general meeting of the envisaged appointment of Mr. Christophe Fouquet and Mr. Roger Dassen as members of the board of management at ASML. And please see the reasons for the appointment of Mr. Fouquet and Dassen in the explanatory notes. Mr. Fouquet's appointment will commence per today. Mr. Dassen's term will commence per 1 June of this year. The personal details of Mr. Wennink, Mr. van den Brink and Mr. Schneider-Maunoury, Mr. Fouquet, and Mr. Dassen as well as the main elements of their respective contracts, including the remuneration package, are included in the explanatory notes to the agenda for this AGM. For the record, this is a discussion item, not a voting item. The appointment is done by the supervisory board pursuant to [indiscernible] and the company's Articles of Association. As stated, Mr. Fouquet and Mr. Dassen are present here today. Christophe Fouquet, please present yourself. And Roger, please introduce yourself, as well. Are there any questions about the above? We -- if -- Mr. Jorn, if you would bear with us for a moment.\nAttendees: I'm [ Herman Kipp ]. I'm speaking on behalf of the Foundation for Railway Pension Fund and Public Transport Pension Fund. We support the board of management comprising qualified individuals reflecting diversity, including gender. Unfortunately, the envisaged board of management is not diverse in this respect. We understand that this might be difficult because of the advanced technical expertise desired, but we wonder how ASML expects to safeguard additional gender diversity in the future board of management.\nExecutives: First, we agree with you. In searching for a new CFO, and we were involved in looking for a fellow board member, we had a long list comprising 12 candidates, including 4 ladies. In our interviews with the ladies, at first, 3 stated that they thought the company was too technical. And in our interview with one of the ladies before we were able to reach a conclusion, she withdrew from the procedure for the same reason at her own initiative. So the candidates -- among the other candidates remaining, Dassen was selected. We do aim for that 1/3, but this is a highly technological company and you need to feel at ease and it's not always easy to find people. They have to be available, and they have to be at ease with the company. And the market is also restricted to Europe. We could bring people from the U.S., but we can't afford them, so that's another restriction. And apart from that, the influx in the technological positions, we do want to try that and get more female employees. We get -- we have quite a few foreign female employees but Dutch female employees lack the line. Yes, that is a good addition. In R&D, especially, some 30% -- almost 35% is female, but most of those females are from abroad, from outside the Netherlands. Mr. Jorna, your turn.\nAttendees: Thank you. Jorna, VEB. Yes, Chair, did Mr. Wennink actually say that foreign CFO cannot be -- we cannot afford this?\nExecutives: No, no, no, not foreign, American, was said. American.\nAttendees: So you agree with [ Mr. von Davier ] of [ ING ]?\nExecutives: No, no, no, sir. You make a conclusion from a neutral. Mr. Wennink, I'm sure, meant to say that we do not want to have that type of -- we don't have that type of situation here.\nAttendees: Okay, I'm happy with that. So that's fine.\nExecutives: Two, accountants, CFO, CEO. They are not economists.\nAttendees: Fair enough. That's good, because they always agree.\nExecutives: So 2 accountants. Maybe that is good. And an accountant can transform into a General Manager, as Mr. Wennink has shown us. So Mr. Dassen, for his whole career has worked in accountancy.\nAttendees: So you went from the long list to the short list. Did you actually do a kind of assessment in respect of how an accountant can manage the managerial qualities because an accountant is always right after the fact, but the manager has to also know things beforehand. It requires a different attitude. We do not know in how far this person will be able to manage. The due diligence of Mr. Dassen, how was this done? Who was it done with? We understand that Mr. Wennink knows him quite well. So you know what to expect from this person but was there any further due diligence before Mr. Dassen was introduced? Final question, and really, I need to say this but do not take this personally. In the claims -- there have been many claims against auditors/accountants. Did you make sure that Mr. Dassen does not -- was not involved in any conflicting situations at Deloitte?\nExecutives: There was a very careful process. First of all, the committee and the full supervisory board, we looked at the profile, what kind of person do we want. Because the CFO must not just make sure that the numbers are crunched properly, but that he also can connect various parts of the company, the various people of the boards. Wolfgang did this very well, did this authentically and we wanted to keep that for the new CFO. So we had a profile drafted. We also had -- we had the long list, we went to the short list. And the whole management team, which is the whole board of management, and the Nomination Committee, we all interviewed 3 candidates. We did 4, you did 3, I think. We interviewed these people. Based on the interviews, we saw the differences in the qualities of the people, in their personalities. We looked at what could be the advantages, what could be the disadvantages, what were their strengths for ASML, what were their weaknesses for ASML. And after a very long procedure, with due care, all of us unanimously, both boards, support the appointment of Roger Dassen. And we worked with a third firm, a headhunter that did a lot of work, preliminary work, an independent from that headhunter, who did recommendations, who did assessments, we, ourselves, for a couple of people, who in the past worked with Roger Dassen in various positions, we got information from them directly and they made us even more enthusiastic to appoint Roger for this position.\nExecutives: And I would like to add that in the past few years, he was the Vice Chairman of a worldwide organization and that was not just being an accountant, that was managerial. So that was -- that different type of work, but also you have to look forward in that and not backward.\nExecutives: So I hope that your questions have been answered by what we just said.\nAttendees: No, there's one question still outstanding. \nWho was responsible for some international parts of Deloitte? As a person, how was -- was he actually involved in any untoward business or anything that wasn't quite kosher?\nExecutives: Well, we know nothing of this. In as far as we were able to check this, nothing was found that pointed in this direction. So I hereby note that, on behalf of the Supervisory Board, Mrs. -- that Mr. Fouquet was formally appointed effective April 25, 2018, and Mr. Dassen, effective 1 June 2018. And also, Wennink, Van den Brink and Schneider-Maunoury have been appointed. So congratulations, everyone, on their reappointment and on their appointment, which brings us to the composition of the Supervisory Board, and we have 2 voting items and one discussion item.\nThe voting items concern the proposals to appoint and reappoint certain members of the Supervisory Board. And as we announced last year, Ms. Van der Meer Morh and Mr. Stork will retire their rotation per this meeting. And Mr. Van der Meer Morh has indicated that she does not wish to be reappointed and she will resign as a Supervisory Board member. And Pauline, dear Pauline, thank you so much. Yes, she is over there, all the way there. Thank you to you, too, for what you've done in the past 9 years. You were so involved, your engagement in the Supervisory Board, but you were also a member of the Selection and Nomination Committee, and you had a very important role in that, and you were also a part of the Audit Committee. So thank you so much for what you did for us. And we will miss you as a person and we will miss your contribution to this Supervisory Board.\nMr. Stork indicated that he is available for reappointment, and the Supervisory Board has decided to nominate him for reappointment.\nAnd furthermore, the Supervisory Board wishes to nominate Ms. Terri Kelly as a member of the Supervisory Board. And Ms. Kelly is also here today, and the explanatory notes to the agenda contain the motivations for these nominations and the personal details of the candidates. The appointment of Ms. Kelly and reappointment of Mr. Stork will be effective this meeting and will both be for a 4-year period. The shareholders did not use their right of recommendation with respect to these vacancies.\nThe Works Council did not recommend any candidate for the vacancy, following Mr. Stork retirement per rotation. The Works Council has decided to use its enhanced recommendation right for the nomination of Ms. Kelly. And the Works Council was given timely -- was given time to give its opinion on the opportunity on the appointment and of the reappointment of these 2 people. So Ms. Kelly, please, would you stand up, please. Show yourself to the meeting.\nAnd again, I give the meeting -- the opportunity to put questions, if you wish to make use of this opportunity. Yes, Mr. Davis just raised his hand. He would like to ask a question.\nAttendees: Thank you, Chairman. My name is [ Stevens ]. What about Ms. Kelly's own motivation? We'd like to hear from her, why she wants to join the board.\nExecutives: So my history has been working for a highly technical company for the past -- last 35 years. My background is actually in mechanical engineering. I have been the CEO of that company for the past 13 years, and now stepping down. But don't want to retire, and so I'm very excited about what is happening at ASML and the technology. And also, I am very committed to the workforce and creating the right environment. And so I think it's a perfect match of where ASML is in the growth projections ahead and just where I think I can contribute. Thank you.\nExecutives: Thank you very much. With that, we are going to move to the appointment of Hans Stork.\nAttendees: [Foreign Language] Yes, the secretary will reopen the vote. And the secretary, Mr. Kleipool, says that the voting is now open, and Mr. Kleisterlee explains again that it is the proposal to report Mr. Stork as a member of the Supervisory Board for 4 years, that is being voted on at the moment.\nExecutives: I note that most of you have, indeed, voted, so let's deactivate the voting system and you can no longer cast your votes.\nExecutives: We note that Hans has been reappointed. Congratulations. The appointment of Ms. Kelly as a member of the Supervisory Board also for 4 years. And the operator is asked to activate the voting system. It is now open. You may cast your votes.\n[Voting]\nExecutives: Most of you have voted. So we will close the vote. We have actually now closed the vote and the result is available.\nAttendees: [Foreign Language] The chair says that we see that the proposal has been adopted. Congratulations to the new member, Ms. Kelly.\nExecutives: The Supervisory Board advises you that by 2019, there will be various vacancies on the Supervisory Board. In 2019, myself, Kleisterlee. Ms. Aris, Mr. Schwalb and Mr. Ziebart, they will all retire by rotation, and all members are, in principle, available for reappointment. The general meeting, the AGM and Works Council have the right to recommend other candidates for these vacancies. The Works Council has an enhanced recommendation right for the vacancy that will result from the retirement of Ms. Aris. And I give you now the opportunity to put questions. Mr. [ Stevens ] has just raised his hand.\nAttendees: Thank you, Chair. My name is [ Stevens ], and my organization is very much for continuity in a company. And next year, 50% of the members will retire by rotation. They are available for reappointment, you say, but things may change between now and then. What if all 4 persons say, \"No, we don't want to be reappointed. We are not available\", which would be difficult.\nExecutives: Well yes, we said we are, in principle, available for reappointment.\nAttendees: Well yes, a lot can happen in 4 years' time. So maybe you will not have 4 people available for reappointment.\nExecutives: Well, you can't change. All 4 people joined on a certain date, but we'll bear this in mind, of course, because we are going to try and do this in a more staggered way in the future. So we will continue to look for enhancement of the Supervisory Board with a more staggered situation so that we don't have the same situation that 4 people retire by rotation. So they have 4 years, first, and then 2 years for reappointment. We'll try and, as I say, stagger this a bit more, but this was created apparently at the time when we needed new blood in the Supervisory Board. There's nothing we can do about that right now at this moment.\nOkay, this was a discussion item, not a voting item. So let's continue with the next item on the agenda, which is the proposal to appoint KPMG as the external auditor for 2019. As you will have read in the explanatory notes to the agenda, KPMG accountant has done the audit for 2017, and we have had an assessment of the job done and the quality, scope and planning of the audit was assessed. Pursuant to the outcome of this survey, we propose to again put KPMG as the external auditor. And therefore, the Supervisory Board, per the recommendation of the Audit Committee proposes to appoint KPMG as the company's external auditor. Would you like to ask any questions? Specific questions will be answered by Ms. [ Smiths Lusterling ] because she is the Chair of the committee. No questions? Let's vote.\nAttendees: [Foreign Language] Secretary asks the operator to activate the voting system, which is, indeed, now open.\n[Voting]\nExecutives: I can see that most of you have voted, so in a few seconds, we'll close the system, which is actually being done now. And the result is available, so I give the floor to the chair.\nExecutives: This item was adopted, and we continue with Item 10 on the agenda, which comprises Items A, B, C and D, and we will vote on each of these items. It is an annually recurring item on the agenda, but an important one. And it is in the company's interest, and that of you, the shareholders, to be able to react quickly if particular circumstances arise for which an issue of shares is required. Therefore, the Board of Management would like to be able to issue shares when such circumstances, indeed, arise and exclude the preemption right where it is necessary to act quickly. And as an example, in [ 2020 ], we use this authorization for the acquisition of Cymer, and in 2016, for the acquisition of Hermes Microvision. It was also used for the issue of convertible bonds in the past. And the authorizations to be granted will be valid for 18 months, from today until 25 October 2019. If you do adopt the proposals of this agenda item, the existing authorizations will expire. 10A is the authorization of the Board of Management to issue ordinary shares or to grant rights to subscribe for ordinary shares in the company's share capital, for general purposes, limited to 5% of the issued share capital at the time of authorization and, of course, subject to Supervisory Board's approval. Item 10B is the authorization of the board of management to restrict or even exclude the preemption rights that are accrued to shareholders in connection with 10A of the Agenda. And this is also subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board.\nAfter this, we'll continue with 10C, which is the authorization of the Board of Management as the body to issue shares or grant rights to subscribe for shares for an additional 5% of the current share capital of the company, also subject to Supervisory Board approval. And this additional 5% can only be used on the occasion of mergers, acquisitions and/or strategic alliances. And then finally, we have Item 10D. Again, this is an authorization for the Board of Management and, in this case, it is to restrict or exclude the preemption rights accruent to shareholders in connection with the issue of shares or rights to subscribe for shares, as described on 10C. And as with the other items, this is subject to Supervisory Board approval. Nobody wishes to take the floor, so let's start voting 10A. You may now cast your votes.\n[Voting]\nExecutives: As the majority of votes have been cast, the system will soon close. Yes, you can no longer cast your votes, and we see that a majority has voted in favor. So we can continue with 10-B. And again, the operator activates the system. Please cast your votes. \n[Voting]\nExecutives: As most of you have voted, we will close the vote in a few seconds. Yes, we've got the results. We can see that this item was also adopted. 10-C is now to be voted on and the same procedure applies.\n[Voting]\nExecutives: Yes. We close the vote as the majority of votes have been already cast. You can no longer vote. The result is available. And the majority -- a majority of votes was cast in favor. Final item of the 10 is D. Please vote on D.\n[Voting]\nExecutives: We will soon see the result on the screen after the vote has been closed. And a majority of votes was cast in favor, so this proposal has also been adopted. Agenda Items 11 and 12, the authorization to acquire and cancel ordinary shares, and this is because of the flexibility for the return of capital to the shareholders. Such flexibility requires a mandate for further share buybacks and to adopt further cancellation of shares should the company decide to do so. And as you will understand, this depends on various factors, and you are advised that there is no certainty as to further return of capital or as to the timing of another potential distribution, nor as how to achieve such distribution, and this was already addressed on the Agenda Item 2. I will deal with these 2 items, 11 and 12, separately.\n11 is the proposal to authorize the board of management to acquire ordinary shares, a max of 10%, that is, and subject to Supervisory Board approval. We have listed their conditions in the explanatory notes, and that was Agenda 11. Agenda Item 11A and 11B is for a further maximum 10% with additional conditions as set out in the explanatory notes to the agenda. And the reason why we ask this additional authorization is for further flexibility in the execution of a distribution of capital to you, the shareholders. And these authorizations are requested for 18 months, from today until 25 October 2019. If you do adopt these 2 proposals, the existing authorizations will expire. And I see that nobody has a question, so let's vote on 11A, which is the authorization to repurchase up to 10% max of the issued share capital. Voting is now open.\n[Voting]\nExecutives: [Foreign Language] We are ready to show the result on the screen, and it was adopted. This item next, 11B, that is the additional repurchasing of -- or repurchasing of an additional 10% of the issued share capital. We will now vote on this.\n[Voting]\nExecutives: You can no longer cast your votes, and the result is available.\nExecutives: We see that this was adopted. Agenda Item 12 is a proposal to cancel ordinary shares, and that may be done in one or more parcels or blocks. And the number of shares to be canceled will be determined by the Board of Management, but will never exceed 20% of the issued share capital as today. No questions? Please vote on Item 12 on the agenda.\n[Voting]\nExecutives: [Foreign Language] The vote is closed now and the results are available.\nExecutives: This was adopted, agenda Item 12, which brings us to any other business. Does anyone have any questions that you wish to put? And Mr. [indiscernible] just raised his hand.\nAttendees: Mr. Chair, my name is [indiscernible]. I have a question. 5G, 5G for the telecommunications industry. Do you see that other companies want more machines because 5G, the drones will be able to communicate, and they cannot do that with the use of 4G. So maybe you already have a higher demand? Whether you can deliver machines at a certain time that are kind of 5G-compliant or something.\nExecutives: Well, quick answer. It is an improvement of the 4G technology and there is a very limited number of applications for 5G at this stage, and there's hardly a business case. There will be one, but it will take a while, but it will be of no significance to ASML.\nAttendees: Chair. My name is [indiscernible]. I have a question -- well, actually, a remark. Big Data, this afternoon, it was mentioned, there's a -- it's important in today's world. Major companies, Apple, Facebook deal with Big Data. Some 80% to 70% of all Big Data is in their hands. Big Data multiply and distort one another. It plays a big role in the holistic chain. Continuously, deviations are being monitors -- monitored to correct the precision of this. In this chain, a lot of data are stored on lots of things. My question is, what about how do you control these Big Data within the company? I have another example. You have a lot of suppliers, some-100 suppliers, more than 100 suppliers. Some also are involved in research for the next generation, a lot of data. And these are not the data that we used to have, the drawings and the plans that you can file. So tell me a little bit more about this. Do you have a designated department or will you set up a designated department for Big Data? It is an issue in the world. And Oxford and Cambridge are specialized, and they warn us about this topic.\nExecutives: Okay. Big Data, there's a lot of talk about Big Data. And of course, that's a hot topic that encompasses quite a few ideas. You're addressing very -- 2 very specific aspects in ASML where we deal with the data transactions, gathering and using it in our machines. I think you could say something about that [ Martin], but the very simple answer is it's completely screened from any external disclosure. Is it one department that deals with everything overall? No, it's single policy. Until recently, dealing with these large data files was very specific, but at our initiative, its turn -- been merged into one department that handles the Big Data Lake in a standardized manner. Now a few comments about the machine. We have extensive access to the machine production data. Theoretically, we even have access to the chip design, so that we can optimize the chip. Now as for how we deal with the sensitive data, the main issue is that with the customers -- and there's a company that is still manufacturing chips for others and wants to keep all the technology internal. We design the tools to optimize this, but the data remains in the factory. And to the extent that data is necessary to run our machines, we have very specific agreements on data access, and they certainly don't consider chip layout or the wafers where it's manufactured.\nAttendees: So might it be a good idea to address this in a subsequent annual report so Big Data and how you deal with it? Or did I not read the report in detail and is it already there?\nExecutives: I don't believe that you didn't read enough our Annual Report. Yes, that's part of our entire strategic decision-making process. You're entirely right. The party that holds the data, holds the value, and that's the truth, but our data is far from straightforward. And in the years ahead, we'll certainly have to explore that with the large platform. They always call them the Googles and the Amazons in this world. I'm sure that quite a bit of water will run will under the bridge before it's clear exactly how that needs to be dealt with and it's also a social issue. What about our service engineers, the application engineers that work together with customers? They often have no access to data from outside the factory. They have to be in the data room itself to help optimize.\nAttendees: [The operator says the question was inaudible and  the answer is \"Absolutely, thank you.\"]\nShareholders: Thank you. Good afternoon, I'm Mr. [indiscernible], I've been a shareholder since 2001. I am very, very happy. First, like last year, I'd like to thank Mrs. van de Kerkhof again. And it seems to be increasingly difficult to attend this meeting, but Mrs. van de Kerkhof arranged it once again. Do I understand that Intel holds only 3% of the share and Samsung is out of the picture?\nExecutives: No, not Samsung. They still have some shares.\nShareholders: And we've had this debate in the past, too. I didn't understand entirely at that time, perhaps Mr. Wennink could explain to me once again why he is opposed to a stock dividend. That was my impression.\nExecutives: Well, yes. I've -- I get that question a lot. The stock dividend and the share premium is -- could be a very attractive option for private investors in The Netherlands. But institutionally, it doesn't really matter, because it's mainly the pension funds that want the cash dividend and if you would issue it in shares, then they have to sell it, and that cause many efforts. So it's more convenient for them to receive it in cash. 96% of our shareholders are institutional investors, so it's quite a hassle and they don't really want to deal with the hassle. Yes, but then [ Phillips ] does it by default, and Shell started doing it again in the past 2 years, and it certainly adds up. But these are shares that have been traditionally very popular among retail investors, and that's not the case in our company. So it's not attractive to you, and there's only 4% there anyway or even less. \n[Foreign Language] If there are no other questions, I'd like to thank you for coming and for your interest and for your questions. And I'm closing this meeting and invite you for snacks and beverages in the lobby outside. Thank you."

         "ASML Holding N.V. Presents at 46th Annual J.P. Morgan Global Technology, Media and Communications Conference, May-16-2018 10:00 AM",
         "Analysts: Okay, good morning, everyone. My name is Bill Peterson, I work on the U.S. semiconductor and semiconductor equipment research team. We have it here today is Peter Wennink, the CEO of ASML, doing a fireside chat, on behalf of my colleague, Sandeep, who is based in London. \nPete is going to give some opening comments about ASML and then we'll move to Q&A and then I'll open up later on. But it's certainly a pleasure to have you here, Peter. Thanks a lot for coming.\nExecutives: Okay, thanks. I think perhaps good to basically give you a couple of minutes of comments as a result of the day and a half that we've been spending here in Boston and talking about our business, our industry. And I'd like to start off with one of -- there's a lot of questions that we've got on over the last one and a half day, it was about the cycle. And that's quite interesting because some people said, well do we still have a cycle? And I think the following is basically where we are. And I think the industry has significantly consolidated over the last 10 years. So we will always have in this industry, pockets in time where -- when you look at our business and our customer base, logic, DRAM and NAND, within those segments, there are only a few players left. And when those players all decide to basically put a capacity of those would be mega fabs, it often cost more than $10 billion each, you will have a step up in capacity.  So that is unavoidable. I don't think it's very bad. If you look for instance in 3D NAND, the CAGR there is 45%. So yes, if you put up as an extra capacity in a step up function, it will grow into it, quite rapidly also. \nNow when we talk about the industry, I think the most important thing that we need to remind ourselves obviously is that this industry is very much driven by what happens in logic. Why? Because the logic fuels the compute power that is needed in all those areas that we're currently so excited about, whether it's artificial intelligence, Big Data, it's the cloud or it's self-driving cars, it's crypto mining, it doesn't matter. I mean it's all about high-power compute. And high-power compute is driven by the ability of our customers to keep shrinking, and effectively saying, the roadmap of that particular shrink, which is now at 10-nanometer, again our customers effectively bring that down to 7, 5, 3, 2, 1.5, which will bring us beyond 2030. \nI think the answer to that is yes. I think we can do that. And that means that given the wide array of applications that we're currently seeing, that can be actually used the compute power, which is so much more applications in space, so much more wider than 5 or 10 years ago, that -- the industry is that once they get to a 7-nanometer node, the speed with which they will ramp up a certain level of capacity is also higher. That's what we're seeing today. And that's actually fueled our business over the next -- over the last 3 years and for the next couple of years. The ramp up speed of the new technology is very high. And has been very high and logic has been our most prominent part of our business for the last 3 years. And I think it will be for the next couple of years. \nNow let me start with logic, we have high-power compute capability, there's this siamese twin that is tied to logic, which is called high-performance memory which is DRAM. So when you have a relatively fast growing ramp up of new technology and the roadmap can be executed because of EUV, then we also need high-performance bits. And the last 2 years and also this year, we estimate a 25% bit growth in DRAM this year. \nNow something has happened in the DRAM space over the last couple of years and going forward and that's -- there is the one area, the one segment of the industry where Moore's law is slowing down. You see the innovations are going from a node to node time of 2 years to 4 years, which effectively means that every year, we won't be able to add like we did in the past because of technology transitions, 15% to 20% bits just because of technology transitions. It's more like 10% to 15%. Now if your DRAM demand, which is very tightly tied to the rollout of your logic roadmap, if that requires 25% bit growth, you can only get 10%, 15% max, fully close to 10% through the technology transitions. And how do you get that extra -- those extra bits? By wafers. You have to put extra wafers. \nNow this is actually -- that didn't happen over the last 2 years, which is the reason why impression didn't show up. It's very simple. Supply and demand equation. Now DRAM wafer capacity installed base actually didn't grow as a matter of fact, it went down because over the last couple of years, some of those DRAM tools went to do the 3D NAND space. Now how were our customers able then to still deliver 25%, albeit that the prices went up? It's because the productivity in those fabs went up quite significantly. When we look at the wafer per day records that we saw 2 years ago on our tools, it was about 4,500 wafers, we are now closing up [ 6,000 ] wafers per day. \nSo cranking out more wafers has been the solution. Now that means in some DRAM fabs, you have 97% availability constantly. Now you cannot be at 100% because you need some overhead. So what is the availability of our customers to keep getting more wafers out? That is limited. So we need to build fabs. \nAnd this is what is actually happening I mean one of our customers is has emptied a particular fab where that production went to a 3D NAND new development and that open space is now being filled with DRAM tools and luckily so. \nNow we look going forward, and we see this development of logic, 7-nanometer, 5-nanometer, 3-nanometer , in an application space that is growing, that means that the ramp up speed of the new technology will be high, we need high performance DRAM. So in our mind, there is actually a need for more DRAM wafers. We don't see this as kind of a build up bubble coming. \nSo that's just DRAM. On 3D NAND, which is storage, now clearly 45% CAGR is very nice and it's good. But you see more players in this space. Where we have 3 major players in DRAM. We have 6 in 3D NAND and over timeframe of 2, 2.5 years, we see all these 6 players putting new capacity in place. That's not all at the same time, there's also not a very homogeneous group of customers. You have start up customers in China and you have very mature customers in Korea. And they are all -- but they are all planning for capacity expansion. That will happen over a relatively long period 2, 2.5 years.  So you will see from time to time these pockets of extra capacity coming up, which will probably drive the price weakness, it's pretty price elastic market.  But that's normal, and with the CAGR of 45%, I think they will grow into that pockets of extra capacity relatively quick. \nSo all in all, long introduction for that, sorry for that Bill. I know you have a lot of questions so won't be a lot of time left. But this is where we are. And it's not only where we are today, I think this is where the industry will be for the next couple of years. And again, critical here is will the industry -- and we're partner in that industry, will the industry be able to keep following the road map and actually that queue that roadmap in a cost effective manner, and we believe that we will be able to do so.\nAnalysts: Great, thanks for that. And we have some questions on the end market and you kind of addressed a lot of that. but I guess maybe just specific to memory, I think you said in the past that you have a pretty good feel for DRAM capacity. So at least it sounds like you don't see the imminent over signs of supply. NAND you've kind of commented you have less visibility but I think you do have a visibility to whether or not they are either going to be stacked or not. So I know orders has been strong in NAND. But I guess sort of a two-part question, first on NAND, how do you see the requirements for litho for next generation 3D NAND evolving? And then really for DRAM obviously, spending has been high this year. How do you see that sort of trending over say the next 6 to 12 months?\nExecutives: Yes. I think like I said early, 3 segments, logic DRAM and NAND, I think only in DRAM we see a slowing of Moore's law, we don't see it in logic and we don't see it in NAND. The bit density increase is basically managed through stacking more layers. Basically creating more layers on top of each other. We have ultimately we've seen our roadmaps where customers are looking at 92 layers for 3D NAND. Now but out of the 92 layers, you don't build them on top of each other, it's very clear that our customers are now talking about creating a stack of let's say 64 layers and then creating an intermediate layer and then putting all the stack of 64 on top, creating an intermediate layer, putting all those stack of 64 on top, so we've made stacks of stacks. But that connection between those stacks is highly little intensive. So it's good for us because it actually means that although as compared to 2D NAND, if you have a greenfield 3D NAND fab, you need 10% more litho. The way we put stacks on stacks, you need another 15% to 20% extra litho per stack. So that is good for us and I think we'll just see that but it's not only the fact that were stacking stacks but it's also that specific requirements on lithography tools is different in 3D NAND because you have opaque layers, which are very difficult to align layer, 2 layers, so we have specific solutions that we're creating rating in our dry deep UV tools, also creating value for our customers. And all is developing in an area where we are increasingly providing more value to our NAND customers. Going forward, like I said, there are 6 NAND customers for the next 2, 2.5 years that will are either in the process of or have just finished or are preparing to build new capacity. And that of course will be a big driver, big impetus for our top line sales. And with the introduction of stacks of stacks a little density will increase. On the DRAM I just said it I think we just need to -- we'll probably see each of those 3 DRAM players from time to time, put up a new facility. I think it's needed. Otherwise how do we get to 20%, 25% bit growth. So I don't see an issue there either. And again it's driven by logic, 7-nanometer will be rolled out by at least the production tools will be rolled out end of the year, beginning 2019 for volume production 2020 by our customers. That's happening, it will be EUV. So all in all, it looks pretty solid.\nAnalysts: Let's switch over to products. I mean EUV is a good place to start. You've had strong orders last few quarters. I think there is still a little bit remaining in 2019 capacity to be filled. How should we think about the order intake for the rest of this year in order to basically account for the capacity plan to build for next year? Should we assume you're on track to receive those orders this year?\nExecutives: Yes, I think we've seen some good order intake over the last couple of quarters. I think that will continue throughout the remainder of the year. We have this build capacity for about 30 units. For 2019 and 40% to 45% in 2020. That will be when we use that full capacity I think so, that has to because I think we're confident that the performance targets that our customers are looking at for widespread introduction of EUV, those performance targets are basically twofold. One has to do with the intrinsic productivity of the machine. We targeted for 2020 a machine that could 125 wafers per hour and that was based on our ability to create 250 watts of EUV power. We've achieved that the end of last year and we're actually rolling this out. And we are seeing now at customer sites today, 250 watt end customers outputting 125 wafers per hour or more. And why do you say or more, there's an opportunity there that we have indeed created improvements to the EUV source whereby and to the scanner, whereby we get more power on the wafer. So we have now a plan to have 150 wafers per hour as a intrinsic capability of the tool by 2020, which is good because you can then get that on a continuous basis that is more value, it also means a higher price tool, which is good for the margin also. \nSo that's one. Secondly the productivity, second is the availability of the tool. This is still an immature tool. It's highly complex technology. We are targeting to have a 92% availability by 2020, which by the way it won't stop there. I said earlier in the deep UV memory space, our availability percentage of 96% to 97% so there's no fundamental reason why we couldn't get there the 95%, 96% in the EUV space. There will be after 2020. So our focus is completely on getting to that 92%, we have a target by of 80% by the end of the year, which I think is particularly important to our -- for our customers because when you put an EUV tool in your fab, you won't be able to plan on this also and that's why the availability percentage is at this moment is the key focus area because we can basically declare victory on that 125 wafers per hour. And that is just industrial engineering. It's a lot of tedious work. We do together with our customers. We have the fullest confidence that we'll get there by 2020 that we'll have at least 92% availability. So with those 2 parameters, in place, then the economics for EUV makes so much sense. And this is why I have no doubt that we'll have the orders to make sure that we can use our capacity. And I think we've seen a lot of progress over the last 6 to 12 months on productivity, on availability, some breakthroughs all in all collected tradition, this is not EUV collectively just in the EUVsource that captures the EUV light and beams the decade due to. That collected big mirror, that separate from you could call it, degradation because the pollution of the thin on the service with some breakthroughs over the last quarter, which gives us the confidence that the 92% should be very realistic by 2020.\nAnalysts: Yes, I mean so I guess the other part of that, I attended the SPIE Advance Lithography a couple of month ago, this is obviously important conference for ASML. Clearly a lot of progress in the ecosystem you've already talked about the progress on your side. You think about the other parts of the ecosystem photoresist, pellicle, so forth, I mean, how do you see that interest readiness today and what are the remaining sort of things to tackle, I guess higher transmission pellicles, photoresist sensitivity, how do you see the ecosystem at this point?\nExecutives: I think it's -- what you're seeing is that the suppliers of those solutions, whether it's the membrane that you put in front of the photomask, which is called the pellicle, that pellicle, the first pellicle has a transmission in the 70%, so you're losing very valuable EUV light. That transmission is steadily going up. Just a matter of R&D and the same holds true for the photoresist which is the chemical layer, the photosensitive there that you put on top off the waiver. Net development really started when the suppliers kind of pretty good idea that this too was really working. Now so that's been relatively recent. So you're seeing the R&D work in that space only just starting. And you're seeing quite significant progress on photosensitivity. And that's very important because the more sensitive it as, the more the faster you can move that way for the higher end of productivity. So it all leads to cost reduction. And in those 2 spaces specifically pellicle, with also masked preparation and mask inspection and photo resist, and I want to know road blocks. There are development programs that need to bring us to our targets by 2020 when we started a volume production of 7-nanometer. And if you look at the progress that has been made on those particular parts of the ecosystem, that's been quite impressive. I have little doubt that by 2020, on those particular parameters for those parts, we will meet the targets.\nAnalysts: And I agree it certainly a lot of progress in the ecosystem. Back to your side, the margins in EUV are still low. How do you see those progressing? What kind of programs [indiscernible] in place to kind of bring those up so you can meet your 2020 targets, your gross margin targets?\nExecutives: No I think the gross margin has been a disappointment for all of us. It has to do that with the fact that a significant infrastructure built for EUV and little shipment. So we had a lot of fit in our fixed cost. So the biggest driver for margin improvement is it all volume. So once we have 40 systems outlook out of our current capacity, now we have our full load in our factory which is a significant impact on our gross margin. That's one. Number two is the mix. Like I said earlier, when we're able to give our customers 92% availability with 150 wafers per hour instead of 125, then you also have a higher value, which is the higher price of the tool, which of course also adds to the gross margin. Third it's cost reduction. Simply because we're on a learning curve that is not finished yet. So we are reducing cost with our suppliers also. So we have very clear cost targets agreed with our suppliers in the supply chain which will also reduce the product cost. And fourth, I think is very important part is service. We have built up a significant service infrastructure to support our customers around the world not only with people but also with parts and with investments locally and those service cost currently don't have a lot of coverage because we are still in warranty. Now we've agreed with our customers that we don't charge service cost per wafer. So that means that the reason why we want to do right with our customers are available to this proposal it is because when it makes the service cost variable, and two there is a win-win situation there because if we can make our tools so reliable that 92% becomes 95%, then that actually produce more wafers out of this critical tool which is very cost effective for them and it creates more incentive for us because it produces more income. And when you look at this our target is to have per machine per year about EUR 5 million to EUR 6 million of service revenue. So if you have the tools out there generating service revenue, that's [ EUR 500 million to EUR 600 million ]. Now we have an installed base and an infrastructure there that's currently not covered. But will be covered by 2020 when we start seeing that in 2018 shipments will be then serviceable. And 2019 shipments will be serviceable in 2021. So this will grow pretty quick and will also help the gross margin to our target of [ 40% ] in 2020, which of course is just a point in time. I mean there's no reason why EUV gross margins shouldn't be higher going forward. But that's a matter of time and like I said, growing against the base, making sure that we can keep executing on the cost reductions and I think there's a very clear path forward.\nAnalysts: Just sort of last question EUV, but you have announced nur High-NA tool, certainly I guess the starting point of EUV, there's a lot of work on the source. One can imagine the optics might be the challenge here, what do you see as being the key sort of R&D things to address with High-NA compared to I guess your first provisions?\nExecutives: That's a good question. I think the puts of the High-NA orders for us it's really been the fact that it's at an upon image of the customer base some of our key customers that as we said EUV is here to stay. And we're going to commit EUR 1.5 billion of our cash, of our money to this R&D development of the next generation EUV because we need it. We need it for 3-nanometer, we need it for 2-nanometer. I think it is an acknowledgment of the fact that EUV is here to stay. Now what is different there is to put it into perspective, by the end of this year, Carl Zeiss and [indiscernible] invested something like EUR 10 billion into EUV. To bring it to the point where now we can say we will bring it into volume production. That bill for High-NA will be about half, about [ EUR 5 billion ]. And that shows you that we believe that the R&D effort to bring High-NA to the market will be less than the current. And has to do with the fact that we don't need to develop a new source. That EUV source has been literally the source of a lot of costs and delay because it has been extremely difficult. Now we are where we are but that source design will be mature by 2020, 2021. Even more mature when we go into volume production by 2025. And that will be the same source that we will use in the High-NA to development. That is really high NA is sort of our new optical system in their which is bigger, which will then be the biggest scanner, the better overlay performance because we keep shrinking the resolution and then that is where the rest of the R&D money and CapEx will be spent on. I think it's going to be significant. We also think that the gross margins that we will see at high NA will be significant a higher than when we currently see with the introduction of EUV, one reason is we don't need the learning curve of the EUV source, I mentioned that. And secondly, in the development of the optical system, we agreed with Carl ZEISS that we would take 25% in their business unit that is actually responsible for this optical design and the vast majority of the R&D and cap expert now how do we get and return on that investment? By basically agreeing with them that we should look at this high NA business has a two companies, one business, business plan. And that means that we agreed on an equal internal rate of return for them and for us. However, if we invest the vast majority of the money in absolute terms and also in absolute terms our return is a lot higher and how do we get that money back there reduction of the lesser price. And the reduction of that lens price would also need to have an impact on the gross margin. So this is how we've managed and scheduled the introduction for the high NA, which will be around 2025 in volume, first R&D tools, end of 2021, beginning 2022, early volume systems in 2024 and then the volume systems 2025 and beyond, and that will bring us beyond 2030 and that will bring your roadmap to 1.5-nanometer. And that's beyond 2030.\nAnalysts: I guess just on EUV how it relates to foundry logic I mean you're clearly getting the orders in shipping this year. There's been thoughts that maybe Apple wouldn't use it for their X processors until next year. On the other hand, I think that the leading logic player pretty much came on, so they need EUV for [ 7 ] and some questions on the timing there. I guess how should we really think about production ramp how it relates to the leading logic, leading foundry and there is also another foundry players as well thinking about 7-nanometer or how should we really think about when the volume production begins and how that ramps.\nExecutives: I think it's clear that 7-nanometer and so different nomenclature here also. This nomenclature of 5 but the way that we look at it when we look at the effective resolution, we say industry 7, which includes this 5-nanometer nomenclature. The industry 7, which is volume introduction 2020, by our customers, that's only -- it's EUV. And then it depends on the risk appetite of customers, where they say or how much layers they would want to apply on the EUV because EUV is a new technology that ranges from [ 6 to 7 to over 10 ]. So that every logic maker is in that area. So there's no plan B. I mean that's what 2 of them at least [indiscernible] you have to get EUV working for us because at 7-nanometer, we don't have plan B. Now it is also been very clear as statement of our customers or at 10-nanometer, the issues with very complex multiple patterning has such a dramatic impact on yield that almost at the point where you say this is a dead end street. So we need EUV. There's no doubt about it and that's also the reason why we see the orders currently at 36 orders for EUV in our order book, EUR 4 billion, and that's all being prepared for 7-nanometer.\nAnalysts: Okay, any questions from the audience? If you do, wait for the mic. We'll keep going then. You mentioned earlier about probably the leading DRAM customers is going to be the first to market with EUV, one would assume. 1x, 1 wide onesie, what's the timing of the DRAM, and how does that impact also even the logic ramp as you consider how they can test EUV in one device then use it for the other device?\nExecutives: That is probably, if you do both. I mean you have a DRAM roadmap where you want to use EUV, you have a logic roadmap where you want to use EUV and you have an advantage very this as your learning on both sides. And that's nothing different than what you're doing in the but he also. I think if you have both this particular advantage. Now I think on DRAM EUV and EUV is different economics very much. And that has to do with the fact that you can replace some multiple patterning layers with EUV layers, but then you need to show consistent performance of productivity, which that target has been set to 2,000 wafers per day. It can then calculate that's the raw throughput per hour times 24 hours times the availability. And then you need to multiply that with the tool efficiency. And that's the way that the customers run the tool and that means that with -- for 2,000 wafers per day, we need to be around 125 wafers per hour and about 88% availability. And that happens to be our target by the end of the year. So when we meet that target, then we meet the 2,000 wafers per day threshold. And that means that will be a very logical time and place for as a DRAM maker to start putting EUV into DRAM. And that's for the upcoming generation and that generation after that probably it will arise from 1 or 2 to 4, but of course DRAM has a lot of flavor so that is there will be a big driver for EUV sales going forward.\nAnalysts: Okay, I want to switch product I mean you obviously acquired HMI and you have some without some the opportunity in your broader Holistic Lithography scheme. There is an expansion aspect and there's more pattern fidelity and again sort of died your holistic. And then you also have recently started doing mass inspection. So you have a tool in the field, foundry logic customer, I mean how do you have additional wins at this point? What is the timing of selection? I mean effectively it's needed now but realistically, maybe just for future generations, what will are the key where with mass inspection business for your program?\nExecutives: Well mass inspection is when you think about the HMI portfolio, which is just a nice add on, that is not what we're focusing on, we're focusing on, wafer inspection. And that with the multi-beam tool. Because we believe that productivity is extremely important. Because it reduces the cost per wafer. And that's where the focus is, focus is on a high productivity multi-beam tool, which will be integrated in the lithography architecture of ASML, basically using the data coming out of those measurement points, those control points, using that to refine the model so that we can actually use all the knobs in this scanner to optimize the manufacturing process, which leads to actual yield improvement, so it's a feedback and the feedforward so that is the key focus. And that is the key focus why we have emerged are required HMI because of their competence in combination with a computational power and now scanner power of ASML is pretty unique. And a nice add on is on EUV mass inspection, it's a market which is probably going to be EUR 200 million, EUR 300 million in size. Part of it can be used still doubtful we don't want exactly where we can use the mass inspection tool fully for what is needed in mass inspection because the face shifts are a bit of an issue. So that makes further investigation and further R&D. But it's a nice add on but really when we need that mass inspection is when 7-nanometer goes into volume production, which we said was 2020. And so all in all, we're very happy with HMI acquisition and integration, the integration is being focused on product and product integration and new product development. This patent fidelity tool that we have shift at the end of last year first is really linking pain in that Holistic feedback and feedforward strategy that we are having. In the first feedback from the customer is very positive. Then we need to complement that with the high-speed multi-beam tool which is not only a multi-beam column but you can imagine you have to move that wafer stage very fast so you have fast way for stages, which happens to be one of our core competency. This is where you see I would say. amalgamation of the HMI and the ASML specific product technology in tell you product which is pretty unit. So we're very excited there and our target is to grow this combined ASML HMI business to EUR 1 billion by 2020, which was the reason why we upped our initial EUR 10 billion target for 2020 with another EUR 1 billion to EUR 11 billion, and we're pretty confident that we're going to get there.\nAnalysts: Okay, I guess the last question related to your 2020, you talked about R&D as a percentage of revenue around 13%. Your current run rate is actually higher than that. So should we assume that R&D will normalize at that level as we approach that target?\nExecutives: I think I would stick to the 17% OpEx, which is sort of 13% R&D, 4% SG&A, also by 2020, which if people do the math could indicate and say well you're pulling some of the R&D for high NA, because it now needs to be pulled in 2 or 3 years, so that R&D will be higher, then you can also deduce that the EUR 11 billion for us is not a very difficult target by 2020. It's probably going to be a bit higher.\nAnalysts: With that, we're out of time. Thanks again, Peter.\nExecutives: Thank you very much, Bill.\nAnalysts: Thanks.\nAnalysts: Okay, good morning, everyone. My name is Bill Peterson, I work on the U.S. Semiconductor Equipment Research team. We have here today is, well,Peter Wennink, the CEO of ASML. I'm doing a fireside chat, on behalf of my colleague, Sandeep, who is based in London. \nPeter is going to give some opening comments about ASML, and then we'll move to Q&A and then I'll open up later on. But it's certainly a pleasure to have you here, Peter. Thanks a lot for coming.\nExecutives: Okay, Bill, thanks. Yes, I think perhaps good to basically give you a couple of minutes of comments as a result of the 1.5 days that we've been spending here in Boston and talking about our business, our industry. And I'd like to start off with one of -- there's a lot of questions that we've got over the last 1.5 days, it was about -- were about the cycle. And that's quite interesting because some people said, well, do we still have a cycle? And I think the following is basically where we are. And I think the industry has significantly consolidated over the last 10 years. So we will always have, in this industry, pockets in time where when you look at our business and our customer base, logic, DRAM and NAND, within those segments, there are only a few players left. And when those players all decide to basically put -- a capacity of those would be mega fabs, that's often costing more than $10 billion each, you will have a step-up in capacity. So that is unavoidable. I don't think it's very bad. If you look, for instance, in 3D NAND, the CAGR there is 45%. So yes, if you put up as extra capacity in the step-up function, it will grow into it quite rapidly also. \nNow when we talk about the industry, I think the most important thing that we need to remind ourselves, obviously, is that this industry is very much driven by what happens in logic. Why? Because the logic fuels the compute power that is needed in all those areas that we're currently so excited about, whether it's artificial intelligence, Big Data, it's the cloud or it's self-driving cars, it's crypto mining, it doesn't matter. I mean, it's all about the high-power compute. And high-power compute is driven by the ability of our customers to keep shrinking. And effectively saying, the roadmap of that particular shrink, which is now at 10 nanometer, again our customers effectively bring it down to 7, 5, 3, 2, 1.5, which will bring us beyond 2030. \nI think the answer to that is yes, I think we can do that. And that means that given the wide array of applications that we're currently seeing, that can be -- that actually use the compute power, which is so much more applications, and the application space is so much more wider than 5 or 10 years ago, that -- the industry is then, once they get to a 7-nanometer node, the speed with which it will ramp up a certain level of capacity is also higher. That's what we're seeing today. And that's actually fueled our business over the next -- over the last 3 years and for the next couple of years. The ramp-up speed of the new technology is very high, and it has been very high, and logic has been our most prominent part of our business for the last 3 years. And I think it will be for the next couple of years. \nNow let me start with logic. You have high-power compute capability. There's this siamese twin that is tied to logic, which is called high-performance memory, which is DRAM. So when you have a relatively fast growing ramp-up of new technology and the roadmap can be executed because of EUV, then we also need high-performance bits. And the last 2 years and also this year, we estimate a 25% bit growth in DRAM this year. \nNow something has happened in the DRAM space over the last couple of years and going forward, and that's that there's the one area, the one segment of the industry where Moore's Law is slowing down. You see the innovations are going from a node-to-node time of 2 years to 4 years, which effectively means that every year, we won't be able to add like we did in the past because of technology transitions, 15% to 20% bits, just because of technology transitions. It's more like 10% to 15%. Now if your DRAM demand, which is very tightly tied to the rollout of your logic roadmap, if that requires 25% bit growth, you can only get 10%, 15% max, fully closer to 10% through the technology transitions. And how do you get that extra -- those extra bits? By wafers. You have to put extra wafers. \nNow this is actually -- that didn't happen over the last 2 years, which is the reason why DRAM pressure showed up. It's very simple. It's a supply-and-demand equation. Now DRAM wafer capacity installed base actually didn't grow. As a matter of fact, it went down because over the last couple of years, some of those DRAM tools went to do the 3D NAND space. Now how were our customers able then to still deliver 25%, albeit that the prices went up? It's because the productivity in those fabs went up quite significantly. When we look at the wafer-per-day records that we saw 2 years ago on our tools, it was about 4,500 wafers. Now we're now closing [ up to ] 6,000 wafers per day. \nSo just cranking out more wafers has been the solution. And that means that in some DRAM fabs, we're at 97% availability constantly. Now you cannot be at 100% because you need some overhead. So what is the availability of our customers to keep getting more wafers out? That is limited. So we need to build fabs. \nAnd this is what's actually happening. I mean, one of our customers is -- has emptied a particular fab where that production went to a 3D NAND new development, and that open space is now being filled with DRAM tools and luckily so. \nNow we've looked going forward, and we see this development of logic, 7-nanometer, 5-nanometer, 3, in an application space that is growing. That means that the ramp-up speed of the new technology will be high, we need high-performance DRAM. So in our mind, there's actually a need for more DRAM wafers. We don't see this as a kind of a build-up bubble coming.\nThat's just DRAM. On 3D NAND, which is storage, now clearly 45% CAGR is very nice and it's good. But you see more players in this space. I mean, where we have 3 major players in DRAM, we have 6 in 3D NAND, and over a timeframe of 2, 2.5 years, we see all these 6 players putting new capacity in place. That's not all at the same time. It's also not a very homogeneous group of customers. You have start-up customers in China and you have very mature customers in Korea. And they all -- but they're all planning for a capacity expansion. That will happen over a relatively long period 2, 2.5 years. So you will see from time to time these pockets of extra capacity coming up, which will probably drive the price weakness. It's a pretty price-elastic market, but that's normal. And with the CAGR of 45%, I think they will grow into that -- into those pockets of extra capacity relatively quick. \nSo all in all, long introduction for that, sorry for that Bill. I know you have a lot of questions, so there won't be a lot of time left. But this is where we are. And it's not only where we are today, I think this is where the industry will be for the next couple of years. And again, critical here is will the industry, and we're partner in that industry, will that industry be able to keep following the roadmap and execute that roadmap in a cost-effective manner, and we believe that we will be able to do so.\nAnalysts: Okay. Great, thanks for that. And we have some questions on the end market, and you've kind of addressed a lot of that. But I guess maybe just specific to memory. I think you've said in the past that you have a pretty good feel for DRAM capacity. So at least it sounds like you don't really see the imminent over signs of supply. NAND, you've kind of commented you have less visibility, but I think you do have a visibility to whether or not they're either going to be stacked or not. So I know order has been strong in NAND, but I guess sort of a two-part question. First on NAND is, how do you see the requirements for litho for next-generation 3D NAND evolving? And then, really, for DRAM, I guess, obviously, spending has been high this year. How do you see that sort of trending over, say, the next 6 to 12 months?\nExecutives: Yes. I think, like I said earlier, 3 segments: logic DRAM and NAND. I think only in DRAM we see a slowing of Moore's Law, we don't see it in logic and we don't see it in NAND. I mean, the bit density increase is basically managed through stacking more layers, basically creating more layers on top of each other. Ultimately, we've seen our roadmaps where customers are looking at a 92 layers for 3D NAND. Now but out of the 92 layers, you don't build them on top of each other. It's very clear that our customers are now talking about creating a stack of, let's say, 64 layers and then creating an intermediate layer and then putting all the stack of 64 on top, creating an intermediate layer, putting all the stack of 64 on top. So we've made stacks of stacks. But that connection between those stacks is highly litho intensive. So it's good for us because it actually means that although as compared to 2D NAND, if you have a greenfield 3D NAND fab, you need 10% more litho. The way it's -- doing stacks on stacks, you need another 15% to 20% extra litho per stack. So that is good for us, and I think we'll just see that. But it's not only the fact that we're stacking stacks. It's also that the specific requirements on lithography tools is different in 3D NAND because we have opaque layers which are very difficult to align layer, 2 layers, so we have specific solutions that we're creating in our dry Deep UV tools, also creating value for our customers. So it all is developing into an area where we are increasingly providing more value to our NAND customers. Going forward, like I said, there are 6 NAND customers for the next 2, 2.5 years that will -- are either in the process of or have just finished or are preparing to build new capacity. And that, of course, will be a big driver, big impetus for our top line sales. And with the introduction of stacks of -- stacks of little density will increase. On the DRAM, I just said it, I think we just need -- we'll probably see each of those 3 DRAM players from time to time, put up a new facility. I think it's needed. Otherwise, how do we get to 20%, 25% bit growth. So I don't see an issue there either. And again it's, driven by logic. 7-nanometer will be rolled out by -- at least the production tools will be rolled out, end of the year, beginning of 2019 for volume production 2020 by our customers. That's happening. It will be EUV. So all in all, it looks pretty solid.\nAnalysts: Okay. Let's switch over to products. I mean, EUV is a good place to start. You've had strong orders in last few quarters. I think there's still a little bit remaining in 2019 capacity to be filled. How should we think about the order intake for the rest of this year in order to basically account for the capacity plan to build for next year? Should we assume you're on track to receive those orders this year?\nExecutives: Yes, I think we've seen some good order intake over the last couple of quarters. I think that will continue throughout the remainder of the year. We have this build capacity for about 30 units for 2019 and 40% to 45% in 2020. That will be when we'll use that full capacity? I think so. That has to do because I think we're confident that the performance targets that our customers are looking at for a widespread introduction of EUV, those performance targets are basically twofold. One has to do with the intrinsic productivity of the machine. We target it, for 2020, a machine that could 125 wafers per hour and it was based on our ability to create 250 watts of EUV power. We've achieved that at the end of last year, and we're actually rolling this out. And we're seeing now at customer sites, today, 250-watt end customers outputting 125 wafers per hour or more. And why do I say or more, there is an opportunity there that we have indeed created improvements to the EUV source, whereby -- and to the scanner, whereby we get more power on the wafer. So we have now a plan to have 150 wafers per hour as a intrinsic capability of the tool by 2020, which is good because if you can then get that on a continuous basis, then it's more value, it also means a higher price tool, which is good for the margin also. So that's one. Second to it is the productivity. Second is the availability of the tool. This is still an immature tool. It's highly complex technology. We're targeting to have a 92% availability by 2020, which, by the way, it won't stop there. I said earlier in the Deep UV memory space, our availability percentage of 96% to 97%. So there's no fundamental reason why we couldn't get there, the 95%, 96% in the EUV space. We will be after 2020. So our focus is completely on getting to that 92%. We have a target by -- of 88% by the end of the year, which I think is particularly important to our -- for our customers because when you put an EUV tool in your fab, you won't be able to plan on this also, and that's why the availability percentage is, at this moment, is the key focus area because we can basically declare victory on the 125 wafers per hour. And that is just industrial engineering. It's a lot of tedious work. We do this together with our customers, and we have the fullest confidence that we'll get there by 2020, that we'll have at least 92% availability. So with those 2 parameters in place, then the economics for EUV makes so much sense. And this is why I have no doubt that we'll have the orders to make sure that we can use our capacity. And I think we've made a lot of progress over the last 6 to 12 months on productivity, on availability, some breakthroughs on the collector  degradation, this is the EUV collector, which is in the EUV source that captures the EUV light and beams and back into tool. That collector big mirror, that's separate from, you could call it, degradation because the pollution of the tint on the service, with some breakthroughs over the last quarter, which gives us the confidence that the 92% should be very realistic by 2020.\nAnalysts: Yes, I mean, so I guess the other part of that, I attended the SPIE Advanced Lithography a couple of month ago. This is obviously an important conference for ASML. Clearly, a lot of progress in the ecosystem. You've already talked about the progress on your side. You think about the other parts of the ecosystem, photoresist, pellicle, so forth, I mean, how do you see that interest readiness today and what are the remaining sort of things to tackle, I guess higher transmission pellicles, photoresist sensitivity, how do you see the ecosystem at this point?\nExecutives: I think it's -- what you're seeing is that the suppliers of those solutions, whether it's the membrane that you put in front of the photomask, which is called the pellicle, that pellicle, the first pellicle has a transmission in the 70%. So you're losing very valuable EUV light. That transmission is steadily going up, just a matter of R&D. And the same holds true for the photoresist which is the chemical layer, the photosensitive layer that you put on top off the wafer. That development really started when the suppliers, kind of pretty good idea that this too was really working. Now so that's been relatively recent. So you're seeing the R&D work in that space only just starting. And you're seeing quite significant progress on photoresist sensitivity. And that's very important because the more sensitive it as, the more -- the faster you can move the wafer to higher productivity. So it all leads to cost reduction. And I think in those 2 spaces, specifically, pellicle, but also masked preparation and mask inspection and photoresist, and I want to know road blocks. Anyway, there are development programs that need to bring us to our targets by 2020 when we started a volume production of 7-nanometer. And if you look at the progress that has been made on those particular parts of the ecosystem, that's been quite impressive. So I have little doubt that by 2020, on those particular parameters for those parts, we will meet the targets.\nAnalysts: Sure. And I agree, there's certainly a lot of progress in the ecosystem. Back to your side, the margins in EUV are still low. How do you see those progressing? What kind of programs do you seem to have in place to kind of bring those up, so you can meet your 2020 targets, gross margin targets?\nExecutives: I think the gross margin has been a disappointment for all of us. It has to do that with the fact that we have a significant infrastructure built for EUV and little shipment. So we had a lot of fixed cost. So the biggest driver for margin improvement is the volume. So once we have 4D systems output out of our current capacity, now we have a full load in our factory, which has a significant impact on our gross margin. That's one. Number two is the mix. Like I said earlier, when we're able to give our customers 92% availability with 150 wafers per hour instead of 125, then you also have a higher value, which are higher price of the tool, which of course also adds to the gross margin. Third, it's cost reduction, simply because we're on a learning curve that is not finished yet. So we are reducing cost with our suppliers also. So we have very clear cost targets agreed with our suppliers in the supply chain, which will also reduce the product cost. And fourth, I think is a very important part is service. We have built up a significant service infrastructure to support our customers around the world, not only with people but also with parts and with investments locally and those service cost currently don't have a lot of coverage because we're still in warranty. Now we've agreed with our customers that we don't charge a service cost per wafer. So it's -- and that means that the reason why we want to do it with our customers are evitable to this proposal is because, one, it makes the service cost variable and, two, there is a win-win situation there. Because if we can make our tools so reliable, that the 92% becomes 95%, then that actually produce more wafers out of this critical tool, which is very cost-effective for them and it creates more incentive for us because it gives us more income. And then we look at this, our target is to have per machine per year, about EUR 5 million to EUR 6 million of service revenue. So if you have the tools out there generating service revenue, that's EUR 500 million to EUR 600 million. Now we have an installed base and an infrastructure there that's currently not covered, but will be covered by 2020 when we start seeing that the 2018 shipments will be then serviceable. And 2019 shipments will be serviceable in 2021. So this will grow pretty quick and will also help the gross margin to our target of 40% in 2020, which of course is just a point in time. I mean, there's no reason why EUV gross margins shouldn't be higher going forward, but that's a matter of time, and like I said, growing the installed base, making sure that we can keep executing on the cost reductions, and I think there's a very clear path forward.\nAnalysts: Just sort of last question in EUV, but you have announced your High-NA tool. Certainly, I guess the starting point of EUV, there's a lot of work on the source. One can imagine the optics might be the challenge here. But what do you see as being the key sort of R&D things to address with High-NA compared to, I guess, your first provisions?\nExecutives: That's a good question. I think the puts of the High-NA orders for us has really been the fact that it's an acknowledgment of the customer base some, of our key customers. It actually said, EUV is here to stay. And we're going to commit EUR 1.5 billion of our cash, of our money to this R&D development of the next-generation EUV because we need it. We need it for 3-nanometer, we need it for 2-nanometer. I think it is an acknowledgment of the fact that EUV is here to stay. Now what is different there, just to put it into perspective, by the end of this year, Carl Zeiss and ASML have probably invested something like EUR 10 billion into EUV, to bring it to the point where now we can say, we will bring it into volume production. That bill for High-NA will be about half, about [ EUR 5 billion ]. And that shows you that we believe that the R&D effort to bring High-NA to the market will be less than the current. And it has to do with the fact that we don't need to develop a new source. The EUV source has been literally the source of a lot of cost and delay because it had been extremely difficult. Now we are where we are, but that source design will be mature by 2020, 2021, and even more mature when we go into volume production by 2025. And that will be the same source that we will use in the High-NA to development. Then it's -- really, High-NA is sort of our new optical system in there which is bigger, which will then need a bigger scanner with better overlay performance because we keep shrinking the resolution. And then that is where the rest of the R&D money and the CapEx will be spent on. I think it's going to be significant. We also think that the gross margins that we will see at High-NA will be significantly higher than what we currently see with the introduction of EUV. One reason is we don't need the learning curve of the EUV source, I mentioned that. And secondly, in the development of the optical system, we agreed with Carl Zeiss that we would take 25% in their business unit, that actually is responsible for this optical design and we'd the vast majority of the R&D and CapEx. Now how do we get a return on that investment? By basically agreeing with them that we should look at this High-NA business as a 2 companies and 1 business, business plan. And that means that we agreed on an equal internal rate of return for them and for us. However, if we invest the vast majority of the money in absolute terms and also in absolute terms, our return is a lot higher and how do we get that money back the reduction of the lens price. And the reduction of that lens price will of course remain to have an impact on the gross margin. So this is how we've managed and scheduled the introduction for the High-NA, which will be around 2025 in volume, first R&D tools, end of 2021, beginning 2022, early volume systems in 2024 and then the volume systems, 2025 and beyond. And that will bring us beyond 2030 and that will bring your roadmap to 1.5-nanometer. And that's beyond 2030.\nAnalysts: I guess just on EUV, how it relates to foundry logic. I mean, you're clearly giving the orders in shipping this year. There's been thoughts that maybe Apple wouldn't use it for -- in their X processors until next year. On the other hand, I think that the leading logic player pretty much came on, so they need EUV for 7, and some questions on the timing there. I guess how should we really think about production ramp, how it relates to the leading logic, leading foundry. And there's also other foundry players as well, thinking about 7-nanometer. So how should we really think about when the volume production begins and how that ramps.\nExecutives: T\nI think it's clear, it's 7-nanometer, and some different nomenclature here also. This nomenclature of 5, but if -- the way that we look at it, we look at the effective resolution, we say industry, 7, which then includes this 5-nanometer nomenclature. The industry's 7, which is volume introduction, 2020, by our customers, that only is EUV. And then it depends on the risk appetite of customers, where they say how much layers we would want to apply on EUV because EUV is a new technology, that ranges from 6 to 7 to over 10 in that area. And that's every logic maker is in that area. There's no plan B. I mean, that's what 2 of them at least told us and said, listen, \"You have to get EUV working for us because at 7-nanometer, we don't have plan B.\" Now it has also been very clear, a statement of our customers, at 10-nanometer, the issues with very complex multiple patterning has such a dramatic impact on yield that almost at the point where you say this is a dead-end street. So we need EUV, there's no doubt about it and that's also the reason why we see the orders currently at 36 orders for EUV in our order book, EUR 4 billion, and that's all being prepared for 7-nanometer.\nAnalysts: Okay. Any questions from the audience? If you do, wait for the mic. We'll keep going then. You mentioned earlier about probably the leading 3, DRAM customers is going to be the first to market with EUV, one would assume 1x, 1y, 1z. What's the timing of the DRAM. And how does that impact even the logic ramp as you consider how they can test EUV in one device, and use it for the other device?\nExecutives: That is probably, if you do both. I mean, you have a DRAM roadmap where you want to use EUV. You have a logic roadmap where you want to use EUV and have an advantage in the sense there's learning on both sides. And that's nothing different than what they've been doing in Deep UV also. I think that's why if you have both, you have this particular advantage. Now I think on DRAM EUV, and DRAM is really driven by economics very much. And that has to do with the fact that you can replace some multiple patterning layers with EUV layers. But then you need to show a consistent performance of productivity, which that target has been set at 2,000 wafers per day. It can then calculate that's the raw throughput per hour times 24 hours times the availability. And then you need to multiply that with the tool efficiency. And that's the way that the customers run the tool. And that means that with -- for 2,000 wafers per day, we need to be at 125 wafers per hour and about 88% availability. And that happens to be our target by the end of the year. So when we meet that target, then we meet the 2,000 wafers per day threshold. And that would mean, that will be a very logical time and place for, as a DRAM maker, to start putting EUV into DRAM. And that's for the upcoming generation. And the generation after that, the number of layers will probably arise from 1 or 2 to 4. But of course DRAM has a lot of wafers, that is -- there will be -- that's a big driver for EUV sales going forward.\nAnalysts: Okay, I want to switch products. I mean you, obviously, you've acquired HMI, and you have, with that, some new opportunity in your broader Holistic Lithography scheme. There's an inspection aspect and there's more pattern fidelity and, again, sort of tied to your Holistic. And then you also have recently started doing mask inspection. So you have a tool in the field, foundry logic customer, I mean how do you -- do you have additional wins at this point? What is the timing of selection? What is -- I mean, effectively, it's needed now, but realistically, maybe just for future generations. But what are the key performance criteria within mask  inspection business for your program\nExecutives: Well, mask inspection is, when you think about the HMI product portfolio, was just a nice add-on. That is not what we're focusing on. We're focusing on, wafer inspection. And that with the multi-beam tool. Because we believe that productivity is extremely important because it reduces the cost per wafer. And that's where the focus is, the focus is on a high-productivity multi-beam tool, which will be integrated in the Holistic Lithography architecture of ASML, basically using the data coming out of those measurement points, those control points, using that to refine the model so that we can actually use all the knobs in the scanner to optimize the manufacturing process, which leads to actual yield improvement. So it's a feedback and the feed forward, that is the key focus. And that's just the key focus why we have merged or acquired HMI because their competence, in combination with the computational power and the scanner power of ASML, is pretty unique. And a nice add-on is on EUV mask inspection. It's a market which is probably going to be EUR 200 million, EUR 300 million in size. Part of it can be used. Still doubtful, we don't know exactly whether we can use the mask inspection tool fully for what is needed in mask inspection because the face shifts are a bit of an issue. So that needs further investigation and further R&D. But it's a nice add-on. But really, when we need that mask inspection is when 7-nanometer goes into volume production, which we said it was 2020. And so all in all, we're very happy with the HMI acquisition and the integration. The integration is being focused on product and product integration and new product development. This patent fidelity tool that we have shift at the end of last year first is really the linking pin in that holistic feedback and feedforward strategy that we're having. And the first feedback from the customer is very positive. And we need to complement that with the high-speed multi-beam tool, which is not only a multi-beam column, but you can imagine you have to move the wafer stage very fast, so you have fast wafer for stages, which happens to be one of our core competency. And this is where you see, I would say, amalgamation of the HMI and the ASML specific product technology into a new product which is pretty unique. So we're very excited there, and our target is to grow this combined ASML, HMI business to EUR 1 billion by 2020, which was the reason why we upped our initial EUR 10 billion target for 2020 with another EUR 1 billion to EUR 11 billion, and we're pretty confident that we're going to get there.\nAnalysts: Okay, I guess the last question, and related to your 2020, if you talk about R&D as a percentage of revenue around 13%. Your current run rate is actually higher than that. So should we assume that R&D will normalize at that level as we approach that target?\nExecutives: I think I would stick to the 17% OpEx, which is 13% R&D, 4% SG&A, also by 2020, which if people do the math, could indicate and say, well you're pooling in some of the R&D for High-NA, because it now needs to be pooled in 2 or 3 years, so that R&D will be higher, then you can also deduce that the EUR 11 billion for us is not a very difficult target by 2020. It's probably going to be a bit higher.\nAnalysts: Okay. With that, we're out of time. Thanks again, Peter.\nExecutives: Thank you very much, Bill.\nAnalysts: Thanks.\nAnalysts: Okay, good morning, everyone. My name is Bill Peterson, I work on the U.S. Semiconductor Equipment Research team. We have here today is, well, Peter Wennink, the CEO of ASML. I'm doing a fireside chat, on behalf of my colleague, Sandeep, who is based in London. \nPeter is going to give some opening comments about ASML, and then we'll move to Q&A and then I'll open it up later on. But it's certainly a pleasure to have you here, Peter. Thanks a lot for coming.\nExecutives: Okay, Bill, thanks. Yes, I think perhaps good to basically give you a couple of minutes of comments as a result of the 1.5 days that we've been spending here in Boston and talking about our business, our industry. And I'd like to start off with one of -- there's a lot of questions that we've got over the last 1.5 days, it was about -- were about the cycle. And that's quite interesting because some people said, well, do we still have a cycle? And I think the following is basically where we are. And I think the industry has significantly consolidated over the last 10 years. So you will always have, in this industry, pockets in time where when you look at our business and our customer base, logic, DRAM and NAND, within those segments, there are only a few players left. And when those players all decide to basically put -- a capacity of those would be mega fabs, some of them costing more than $10 billion each, you will have a step-up in capacity. So that is unavoidable. I don't think it's very bad. If you look, for instance, in 3D NAND, the CAGR there is 45%. So yes, if you put up as extra capacity in the step-up function, it will grow into it quite rapidly also. \nNow when we talk about the industry, I think the most important thing that we need to remind ourselves, obviously, is that this industry is very much driven by what happens in logic. Why? Because the logic fuels the compute power that is needed in all those areas that we're currently so excited about, whether it's artificial intelligence, Big Data, it's the cloud or it's self-driving cars, it's crypto mining, it doesn't matter. I mean, it's all about high-power compute. And high-power compute is driven by the ability of our customers to keep shrinking. And effectively saying, the roadmap of that particular shrink, which is now at 10 nanometer, again our customers effectively bring it down to 7, 5, 3, 2, 1.5, which would bring us beyond 2030. \nI think the answer to that is yes, I think we can do that. And that means that given the wide array of applications that we're currently seeing, that can be -- that actually use the compute power, which is so much more applications, and the application space is so much more wider than 5 or 10 years ago, that -- the industry is then, once they get to a 7-nanometer node, the speed with which it will ramp up a certain level of capacity is also higher. That's what we're seeing today. And that's actually fueled our business over the next -- over the last 3 years and for the next couple of years. The ramp-up speed of the new technology is very high, and it has been very high, and logic has been our most prominent part of our business for the last 3 years. And I think it will be for the next couple of years. \nNow let me start with logic. You have high-power compute capability. There's this siamese twin that is tied to logic, which is called high-performance memory, which is DRAM. So when you have a relatively fast growing ramp-up of new technology and the roadmap can be executed because of EUV, then we also need high-performance bits. And the last 2 years and also this year, we estimate a 25% bit growth in DRAM this year. \nNow something has happened in the DRAM space over the last couple of years and going forward, and that's that there's the one area, the one segment of the industry where Moore's Law is slowing down. You see the innovations are going from a node-to-node time of 2 years to 4 years, which effectively means that every year, we won't be able to add like we did in the past because of technology transitions, 15% to 20% bits, just because of technology transitions. It's more like 10% to 15%. Now if your DRAM demand, which is very tightly tied to the rollout of your logic roadmap, if that requires 25% bit growth, and you can only get 10%, 15% max, probably closer to 10% through the technology transitions. And how do you get that extra -- those extra bits? By wafers. You have to put extra wafers. \nNow this is actually -- that didn't happen over the last 2 years, which is the reason why DRAM pressure showed up. It's very simple. It's a supply-and-demand equation. Now DRAM wafer capacity installed base actually didn't grow. As a matter of fact, it went down because over the last couple of years, some of those DRAM tools went into the 3D NAND space. Now how were our customers able then to still deliver 25%, albeit that the prices went up? It's because the productivity in those fabs went up quite significantly. When we look at the wafer-per-day records that we saw 2 years ago on our tools, it was about 4,500 wafers. Now we're now closing into 6,000 wafers per day. \nSo just cranking out more wafers has been the solution. And that means that in some DRAM fabs, you had 97% availability constantly. Now you cannot be at 100% because you need some overhead. So what is the availability of our customers to keep getting more wafers out? That is limited. So we need to build fabs. \nAnd this is what's actually happening. I mean, one of our customers is -- has emptied a particular fab where that production went to a 3D NAND new development, and that open space is now being filled with DRAM tools and luckily so. \nNow we've looked going forward, and we see this development of logic, 7-nanometer, 5-nanometer, 3, in an application space that is growing. That means that the ramp-up speed of the new technology will be high, we need high-performance DRAM. So in our mind, there's actually a need for more DRAM wafers. We don't see this as a kind of a build-up bubble coming.\nAnd, then, that is DRAM. On the 3D NAND, which is storage, now clearly 45% CAGR is very nice and it's good. But you see more players in this space. I mean, where we have 3 major players in DRAM, we have 6 in 3D NAND, and as over a timeframe of 2, 2.5 years, we see all these 6 players putting new capacity in place. That's not all at the same time. It's also not a very homogeneous group of customers. You have start-up customers in China and you have very mature customers in Korea. And they all -- but they're all planning for a capacity expansion. That will happen over a relatively long period 2, 2.5 years. So you will see from time to time these pockets of extra capacity coming up, which will probably drive the price weakness. It's a pretty price-elastic market, but that's normal. And with the CAGR of 45%, I think that we'll grow into that -- into those pockets of extra capacity relatively quick. \nSo all in all, long introduction, sorry for that, sorry for that Bill. I know you have a lot of questions, so there won't be a lot of time left. But this is where we are. And it's not only where we are today, I think this is where the industry will be for the next couple of years. And again, critical here is will the industry, and we're a partner in that industry, will that industry be able to keep following the roadmap and execute that roadmap in a cost-effective manner, and we believe that we will be able to do so.\nAnalysts: Okay. Great, thanks for that. And we have some questions on the end market, and you've kind of addressed a lot of that. But I guess maybe just specific to memory. I think you've said in the past that you have a pretty good feel for DRAM capacity. So at least it sounds like you don't really see the imminent over signs of supply. NAND, you've kind of commented you have less visibility, but I think you do have a visibility to whether or not they're either going to be stacked or not. So I know an order has been strong in NAND, but I guess sort of a two-part question. First on NAND is, how do you see the requirements for litho for next-generation 3D NAND evolving? And then, really, for DRAM, I guess, obviously, spending has been high this year. How do you see that sort of trending over, say, the next 6 to 12 months?\nExecutives: Yes. I think, like I said earlier, 3 segments: logic DRAM and NAND. I think only in DRAM we see a slowing of Moore's Law, we don't see it in logic and we don't see it in NAND. I mean, the bit density increase is basically managed through stacking more layers, basically creating more layers on top of each other. Ultimately, we've seen our roadmaps where customers are looking at a 92 layers for 3D NAND. Now but out of the 92 layers, you don't build them on top of each other. It's very clear that our customers are now talking about creating a stack of, let's say, 64 layers and then creating an intermediate layer and then put another stack of 64 on top, creating an intermediate layer, putting another stack of 64 on top. So we've made stacks of stacks. But that connection between those stacks is highly litho intensive. So it's good for us because it actually means that although as compared to 2D NAND, if you have a greenfield 3D NAND fab, you need 10% more litho. The [ way it's ] -- building stacks on stacks, you need another 15% to 20% extra litho per stack. So that is good for us, and I think we'll just see that. But it's not only the fact that we're stacking stacks. It's also that the specific requirements on lithography tools is different in 3D NAND because you have opaque layers which are very difficult to align layer, 2 layers, so we have specific solutions that we're creating in our dry Deep UV tools, also creating value for our customers. So it all is developing into an area where we are increasingly providing more value to our NAND customers. Going forward, like I said, there are 6 NAND customers for the next 2, 2.5 years that will -- are either in the process of or have just finished or are preparing to build new capacity. And that, of course, will be a big driver, big impetus for our top line sales. And with the introduction of stacks of -- stacks of litho density will increase. On the DRAM, I just said it, I think we just need -- we'll probably see each of those 3 DRAM players from time to time, put up a new facility. I think it's needed. Otherwise, how do we get to 20%, 25% bit growth. So I don't see an issue there either. And again it's, driven by logic. 7-nanometer will be rolled out by -- at least the production tools will be rolled out, end of the year, beginning of 2019 for volume prediction 2020 by our customers. That's happening. It will be EUV. So all in all, it looks pretty solid.\nAnalysts: Okay. Let's switch over to products. I mean, EUV is a good place to start. You've had strong orders in last few quarters. I think there's still a little bit remaining in 2019 capacity to be filled. How should we think about the order intake for the rest of this year in order to basically account for the capacity plan to build for next year? Should we assume you're on track to receive those orders this year?\nExecutives: Yes. I think we've seen some good order intake over the last couple of quarters. I think that will continue throughout the remainder of the year. We have this build capacity of about 30 units for 2019 and 40% to 45% in 2020. That will be, whether we use that full capacity? I think so. That has to do because I think we're confident that the performance targets that our customers are looking at for a widespread introduction of EUV, those performance targets are basically twofold. One has to do with the intrinsic productivity of the machine. We target it, for 2020, a machine that could do 125 wafers per hour and it was based on our ability to create 250 watts of EUV power. We've achieved that at the end of last year, and we're actually rolling this out. And we're seeing now at customer sites, today, 250-watt end customers outputting 125 wafers per hour or more. And why do I say or more, there is an opportunity there that we have indeed created improvements to the EUV source, whereby -- and to the scanner, whereby we get more power on the wafer. So we have now a plan to have 150 wafers per hour as a intrinsic capability of the tool by 2020, which is good because if you can then get that on a continuous basis, then it's more value, it also means a higher priced tool, which is good for the margin also. So that's one. Second to it, that's the productivity. Second is the availability of the tool. This is still an immature tool. It's highly complex technology. We're targeting to have a 92% availability by 2020, which, by the way, we won't stop there. I said earlier in the Deep UV memory space, our availability percentage on 96% to 97%. So there's no fundamental reason why we couldn't get there, the 95%, 96% in the EUV space. We will be after 2020. So our focus is completely on getting to that 92%. We have a target by -- of 88% by the end of the year, which I think is particularly important to our -- for our customers because when you put an EUV tool in your fab, you won't be able to plan on this also, and that's why the availability percentage is, at this moment, is the key focus area because we can basically declare victory on the 125 wafers per hour. And that is just the industrial engineering. It's a lot of tedious work we do, is together with our customers, and we have the fullest confidence that we'll get there by 2020, that we'll have at least 92% availability. So with those 2 parameters in place, then the economics for EUV makes so much sense. And this is why I have no doubt that we'll have the orders to make sure that we can use our capacity. And I think we've made a lot of progress over the last 6 to 12 months on productivity, on availability, some breakthroughs on the collector  degradation, this is the EUV collector, which is in the EUV source that captures the EUV light and beams back into tool. That collector big mirror, that's separate from, you could call it, degradation because the pollution of the tint on the servers, we made some breakthroughs over the last quarter, which gives us the confidence that the 92% should be very realistic by 2020.\nAnalysts: Yes, I mean, so I guess the other part of that, I attended the SPIE Advanced Lithography a couple of month ago. This is obviously an important conference for ASML. Clearly, a lot of progress in the ecosystem. You've already talked about the progress on your side. You think about the other parts of the ecosystem, photoresist, pellicle, so forth, I mean, how do you see that in terms of readiness today and what are the remaining sort of things to tackle, I guess higher transmission pellicles, photoresist sensitivity, how do you see the ecosystem at this point?\nExecutives: I think it's -- what you're seeing is that the suppliers of those solutions, whether it's the membrane that you put in front of the photomask, which are called the pellicle, that pellicle, the first pellicle has a transmission in the 70%. So you're losing very valuable EUV light. That transmission is steadily going up, just a matter of R&D. And the same holds true for the photoresist which is the chemical layer, the photosensitive layer that you put on top off the wafer. That development really started when the suppliers, got a pretty good idea that this too was really working. Now so that's been relatively recent. So you're seeing the R&D work in that space only just starting. And you're seeing quite significant progress on photoresist sensitivity. And that's very important because the more sensitive it as, the more -- the faster you can move the wafer to higher [ indiscernible ] productivity. So it all leads to cost reduction. And I think in those 2 spaces, specifically, pellicle, but also masked preparation and mask inspection and photoresist, there are no road blocks. [ Anyway ], there are development programs that need to bring us to our targets by 2020 when we start to do volume production of 7-nanometer. And if you look at the progress that has been made on those particular parts of the ecosystem, that's been quite impressive. So I have little doubt that by 2020, on those particular parameters for those parts, we will meet the targets.\nAnalysts: Sure. And I agree, there's certainly a lot of progress in the ecosystem. Back to your side, the margins in EUV are still low. How do you see those progressing? What kind of programs does ASML have in place to kind of bring those up, so you can meet your 2020 targets, gross margin targets?\nExecutives: I think the gross margin has been a disappointment for all of us. It has to do that with the fact that we have a significant infrastructure built for EUV and little shipment. So we had a lot of fixed cost. So the biggest driver for margin improvement is the volume. So once we have 4D systems output out of our current capacity, now we have a full load in our factory, which has a significant impact on our gross margin. That's one. Number two is the mix. Like I said earlier, when we're able to give our customers 92% availability with 150 wafers per hour instead of 125, then you also have a higher value, which are higher price of the tool, which of course also adds to the gross margin. Third, it's cost reduction, simply because we're on a learning curve that is not finished yet. So we are reducing cost with our suppliers also. So we have very clear cost targets agreed with our suppliers in the supply chain, which will also reduce the product cost. And fourth, I think is a very important part is service. We have built up a significant service infrastructure to support our customers around the world, not only with people but also with parts and with investments locally and those service costs currently don't have a lot of coverage because we're still in warranty. Now we've agreed with our customers that we don't [ yet ] charge a service cost per wafer. So it's -- and that means that the reason why we want to do it, with our customers are [ amenable ] to this proposal is because, one, it makes their service cost valuable and, two, there is a win-win situation there. Because if we can make our tools so reliable, that the 92% becomes 95%, then they actually produce more wafers out of this critical tool, which is very cost-effective for them and it creates more incentive for us because it gives us more income. And then we look at this, our target is to have per machine per year, about EUR 5 million to EUR 6 million of service revenue. So if you have a hundred tools out there generating service revenue, that's EUR 500 million to EUR 600 million. Now we have an installed base and an infrastructure there that's currently not covered, but will be covered by 2020 when we start seeing that the 2018 shipments will be then serviceable. And this is '19 shipments will be serviceable in 2021. So this will grow pretty quick and will also help the gross margin to our target of 40% in 2020, which of course is just a point in time. I mean, there's no reason why EUV gross margins shouldn't be higher going forward, but that's a matter of time, and like I said, growing the installed base, making sure that we can keep executing on the cost reductions, and I think there's a very clear path forward.\nAnalysts: Just sort of last question in EUV, but you have announced your High-NA tool. Certainly, I guess the starting point of EUV, there's a lot of work on the source. One can imagine the optics might be the challenge here. But what do you see as being the key sort of R&D things to address with High-NA compared to, I guess, your first revisions?\nExecutives: That's a good question. I think the importance of the High-NA [ auras ] for us has really been the fact that it's an acknowledgment of the customer base, some, of our key customers, actually said, EUV is here to stay. And we're going to commit EUR 1.5 billion of our cash, of our money to this R&D development of the next-generation EUV because we need it. We need it for 3-nanometer, we need it for 2-nanometer. I think it is an acknowledgment of the fact that EUV is here to stay. Now what is different there, just to put it into perspective, by the end of this year, Carl Zeiss and ASML have probably invested something like EUR 10 billion into EUV, to bring it to the point where now we can say, we will bring it into volume production. That bill for High-NA will be about half, about [ EUR 5 billion ]. And that shows you that we believe that the R&D effort to bring High-NA to the market will be less than the current. And it has to do with the fact that we don't need to develop a new source. The EUV source has been literally the source of a lot of cost and delay because it had been extremely difficult. Now we are where we are, but that source design will be mature by 2020, 2021, and even more mature when we go into volume production by 2025. And that will be the same source that we will use in the High-NA tool development. Then it's -- really, High-NA is about the new optical system in there which is bigger, which you will then need a bigger scanner with better overlay performance because we keep shrinking the resolution. And then that is where the rest of the R&D money and the CapEx will be spent on. I think it's going to be significant. We're also think that the gross margins that we will see at High-NA will be significantly higher than what we currently see with the introduction of EUV. One reason is we don't need the learning curve of the EUV source, I mentioned that. And secondly, in the development of the optical system, we agreed with Carl Zeiss that we would take 25% in their business unit, that actually is responsible for this optical design and we'll pay the vast majority of the R&D and CapEx. Now how do we get a return on that investment? By basically agreeing with them that we should look at this High-NA business as a 2 companies and 1 business, business plan. And that means that we agreed on an equal internal rate of return for them and for us. However, if we invest the vast majority of the money in absolute terms and also in absolute terms, our return is a lot higher and how do we get that money by the reduction of the lens price. And the reduction of that lens price will of course immediately have an impact on the gross margin. So this is how we managed and scheduled the introduction for the High-NA, which will be around 2025 in volume, first R&D tools, end of 2021, beginning 2022, early volume systems in 2024 and then the volume systems, 2025 [ can build ]. And that will bring us beyond 2030 and that will bring your roadmap to 1.5-nanometer. And that's beyond 2030.\nAnalysts: I guess just on EUV, how it relates to foundry logic. I mean, you're clearly getting the orders in shipping this year. There's been thoughts that maybe Apple wouldn't use it for -- in their X processors until next year. On the other hand, I think that the leading logic player pretty much came out, and said they need EUV for 7, and some questions on the timing there. I guess how should we really think about the production ramp, how it relates to the leading logic, leading foundry. And there's also other foundry players as well, thinking about 7-nanometer. So how should we really think about when the volume production begins and how that ramps.\nExecutives: T\nI think it's clear, it's 7-nanometer, and some different nomenclature here also. This nomenclature of 5, but if -- the way that we look at it, when you look at the effective resolution, we say industry, 7, which then includes this 5-nanometer nomenclature. The industry's 7, which is volume introduction, 2020, by our customers, that only is EUV. And then it depends on the risk appetite of customers, where they say how much layers do we would want to apply on EUV because EUV is a new technology, that ranges from 6 to 7 to over 10 in that area. And that's every logic maker is in that area. There's no plan B. I mean, that's what 2 of them at least told us and said, listen, you know, \"You have to get EUV working for us because at 7-nanometer, we don't have plan B.\" Now it has also been very clear, a statements of our customers, or at 10-nanometer, the issues with very complex multiple patterning has such a dramatic impact on yield that you're almost at the point where you say this is a dead-end street. So we need EUV, there's no doubt about it and that's also the reason why we see the orders currently at 36 orders for EUV in our order book, EUR 4 billion, and that's all being prepared for 7-nanometer.\nAnalysts: Okay. Any questions from the audience? If you do, wait for the mic. We'll keep going then. You mentioned earlier about probably the leading 3, DRAM customers are going to be the first to market with EUV, one would assume 1x, 1y, 1z. What's the timing of the DRAM. And how does that impact also, their even their logic ramp as you consider how they can test EUV in one device, and use it for the other device?\nExecutives: That is probably, if you do both. I mean, you have a DRAM roadmap where you want to use EUV. You have a logic roadmap where you want to use EUV, you have an advantage in the sense that there's learning on both sides. And that's nothing different than what they've been doing in Deep UV also. I think that's why if you have both, you have this particular advantage. Now I think on DRAM EUV, and DRAM is really driven by economics very much. And that has to do with the fact that you can replace some multiple patterning layers with EUV layers. But then you need to show a consistent performance of productivity, which that target has been set at 2,000 wafers per day. You can then calculate that's the raw throughput per hour times 24 hours times the availability. And then you need to multiply that with the tool efficiency. And that's the way that the customers run the tool. And that means that with -- for 2,000 wafers per day, we need to be at 125 wafers per hour and about 88% availability. And that happens to be our target by the end of the year. So when we meet that target, then we meet the 2,000 wafers per day threshold. And that would mean, that would be a very logical time and place for, as a DRAM maker, to start putting EUV into DRAM. And that's then for the upcoming generation. And the generation after that, the number of layers will probably rise from 1 or 2 to 4. But of course DRAM has a lot of wafers, so that is -- there will be -- that's a big driver for EUV sales going forward.\nAnalysts: Okay, I want to switch products. I mean you, obviously, you've acquired HMI, and you have, with that, some new opportunity in your broader Holistic Lithography scheme. There's an inspection aspect and there's more pattern fidelity and, again, sort of tied your Holistic. And then you also have recently started doing mask inspection. So you have a tool in the field, a foundry logic customer, I mean how do you -- do you have additional wins at this point? What is the timing of selection? When is -- I mean, effectively, it's needed now, but realistically, maybe used for future generations. But what are the key performance criteria within the mask inspection business for your program\nExecutives: Well, mask inspection is, when you think about the HMI product portfolio, it's just a nice add-on. That is not what we're focusing on. We're focusing on, wafer inspection. And that with a multi-beam tool. Because we believe that productivity is extremely important because it reduces the cost per wafer. And that's where the focus is, the focus is on a high-productivity multi-beam tool, which will be integrated in the Holistic Lithography architecture of ASML, basically using the data coming out of those measurement points, those control points, using that to refine the model so that we can actually use all the knobs in the scanner to optimize the manufacturing process, which leads to actual yield improvement. So it's a feedback and the feed forward, that is the key focus. And that's just the key focus why we have merged or acquired HMI because their competence, in combination with the computational power and the scanner power of ASML, is pretty unique. And then, the nice add-on is on EUV mask inspection. It's a market which is probably going to be EUR 200 million, EUR 300 million in size. Part of it can be used. Still doubtful, we don't know exactly whether we can use the mask inspection tool fully for what is needed in mask inspection because the face shifts are a bit of an issue. So that needs further investigation and further R&D. But it's a nice add-on. But really, when we need that mask inspection is when 7-nanometer goes into volume production, which we said it was 2020. And so all in all, we're very happy with the HMI acquisition and the integration. The integration is being focused on product and product integration and new product development. This patent fidelity tool that we have shipped at the end of last year first is really the linking pin in that Holistic feedback and feedforward strategy that we're having. And the first feedback from the customer is very positive. Now, then we need to complement that with a high-speed multi-beam tool, which is not only a multi-beam column, but you can imagine you have to move the wafer stage very fast, so you have fast wafer stages, which happens to be one of our core competence. And this is where you see, I would say, amalgamation of the HMI and the ASML specific product technology into a new product which is pretty unique. So we're very excited there, and our target is to grow this combined ASML, HMI business to EUR 1 billion by 2020, which was the reason why we upped our initial EUR 10 billion target for 2020 with another EUR 1 billion to EUR 11 billion, and we're pretty confident that we're going to get there.\nAnalysts: Okay, I guess the last question, and related to your 2020, you talked about R&D as a percentage of revenue around 13%. Your current run rate is actually higher than that. So should we assume that R&D will normalize to that level as we approach that target?\nExecutives: I think I would stick to the 17% OpEx, which is 13% R&D, 4% SG&A, also by 2020, which if people do the math, could indicate and say, well you're pooling in some of the R&D for High-NA, because that now needs to be pooled in 2 or 3 years, so that R&D will be higher, then you can also deduce that the EUR 11 billion for us is not a very difficult target by 2020. It's probably going to be a bit higher.\nAnalysts: Okay. With that, we're out of time. Thanks again, Peter.\nExecutives: Thank you very much, Bill.\nAnalysts: Thanks.\nAnalysts: Okay, good morning, everyone. My name is Bill Peterson, I work on the U.S. Semiconductor Equipment Research team. We have here today is, well, Peter Wennink, the CEO of ASML. I'm doing a fireside chat, on behalf of my colleague, Sandeep, who is based in London. \nPeter is going to give some opening comments about ASML, and then we'll move to Q&A and then I'll open it up later on. But it's certainly a pleasure to have you here, Peter. Thanks a lot for coming.\nExecutives: Okay, Bill, thanks. Yes, I think perhaps good to basically give you a couple of minutes of comments as a result of the 1.5 days that we've been spending here in Boston and talking about our business, our industry. And I'd like to start off with one of -- there's a lot of questions that we've got over the last 1.5 days, it was about -- were about the cycle. And that's quite interesting because some people said, well, do we still have a cycle? And I think the following is basically where we are. And I think the industry has significantly consolidated over the last 10 years. So you will always have, in this industry, pockets in time where when you look at our business and our customer base, logic, DRAM and NAND, within those segments, there are only a few players left. And when those players all decide to basically put -- a capacity of those would be mega fabs, some of them costing more than $10 billion each, you will have a step-up in capacity. So that is unavoidable. I don't think it's very bad. If you look, for instance, in 3D NAND, the CAGR there is 45%. So yes, if you put up as extra capacity in the step-up function, it will grow into it quite rapidly also. \nNow when we talk about the industry, I think the most important thing that we need to remind ourselves, obviously, is that this industry is very much driven by what happens in logic. Why? Because the logic fuels the compute power that is needed in all those areas that we're currently so excited about, whether it's artificial intelligence, Big Data, it's the cloud or it's self-driving cars, it's crypto mining, it doesn't matter. I mean, it's all about high-power compute. And high-power compute is driven by the ability of our customers to keep shrinking. And effectively saying, the roadmap of that particular shrink, which is now at 10 nanometer, again our customers effectively bring it down to 7, 5, 3, 2, 1.5, which would bring us beyond 2030. \nI think the answer to that is yes, I think we can do that. And that means that given the wide array of applications that we're currently seeing, that can be -- that actually use the compute power, which is so much more applications, and the application space is so much more wider than 5 or 10 years ago, that -- the industry is then, once they get to a 7-nanometer node, the speed with which it will ramp up a certain level of capacity is also higher. That's what we're seeing today. And that's actually fueled our business over the next -- over the last 3 years and for the next couple of years. The ramp-up speed of the new technology is very high, and it has been very high, and logic has been our most prominent part of our business for the last 3 years. And I think it will be for the next couple of years. \nNow let me start with logic. You have high-power compute capability. There's this siamese twin that is tied to logic, which is called high-performance memory, which is DRAM. So when you have a relatively fast growing ramp-up of new technology and the roadmap can be executed because of EUV, then we also need high-performance bits. And the last 2 years and also this year, we estimate a 25% bit growth in DRAM this year. \nNow something has happened in the DRAM space over the last couple of years and going forward, and that's that there's the one area, the one segment of the industry where Moore's Law is slowing down. You see the innovations are going from a node-to-node time of 2 years to 4 years, which effectively means that every year, we won't be able to add like we did in the past because of technology transitions, 15% to 20% bits, just because of technology transitions. It's more like 10% to 15%. Now if your DRAM demand, which is very tightly tied to the rollout of your logic roadmap, if that requires 25% bit growth, and you can only get 10%, 15% max, probably closer to 10% through the technology transitions. And how do you get that extra -- those extra bits? By wafers. You have to put extra wafers. \nNow this is actually -- that didn't happen over the last 2 years, which is the reason why DRAM pressure showed up. It's very simple. It's a supply-and-demand equation. Now DRAM wafer capacity installed base actually didn't grow. As a matter of fact, it went down because over the last couple of years, some of those DRAM tools went into the 3D NAND space. Now how were our customers able then to still deliver 25%, albeit that the prices went up? It's because the productivity in those fabs went up quite significantly. When we look at the wafer-per-day records that we saw 2 years ago on our tools, it was about 4,500 wafers. Now we're now closing into 6,000 wafers per day. \nSo just cranking out more wafers has been the solution. And that means that in some DRAM fabs, you had 97% availability constantly. Now you cannot be at 100% because you need some overhead. So what is the availability of our customers to keep getting more wafers out? That is limited. So we need to build fabs. \nAnd this is what's actually happening. I mean, one of our customers is -- has emptied a particular fab where that production went to a 3D NAND new development, and that open space is now being filled with DRAM tools and luckily so. \nNow we've looked going forward, and we see this development of logic, 7-nanometer, 5-nanometer, 3, in an application space that is growing. That means that the ramp-up speed of the new technology will be high, we need high-performance DRAM. So in our mind, there's actually a need for more DRAM wafers. We don't see this as a kind of a build-up bubble coming.\nAnd, then, that is DRAM. On the 3D NAND, which is storage, now clearly 45% CAGR is very nice and it's good. But you see more players in this space. I mean, where we have 3 major players in DRAM, we have 6 in 3D NAND, and as over a timeframe of 2, 2.5 years, we see all these 6 players putting new capacity in place. That's not all at the same time. It's also not a very homogeneous group of customers. You have start-up customers in China and you have very mature customers in Korea. And they all -- but they're all planning for a capacity expansion. That will happen over a relatively long period 2, 2.5 years. So you will see from time to time these pockets of extra capacity coming up, which will probably drive the price weakness. It's a pretty price-elastic market, but that's normal. And with the CAGR of 45%, I think that we'll grow into that -- into those pockets of extra capacity relatively quick. \nSo all in all, long introduction, sorry for that, sorry for that Bill. I know you have a lot of questions, so there won't be a lot of time left. But this is where we are. And it's not only where we are today, I think this is where the industry will be for the next couple of years. And again, critical here is will the industry, and we're a partner in that industry, will that industry be able to keep following the roadmap and execute that roadmap in a cost-effective manner, and we believe that we will be able to do so.\nAnalysts: Okay. Great, thanks for that. And we have some questions on the end market, and you've kind of addressed a lot of that. But I guess maybe just specific to memory. I think you've said in the past that you have a pretty good feel for DRAM capacity. So at least it sounds like you don't really see the imminent over signs of supply. NAND, you've kind of commented you have less visibility, but I think you do have a visibility to whether or not they're either going to be stacked or not. So I know an order has been strong in NAND, but I guess sort of a two-part question. First on NAND is, how do you see the requirements for litho for next-generation 3D NAND evolving? And then, really, for DRAM, I guess, obviously, spending has been high this year. How do you see that sort of trending over, say, the next 6 to 12 months?\nExecutives: Yes. I think, like I said earlier, 3 segments: logic DRAM and NAND. I think only in DRAM we see a slowing of Moore's Law, we don't see it in logic and we don't see it in NAND. I mean, the bit density increase is basically managed through stacking more layers, basically creating more layers on top of each other. Ultimately, we've seen our roadmaps where customers are looking at a 92 layers for 3D NAND. Now but out of the 92 layers, you don't build them on top of each other. It's very clear that our customers are now talking about creating a stack of, let's say, 64 layers and then creating an intermediate layer and then put another stack of 64 on top, creating an intermediate layer, putting another stack of 64 on top. So we've made stacks of stacks. But that connection between those stacks is highly litho intensive. So it's good for us because it actually means that although as compared to 2D NAND, if you have a greenfield 3D NAND fab, you need 10% more litho. The [ way it's ] -- building stacks on stacks, you need another 15% to 20% extra litho per stack. So that is good for us, and I think we'll just see that. But it's not only the fact that we're stacking stacks. It's also that the specific requirements on lithography tools is different in 3D NAND because you have opaque layers which are very difficult to align layer, 2 layers, so we have specific solutions that we're creating in our dry Deep UV tools, also creating value for our customers. So it all is developing into an area where we are increasingly providing more value to our NAND customers. Going forward, like I said, there are 6 NAND customers for the next 2, 2.5 years that will -- are either in the process of or have just finished or are preparing to build new capacity. And that, of course, will be a big driver, big impetus for our top line sales. And with the introduction of stacks of -- stacks of litho density will increase. On the DRAM, I just said it, I think we just need -- we'll probably see each of those 3 DRAM players from time to time, put up a new facility. I think it's needed. Otherwise, how do we get to 20%, 25% bit growth. So I don't see an issue there either. And again it's, driven by logic. 7-nanometer will be rolled out by -- at least the production tools will be rolled out, end of the year, beginning of 2019 for volume prediction 2020 by our customers. That's happening. It will be EUV. So all in all, it looks pretty solid.\nAnalysts: Okay. Let's switch over to products. I mean, EUV is a good place to start. You've had strong orders in last few quarters. I think there's still a little bit remaining in 2019 capacity to be filled. How should we think about the order intake for the rest of this year in order to basically account for the capacity plan to build for next year? Should we assume you're on track to receive those orders this year?\nExecutives: Yes. I think we've seen some good order intake over the last couple of quarters. I think that will continue throughout the remainder of the year. We have this build capacity of about 30 units for 2019 and 40% to 45% in 2020. That will be, whether we use that full capacity? I think so. That has to do because I think we're confident that the performance targets that our customers are looking at for a widespread introduction of EUV, those performance targets are basically twofold. One has to do with the intrinsic productivity of the machine. We target it, for 2020, a machine that could do 125 wafers per hour and it was based on our ability to create 250 watts of EUV power. We've achieved that at the end of last year, and we're actually rolling this out. And we're seeing now at customer sites, today, 250-watt end customers outputting 125 wafers per hour or more. And why do I say or more, there is an opportunity there that we have indeed created improvements to the EUV source, whereby -- and to the scanner, whereby we get more power on the wafer. So we have now a plan to have 150 wafers per hour as a intrinsic capability of the tool by 2020, which is good because if you can then get that on a continuous basis, then it's more value, it also means a higher priced tool, which is good for the margin also. So that's one. Second to it, that's the productivity. Second is the availability of the tool. This is still an immature tool. It's highly complex technology. We're targeting to have a 92% availability by 2020, which, by the way, we won't stop there. I said earlier in the Deep UV memory space, our availability percentage on 96% to 97%. So there's no fundamental reason why we couldn't get there, the 95%, 96% in the EUV space. We will be after 2020. So our focus is completely on getting to that 92%. We have a target by -- of 88% by the end of the year, which I think is particularly important to our -- for our customers because when you put an EUV tool in your fab, you won't be able to plan on this also, and that's why the availability percentage is, at this moment, is the key focus area because we can basically declare victory on the 125 wafers per hour. And that is just the industrial engineering. It's a lot of tedious work we do, is together with our customers, and we have the fullest confidence that we'll get there by 2020, that we'll have at least 92% availability. So with those 2 parameters in place, then the economics for EUV makes so much sense. And this is why I have no doubt that we'll have the orders to make sure that we can use our capacity. And I think we've made a lot of progress over the last 6 to 12 months on productivity, on availability, some breakthroughs on the collector  degradation, this is the EUV collector, which is in the EUV source that captures the EUV light and beams back into tool. That collector big mirror, that's separate from, you could call it, degradation because the pollution of the tint on the servers, we made some breakthroughs over the last quarter, which gives us the confidence that the 92% should be very realistic by 2020.\nAnalysts: Yes, I mean, so I guess the other part of that, I attended the SPIE Advanced Lithography a couple of month ago. This is obviously an important conference for ASML. Clearly, a lot of progress in the ecosystem. You've already talked about the progress on your side. You think about the other parts of the ecosystem, photoresist, pellicle, so forth, I mean, how do you see that in terms of readiness today and what are the remaining sort of things to tackle, I guess higher transmission pellicles, photoresist sensitivity, how do you see the ecosystem at this point?\nExecutives: I think it's -- what you're seeing is that the suppliers of those solutions, whether it's the membrane that you put in front of the photomask, which are called the pellicle, that pellicle, the first pellicle has a transmission in the 70%. So you're losing very valuable EUV light. That transmission is steadily going up, just a matter of R&D. And the same holds true for the photoresist which is the chemical layer, the photosensitive layer that you put on top off the wafer. That development really started when the suppliers, got a pretty good idea that this too was really working. Now so that's been relatively recent. So you're seeing the R&D work in that space only just starting. And you're seeing quite significant progress on photoresist sensitivity. And that's very important because the more sensitive it as, the more -- the faster you can move the wafer to higher [ indiscernible ] productivity. So it all leads to cost reduction. And I think in those 2 spaces, specifically, pellicle, but also masked preparation and mask inspection and photoresist, there are no road blocks. [ Anyway ], there are development programs that need to bring us to our targets by 2020 when we start to do volume production of 7-nanometer. And if you look at the progress that has been made on those particular parts of the ecosystem, that's been quite impressive. So I have little doubt that by 2020, on those particular parameters for those parts, we will meet the targets.\nAnalysts: Sure. And I agree, there's certainly a lot of progress in the ecosystem. Back to your side, the margins in EUV are still low. How do you see those progressing? What kind of programs does ASML have in place to kind of bring those up, so you can meet your 2020 targets, gross margin targets?\nExecutives: I think the gross margin has been a disappointment for all of us. It has to do that with the fact that we have a significant infrastructure built for EUV and little shipment. So we had a lot of fixed cost. So the biggest driver for margin improvement is the volume. So once we have 4D systems output out of our current capacity, now we have a full load in our factory, which has a significant impact on our gross margin. That's one. Number two is the mix. Like I said earlier, when we're able to give our customers 92% availability with 150 wafers per hour instead of 125, then you also have a higher value, which are higher price of the tool, which of course also adds to the gross margin. Third, it's cost reduction, simply because we're on a learning curve that is not finished yet. So we are reducing cost with our suppliers also. So we have very clear cost targets agreed with our suppliers in the supply chain, which will also reduce the product cost. And fourth, I think is a very important part is service. We have built up a significant service infrastructure to support our customers around the world, not only with people but also with parts and with investments locally and those service costs currently don't have a lot of coverage because we're still in warranty. Now we've agreed with our customers that we don't [ yet ] charge a service cost per wafer. So it's -- and that means that the reason why we want to do it, with our customers are [ amenable ] to this proposal is because, one, it makes their service cost valuable and, two, there is a win-win situation there. Because if we can make our tools so reliable, that the 92% becomes 95%, then they actually produce more wafers out of this critical tool, which is very cost-effective for them and it creates more incentive for us because it gives us more income. And then we look at this, our target is to have per machine per year, about EUR 5 million to EUR 6 million of service revenue. So if you have a hundred tools out there generating service revenue, that's EUR 500 million to EUR 600 million. Now we have an installed base and an infrastructure there that's currently not covered, but will be covered by 2020 when we start seeing that the 2018 shipments will be then serviceable. And this is '19 shipments will be serviceable in 2021. So this will grow pretty quick and will also help the gross margin to our target of 40% in 2020, which of course is just a point in time. I mean, there's no reason why EUV gross margins shouldn't be higher going forward, but that's a matter of time, and like I said, growing the installed base, making sure that we can keep executing on the cost reductions, and I think there's a very clear path forward.\nAnalysts: Just sort of last question in EUV, but you have announced your High-NA tool. Certainly, I guess the starting point of EUV, there's a lot of work on the source. One can imagine the optics might be the challenge here. But what do you see as being the key sort of R&D things to address with High-NA compared to, I guess, your first revisions?\nExecutives: That's a good question. I think the importance of the High-NA [ auras ] for us has really been the fact that it's an acknowledgment of the customer base, some, of our key customers, actually said, EUV is here to stay. And we're going to commit EUR 1.5 billion of our cash, of our money to this R&D development of the next-generation EUV because we need it. We need it for 3-nanometer, we need it for 2-nanometer. I think it is an acknowledgment of the fact that EUV is here to stay. Now what is different there, just to put it into perspective, by the end of this year, Carl Zeiss and ASML have probably invested something like EUR 10 billion into EUV, to bring it to the point where now we can say, we will bring it into volume production. That bill for High-NA will be about half, about [ EUR 5 billion ]. And that shows you that we believe that the R&D effort to bring High-NA to the market will be less than the current. And it has to do with the fact that we don't need to develop a new source. The EUV source has been literally the source of a lot of cost and delay because it had been extremely difficult. Now we are where we are, but that source design will be mature by 2020, 2021, and even more mature when we go into volume production by 2025. And that will be the same source that we will use in the High-NA tool development. Then it's -- really, High-NA is about the new optical system in there which is bigger, which you will then need a bigger scanner with better overlay performance because we keep shrinking the resolution. And then that is where the rest of the R&D money and the CapEx will be spent on. I think it's going to be significant. We also think that the gross margins that we will see at High-NA will be significantly higher than what we currently see with the introduction of EUV. One reason is we don't need the learning curve of the EUV source, I mentioned that. And secondly, in the development of the optical system, we agreed with Carl Zeiss that we would take 25% in their business unit, that actually is responsible for this optical design and we'll pay the vast majority of the R&D and CapEx. Now how do we get a return on that investment? By basically agreeing with them that we should look at this High-NA business as a 2 companies and 1 business, business plan. And that means that we agreed on an equal internal rate of return for them and for us. However, if we invest the vast majority of the money in absolute terms and also in absolute terms, our return is a lot higher and how do we get that money by the reduction of the lens price. And the reduction of that lens price will of course immediately have an impact on the gross margin. So this is how we managed and scheduled the introduction for the High-NA, which will be around 2025 in volume, first R&D tools, end of 2021, beginning 2022, early volume systems in 2024 and then the volume systems, 2025 [ can build ]. And that will bring us beyond 2030 and that will bring your roadmap to 1.5-nanometer. And that's beyond 2030.\nAnalysts: I guess just on EUV, how it relates to foundry logic. I mean, you're clearly getting the orders in shipping this year. There's been thoughts that maybe Apple wouldn't use it for -- in their X processors until next year. On the other hand, I think that the leading logic player pretty much came out, and said they need EUV for 7, and some questions on the timing there. I guess how should we really think about the production ramp, how it relates to the leading logic, leading foundry. And there's also other foundry players as well, thinking about 7-nanometer. So how should we really think about when the volume production begins and how that ramps.\nExecutives: T\nI think it's clear, it's 7-nanometer, and some different nomenclature here also. This nomenclature of 5, but if -- the way that we look at it, when you look at the effective resolution, we say industry, 7, which then includes this 5-nanometer nomenclature. The industry's 7, which is volume introduction, 2020, by our customers, that only is EUV. And then it depends on the risk appetite of customers, where they say how much layers do we would want to apply on EUV because EUV is a new technology, that ranges from 6 to 7 to over 10 in that area. And that's every logic maker is in that area. There's no plan B. I mean, that's what 2 of them at least told us and said, listen, you know, \"You have to get EUV working for us because at 7-nanometer, we don't have plan B.\" Now it has also been very clear, a statements of our customers, or at 10-nanometer, the issues with very complex multiple patterning has such a dramatic impact on yield that you're almost at the point where you say this is a dead-end street. So we need EUV, there's no doubt about it and that's also the reason why we see the orders currently at 36 orders for EUV in our order book, EUR 4 billion, and that's all being prepared for 7-nanometer.\nAnalysts: Okay. Any questions from the audience? If you do, wait for the mic. We'll keep going then. You mentioned earlier about probably the leading 3, DRAM customers are going to be the first to market with EUV, one would assume 1x, 1y, 1z. What's the timing of the DRAM. And how does that impact also, their even their logic ramp as you consider how they can test EUV in one device, and use it for the other device?\nExecutives: That is probably, if you do both. I mean, you have a DRAM roadmap where you want to use EUV. You have a logic roadmap where you want to use EUV, you have an advantage in the sense that there's learning on both sides. And that's nothing different than what they've been doing in Deep UV also. I think that's why if you have both, you have this particular advantage. Now I think on DRAM EUV, and DRAM is really driven by economics very much. And that has to do with the fact that you can replace some multiple patterning layers with EUV layers. But then you need to show a consistent performance of productivity, which that target has been set at 2,000 wafers per day. You can then calculate that's the raw throughput per hour times 24 hours times the availability. And then you need to multiply that with the tool efficiency. And that's the way that the customers run the tool. And that means that with -- for 2,000 wafers per day, we need to be at 125 wafers per hour and about 88% availability. And that happens to be our target by the end of the year. So when we meet that target, then we meet the 2,000 wafers per day threshold. And that would mean, that would be a very logical time and place for, as a DRAM maker, to start putting EUV into DRAM. And that's then for the upcoming generation. And the generation after that, the number of layers will probably rise from 1 or 2 to 4. But of course DRAM has a lot of wafers, so that is -- there will be -- that's a big driver for EUV sales going forward.\nAnalysts: Okay, I want to switch products. I mean you, obviously, you've acquired HMI, and you have, with that, some new opportunity in your broader Holistic Lithography scheme. There's an inspection aspect and there's more pattern fidelity and, again, sort of tied your Holistic. And then you also have recently started doing mask inspection. So you have a tool in the field, a foundry logic customer, I mean how do you -- do you have additional wins at this point? What is the timing of selection? When is -- I mean, effectively, it's needed now, but realistically, maybe used for future generations. But what are the key performance criteria within the mask inspection business for your program\nExecutives: Well, mask inspection is, when you think about the HMI product portfolio, it's just a nice add-on. That is not what we're focusing on. We're focusing on, wafer inspection. And that with a multi-beam tool. Because we believe that productivity is extremely important because it reduces the cost per wafer. And that's where the focus is, the focus is on a high-productivity multi-beam tool, which will be integrated in the Holistic Lithography architecture of ASML, basically using the data coming out of those measurement points, those control points, using that to refine the model so that we can actually use all the knobs in the scanner to optimize the manufacturing process, which leads to actual yield improvement. So it's a feedback and the feed forward, that is the key focus. And that's just the key focus why we have merged or acquired HMI because their competence, in combination with the computational power and the scanner power of ASML, is pretty unique. And then, the nice add-on is on EUV mask inspection. It's a market which is probably going to be EUR 200 million, EUR 300 million in size. Part of it can be used. Still doubtful, we don't know exactly whether we can use the mask inspection tool fully for what is needed in mask inspection because the face shifts are a bit of an issue. So that needs further investigation and further R&D. But it's a nice add-on. But really, when we need that mask inspection is when 7-nanometer goes into volume production, which we said it was 2020. And so all in all, we're very happy with the HMI acquisition and the integration. The integration is being focused on product and product integration and new product development. This patent fidelity tool that we have shipped at the end of last year first is really the linking pin in that Holistic feedback and feedforward strategy that we're having. And the first feedback from the customer is very positive. Now, then we need to complement that with a high-speed multi-beam tool, which is not only a multi-beam column, but you can imagine you have to move the wafer stage very fast, so you have fast wafer stages, which happens to be one of our core competence. And this is where you see, I would say, amalgamation of the HMI and the ASML specific product technology into a new product which is pretty unique. So we're very excited there, and our target is to grow this combined ASML, HMI business to EUR 1 billion by 2020, which was the reason why we upped our initial EUR 10 billion target for 2020 with another EUR 1 billion to EUR 11 billion, and we're pretty confident that we're going to get there.\nAnalysts: Okay, I guess the last question, and related to your 2020, you talked about R&D as a percentage of revenue around 13%. Your current run rate is actually higher than that. So should we assume that R&D will normalize to that level as we approach that target?\nExecutives: I think I would stick to the 17% OpEx, which is 13% R&D, 4% SG&A, also by 2020, which if people do the math, could indicate and say, well you're pooling in some of the R&D for High-NA, because that now needs to be pooled in 2 or 3 years, so that R&D will be higher, then you can also deduce that the EUR 11 billion for us is not a very difficult target by 2020. It's probably going to be a bit higher.\nAnalysts: Okay. With that, we're out of time. Thanks again, Peter.\nExecutives: Thank you very much, Bill.\nAnalysts: Thanks."
