         "Attendees: Now if there's a company that understands these changes, including machine learning and big data, as well as open source and collaboration, it's Google. You saw one of Google's open source projects, TensorFlow, in today's demo. Just a few minutes, Google Chief Decision Scientist will be here. But before she gives you more information about what intelligent apps will really look like, we'll hear from a shared customer, Kohl's, about their journey with Red Hat and Google. So please welcome Ritch from Kohl's and Cassie from Google.\nAttendees: All right. Most of you know Kohl's as a chain of leading American department stores, but you might not know that there's also been a long-time customer of Red Hat. Ritch, could you tell a little bit about Kohl's and your relationship with us?\nAttendees: Sure thing. So first of all, it's great to be here. I was really looking forward to summit this year, and then I saw Weezer was playing, and that put me right over the top, icing on the cake, so looking forward to that. So Kohl's, we're department store, almost 1,200 stores, 49 states, about $19 billion in revenue. We've got about 1,000 person IT shop, another 2,500 people in managed services around the globe. So big, big technology footprint. We're based in Wisconsin outside Milwaukee, but we also have a tech center here in Silicon Valley, in Milpitas. So long time Red Hat customer. When I got to Kohl's about 8 years ago, there was a small pocket in the data center running RHEL. And it was a distant third out of 3 operating systems at Kohl's. And I look today years later, RHEL is the predominant operating system, and we've just signed on for OpenShift as our PaaS platform and our hybrid cloud effort. We have efforts underway around Gluster, ActiveMQ. We have a relentless automation effort, Ansible plays a big part there. So we are very excited about our future with Red Hat. We've had a good history. The future looks even brighter. It's a big part of our digital transformation.\nExecutives: So we at Google are thrilled to be in this journey with you. Can you tell us a little bit more about why you picked Google as a partner?\nAttendees: Yes. So as we embarked on our hybrid cloud journey, we felt it was important to pick a primary public cloud provider. One cloud provider -- even though multi-cloud's inevitable, we felt 1 primary was the right approach where you would go very deep and understand that platform, all the nuances, how to optimize your workloads to run cost-effectively, how to use networking, all the details and we chose Google, and there's really a few reasons for that. One is we're an existing customer. We use G Suites, adds, but more importantly, there were a few things. One, engineering. We think Google's engineering is really top-notch. And as we did our reference calls, time and time again, we heard that not only is the engineering great, but you have access to the engineering resources. So we felt that was really important. Two, Google, it was really interesting. They said, \"hey, yes, there's GCPD L is great, I appreciate that. But what do you want to do together? Like, what problems do you want to solve and retail?\" And we found that pretty interesting. But I think lastly, the tiebreaker, a lot of great cloud offerings out there, was machine learning. We believe that, like all of you probably, that's the next big unlock in our industry, and we felt that really Google is really the leader in that space and that's where we want to hit our wagon.\nExecutives: That's a topic really close to my heart, and I'm so glad that you've chosen us. Thank you.\nAttendees: So Ritch, you've been moving really quickly and even ahead of many of your peers. So it sounds like Red Hat and Google have both played a role in that. What do we offer both -- what do we both offer together that you don't get elsewhere?\nAttendees: Sure. So I would say that as I've gone through my career, one of the things I've gotten a much greater appreciation for is the value of partnerships. I would say earlier in my career, and then probably spent a lot of energy on that. But having gone through really good partnerships and other partnerships that weren't so good, it can take years, if not a decade, to unwind from some of those decisions that you make, right? So I think the secret is this. The secrets to understand what your values are as a company and then go find partners that align to those values, okay? So with us, it's pretty simple. We're very engineering-led organization, and we feel that you guys both align really nicely to that. Secondly, we're very committed to a future of open source, okay? Not only just open source, but enterprise-grade open source, right, that we can run our business on. So we felt that with the future being so uncertain, we don't know where all this is going 5 years from now. So what you need to do is find a partner that has the right stuff in their DNA so that as new products are announced and new acquisitions are made, you know they're going to continue on that path of engineering-centric and a commitment to open source. So to us, that's really what it's about, that's why we're thrilled to partner with these 2 companies and looking forward to a great future.\nAttendees: Well, thanks a lot. I love hearing the kind of open source collaboration is what really brings this partnership to the forefront. So we'll turn it over to Cassie. Thank you.\nExecutives: So how many of you have that moment where you realized everyone is using some word and you have no idea what that means but you're too afraid to ask at this point. What even is machine learning? Well, it's an approach to making lots of small decisions like data something involving algorithmically finding patterns in data. But let me just put it bluntly so that we can all get it. It's a thing labeler essentially, that's what machine learning is. It's just a thing labeler. So why on earth should you be excited about thing labeling? Well, here's my pet Huxley, and you've just taken in some pretty complicated data through your senses and you just know that that's a cat. And if I show you a different image, you're not fooled, you still know that that label is cat. Your brain just does this, you don't even know how your brain does it. Now if we want to get a computer to perform this labeling task for us, if we went the traditional way, you know this, programmers, we would communicate with the universe in some way, think really deeply about the problem and come up with a model. It's a model, it's just a recipe. It's a set of instructions that a computer has to follow to get from the image to the label. And we would have to hand craft that. Now think about what this recipe would have to be for the computer to correctly detect that there's a cat in the image. I mean, think about what you, your brain actually did with those pixels? Can you express that? Do you know what your brain is doing? Or have you just had the benefit of eons of evolution and it just kind of figures it out for you? Now that recipe is really hard to handcraft. Wouldn't it be better if you could just say to the machine, here, \"look at a bunch of examples of cats, look at a bunch of examples of not cats and just figure it out yourself.\" That is what machine learning is all about. It is a completely different programming paradigm. Now instead of giving explicit instructions, you program with examples, with data and let that machine learning algorithm figure it out and stitch that code that goes in between for you. So why should you actually be excited by this thing labeling? Well, engineers, you know we like to get computers to do stuff for us, and there's a whole class of tasks where we just cannot express the instructions. They're ineffable. AI and machine learning are about automating the ineffable. This is a fundamental leap in human progress. Now you can get computers to do tasks where you cannot possibly express the instructions. This is so exciting and seems futuristic and difficult, right? And when you think about machine learning, the one thing I most want you to think about is microwaves. Who here in the audience knows how a microwave oven works well enough to build a new one from scratch, raise hands? Who can build a new one? do you see any takers, any takers? No hands? Yes, me neither. Who here has never used want to reheat food? You all have. Even though you have no idea how it works, you're still happy to use one, right? And anyone here feel like you what have no idea how to get hold of on, I don't know, like maybe add Kohl's, if you needed one? Now you just told me you have no idea how it works so how could you possibly trust this microwave? Well, you're not going to trust it by reading the wiring diagram, are you? You're going to trust it by taking that it actually does work, by having a good idea that it wanted to do for you and then tasting what comes out on the other side. And that is exactly what you'll do with machine learning, and this is a perfect analogy for machine learning. Now what they don't tell you about machine learning, when we use that term, especially to machine learnings, not 1. 2 completely different disciplines that are as different as building microwaves from scratch and innovating in the kitchen. And you need completely different skill sets for this. If you want to be a machine learning researcher, you are building general-purpose tools for other people to use. And so the bad news there is that there is quite a lot of education that you need to get, it takes a little while to ramp up because how on earth are you going to build a better microwave than the one that exists already, there's some pretty sophisticated stuff out there, if you have no idea how the current 1 works. So that's the bad news. It takes a long want to become a machine learning researcher. The good news though is that if that is your cup of tea, we at Google, have a large machine learning research shop where we make these tools for you that are all powered by open source, so we give you those wiring diagrams as a springboard so that you can go and build a better microwave than what we have using our blueprints. And TensorFlow, a really popular machine learning project, started at Google before we open sourced it because we believe that the community as a whole so much more innovative other than just anyone of us alone. But let's face it, most if you are not here to build general-purpose microwaves. You just want to get cooking already, right? You just want to use these things to solve business problems, and so you are in the completely other discipline, applied machine learning. Now for that, you do not need a PhD. You don't need to know how back propagation works and neural networks any more than a chef needs to know how a microwave is wired. Instead, what you need is a really good kitchen to play in, and we, at Google, provide that for you. Let me show you some of the things that we have. And what you're going to need kind of depends on what you're cooking. If you're cooking with the usual ingredients data and you're making usual dishes, labels, predictions, so say you're making pizza, please don't reinvent the concept of pizza from scratch. There's already recipes out there, and nyou can just grab those recipes and start making pizza, and that is what our cloud APIs are all about. These are recipes that we've already built that you can just pick up and start using. You can just plug them into your apps to make those intelligent applications. But say you're cooking with a little twist. Now it's gluten-free vegan pizza. Well, you still don't need to -- you still don't need to start entirely from scratch. It's still pizza. You can just adjust what already exists out there. And so what we suggest for you here is try cloud auto ML. Sure, maybe we haven't trained our vision system on the clothing type that your Kohl's customers are wearing, but no problem, just feed in your images with your labels and to cloud auto ML, and you'll be good to go with a small adjustment necessary. Now say you're truly innovating. You have your own completely unique ingredients. You're doing something pretty different in the kitchen. I don't know, maybe now you're making an edible sock that taste like pizza. Well, machine learning and innovation are in Google's core DNA. In fact, I can't think of a single one of our consumer products that doesn't have machine learning and it somewhere. And so if you are innovating in the kitchen, if you're building truly new recipes, what we have for you is cloud machine learning engine. This is access to exactly the same infrastructure that Google uses to train our models, incredible. So you could, if you wanted to, after this session, grab a laptop, open it up and test drive our shiny gleaming kitchen with all those appliances ready to go, and you could feel the thrill of the data center and all this cutting-edge algorithms rising up to do your bidding. So solving business problems with machine learning, applied machine learning is a far easier than what most people think. But you don't realize this that all those courses in university, those are all about how to build the microwave. Not just how to use it to get cooking. And when I hear people say \"oh, I couldn't possibly get started with machine learning until I take a course in it or, goodness, it will degree,\" I couldn't help but imagine that same person saying I couldn't possibly use a microwave until I built 1 myself. You can just get cooking. It's not the lack of degree or course or knowledge that's holding you back. What's much, much more important than that, what you need to get started is creativity. Figure out what you're going to cook because all those tools are already there waiting for you to use them. Imagine gleaming kitchens just waiting for you to come play in them. But since this is a thing labeler, you need to start thinking by what on earth do you want labeled and see how creative you can get with that. You might imagine the label being maybe the way or form of that sounds like a voice that could make a hairdressers appointment for you, or you can imagine a few other cases like maybe you are a loving son and your aging parents sort vegetables by hand and you want to save them the trouble of having to do that on their farm so maybe you're thinking about building a system that will label the vegetables and sort it automatically so your parents don't have to do it, or maybe you're worried about the ingredients that go into baby food. And you think it would be great if you could automatically check whether the ingredient is safe or spoiled before it goes in or maybe you're into the idea of a huge bank with trillions of dollars in assets, countering fraud and money laundering automatically across millions of accounts. If you imagine that world, you imagined this world. Well, these are all real examples of things that have been done on Google Cloud platform. The first is a real family of cucumber farmers. The second is a Japanese manufacturer of high-quality baby food product, Kewpie; and the third is HSBC who uses Google Cloud to run a better business and catch the bad guys across 27 million customers. Pretty different chefs, completely different applications, why is Google Cloud platform the right choice for all of them? Well, think about what you might want in a kitchen. You'd want good engineering so you probably want to think about getting a partner whose quality you trust. But think more long term than that. If you believe in your own infinite creativity, if you believe in the future, you would be crazy to let yourself get locked into a kitchen where the [indiscernible] sets it one time for you and then controls what you can and can't have in there. And every appliance has its own proprietary little socket that you are not allowed to tamper with. And if your business changes, then you have to rebuild and beware the whole thing. Imagine instead the dream kitchen that becomes what you needed to be instantly. Complete universal wiring, open interfaces, the best of everything, all the modern appliances always available, and you can plug them in with no fuss because that wiring is universal. That, my friends, is the power of open source, and that is what Google and Red Hat, together believe in. We don't want to see your creativity squashed by what seemed like a good idea yesterday. So we have built for you an incredible, future-proof machine learning kitchen. This kitchen can expand, contract as you need it. You can plug in whatever you like, all the most modern appliances are there and compatible as you need them, fully customizable. Because none of us can tell what innovations the future will bring, and we don't want you to have to bet on the direction of progress and lock yourselves in. We want you to be free to be as creative as all of us can be together. So I hope that you're excited to dive in. This machine learning kitchen is there ready waiting for you to get started, start playing in it. Your machine learning adventure awaits. Thanks so much.\nAttendees: Now if there's a company that understands these changes, including machine learning and big data as well as open source and collaboration, it's Google.

And so the bad news there is that there is quite a lot of education that you need to get, it takes a little while to ramp up because how on earth are you going to build a better microwave than the one that exists already, there's some pretty sophisticated stuff out there, if you have no idea how the current one works? So that's the bad news, it takes a long time to become a machine learning researcher. The good news though is that if that is your cup of tea, we at Google have a large machine learning research shop where we make these tools for you that are all powered by open source. So we give you those wiring diagrams as a springboard so that you can go and build a better microwave than what we have, using our blueprints. And TensorFlow, a really popular machine learning project, started at Google before we open sourced it because we believe that the community as a whole so much more innovative than just any one of us alone. But let's face it, most of you are not here to build general-purpose microwaves. You just want to get cooking already, right? You just want to use these things to solve business problems, and so you are in the completely other discipline, applied machine learning. Now for that, you do not need a PhD. You don't need to know how back propagation works and neural networks any more than a chef needs to know how a microwave is wired. Instead, what you need is a really good kitchen to play in. And we at Google, provide that for you. Let me show you some of the things that we have. And what you're going to need kind of depends on what you're cooking. If you're cooking with usual ingredients, data, and you're making usual dishes, labels, predictions. So say you're making pizza, please don't go reinvent the concept of pizza from scratch. There's already recipes out there and you can just grab those recipes and start making pizza, and that is what our cloud APIs are all about. These are recipes that we've already built that you can just pick up and start using. You can just plug them into your apps to make those intelligent applications. But say you're cooking with a little twist. Now, it's gluten-free, vegan pizza. Well, you still don't need to -- you still don't need to start entirely from scratch, it's still pizza. You can just adjust what already exists out there. And so what we suggest for you here is try cloud AutoML. Sure, maybe we haven't trained our vision system on the clothing type that your Kohl's customers are wearing, but no problem, just feed in your images with your labels into cloud AutoML, and you'll be good to go, only a small adjustment necessary. Now say you're truly innovating, you have your own completely unique ingredients, you're doing something pretty different in the kitchen. I don't know, maybe now you're making an edible sock that tastes like pizza. Well, machine learning and innovation are in Google's core DNA. In fact, I can't think of a single one of our consumer products that doesn't have machine learning in it somewhere. And so if you are innovating in the kitchen, if you're building truly new recipes, what we have for you is cloud machine learning engine. This is access to exactly the same infrastructure that Google uses to train our models, incredible. So you could, if you wanted to, after this session, grab a laptop, open it up and test drive our shiny, gleaming kitchen with all those appliances ready to go, and you could feel the thrill of a data center and all this cutting-edge algorithms rising up to do your bidding. So solving business problems with machine learning, applied machine learning is far easier than what most people think. But you don't realize this that all those courses in university, those are all about how to build the microwave, not how to just use it to get cooking. And when I hear people say \"oh, I couldn't possibly get started with machine learning until I take a course in it or, goodness, a whole degree,\" I couldn't help but imagine that same person saying \"I couldn't possibly use a microwave until I've built one myself.\" You can just get cooking. It's not the lack of degree or course or knowledge that's holding you back. What's much, much more important than that, what you need to get started is creativity. Figure out what you're going to cook because all those tools are already there waiting for you to use them. Imagine gleaming kitchens just waiting for you to come play in them. But since this is a thing labeler, you need to start by thinking what on earth do you want labeled and see how creative you can get with that. You might imagine the label being maybe the wave form that sounds like a voice that could make a hairdresser's appointment for you. Or you can imagine a few other cases like maybe you are a loving son and your aging parents sort vegetables by hand and you want to save them the trouble of having to do that on their farm. So maybe, you're thinking about building a system that will label the vegetables and sort it automatically so your parents don't have to do it. Or maybe you're worried about the ingredients that go into baby food and you think it would be great if you could automatically check whether the ingredient is safe or spoiled before it goes in. Or maybe you're into the idea of a huge bank with trillions of dollars in assets, countering fraud and money laundering automatically across millions of accounts. If you imagine that world, you imagined this world. Well, these are all real examples of things that have been done on Google Cloud platform. The first is a real family of cucumber farmers; the second is a Japanese manufacturer of high-quality baby food products, Kewpie; and the third is HSBC who uses Google Cloud to run a better business and catch the bad guys across 27 million customers. Pretty different chefs, completely different applications. Why is Google Cloud platform the right choice for all of them? Well, think about what you might want in a kitchen. You'd want good engineering so you probably want to think about getting a partner whose quality you trust. But think more long term than that. If you believe in your own infinite creativity, if you believe in the future, you would be crazy to let yourself get locked into a kitchen where the purveyor sets it up one time for you and then controls what you can and can't have in there, and every appliance has its own proprietary little socket that you are not allowed to tamper with. And if your business changes, then you have to rebuild and rewire the whole thing. Imagine instead, the dream kitchen that becomes what you need it to be instantly. Complete universal wiring, open interfaces, the best of everything, all the modern appliances always available, and you can plug them in with no fuss because that wiring is universal. That, my friends, is the power of open source, and that is what Google and Red Hat together believe in. We don't want to see your creativity squashed by what seemed like a good idea yesterday. So we have built for you an incredible, future-proof machine learning kitchen. This kitchen can expand, contract as you need it. You can plug in whatever you like, all the most modern appliances are there and compatible as you need them, fully customizable. Because none of us can tell what innovations the future will bring, and we don't want you to have to bet on the direction of progress and lock yourselves in. We want you to be free to be as creative as all of us can be together. So I hope that you're excited to dive in. This machine learning kitchen is there, ready, waiting for you to get started, start playing in it. Your machine learning adventure awaits. Thanks so much.\nAttendees: Now, if there's a company that understands these changes, including machine learning and big data as well as open source and collaboration, it's Google. You saw one of Google's open source projects, TensorFlow, in today's demo. In just a few minutes, Google Chief Decision Scientist will be here. But before she gives you more information about what intelligent apps will really look like, we'll hear from a shared customer, Kohl's, about their journey with Red Hat and Google. \nSo please welcome Ritch from Kohl's and Cassie from Google.\nAttendees: All right. Most of you know Kohl's as a chain of leading American department stores, but you might not know that they've also been a long-time customer of Red Hat. Ritch, could you tell us a little bit about Kohl's and your relationship with us?\nAttendees: Sure thing. So first of all, it's great to be here. I was really looking forward to summit this year, and then I saw Weezer was playing, and that put me right over the top, icing on the cake, so looking forward to that. So Kohl's, we're a department store, almost 1,200 stores, 49 states, about $19 billion in revenue. We've got about a 1,000-person IT shop, another 2,500 people in managed services around the globe, so big, big technology footprint. We're based in Wisconsin outside Milwaukee, but we also have a tech center here in Silicon Valley, in Milpitas. So long time Red Hat customer. When I got to Kohl's about 8 years ago, there was a small pocket in the data center running RHEL. And it was a distant third out of 3 operating systems at Kohl's. And I look today years later, RHEL is the predominant operating system and we've just signed on for OpenShift as our PaaS platform in our hybrid cloud effort. We have efforts underway around Gluster, ActiveMQ. We have a relentless automation effort, Ansible plays a big part there. So we are very excited about our future with Red Hat. We've had a good history. The future looks even brighter. It's a big part of our digital transformation.\nExecutives: So we at Google are thrilled to be on this journey with you. Can you tell us a little bit more about why you picked Google as a partner?\nAttendees: Yes. So as we embarked on our hybrid cloud journey, we felt it was important to pick a primary public cloud provider. One cloud provider -- even though multi-cloud is inevitable, we felt 1 primary was the right approach where you would go very deep and understand that platform, all the nuances, how to optimize your workloads to run cost-effectively, how to use networking, all the details and we chose Google, and there's really a few reasons for that. One is we're an existing customer. We use G Suite, Ads, but more importantly, there were a few things. One, engineering. We think Google's engineering is really top-notch. And as we did our reference calls, time and time again we heard that not only is the engineering great, but you have access to the engineering resources. So we felt that was really important. Two, Google, it was really interesting. They said, \"Hey, yes, those GCP deals are great.\" I appreciate that, but what do you want to do together? Like, what problems do you want to solve in retail? And we found that pretty interesting but I think lastly, the tiebreaker, a lot of great cloud offerings out there, was machine learning. We believe that, like all of you probably, that that's the next big unlock in our industry. And we felt that Google was really the leader in that space and that's where we wanted to hit our wagon.\nExecutives: That's a topic really close to my heart, and I'm so glad that you've chosen us. Thank you.\nAttendees: So Ritch, you've been moving really quickly and even ahead of many of your peers. So it sounds like Red Hat and Google have both played a role in that. What do we offer both -- what do we both offer together that you don't get elsewhere?\nAttendees: Sure. So I would say that as I've gone through my career, one of the things I've gotten a much greater appreciation for is the value of partnerships. I would say earlier in my career, I didn't probably spend a lot of energy on that. But having gone through really good partnerships and other partnerships that weren't so good, it can take years, if not a decade, to unwind from some of those decisions that you make, right? So I think the secret is this: the secret is to understand what your values are as a company and then go find partners that align to those values, okay? So with us, it's pretty simple. We're a very engineering-led organization and we feel that you guys both align really nicely to that. Secondly, we're very committed to a future of open source, okay? Not only just open source, but enterprise-grade open source, right, that we can run our business on. So we felt that with the future being so uncertain, you don't know where all this is going 5 years from now, so what you need to do is find a partner that has the right stuff in their DNA so that as new products are announced and new acquisitions are made, you know they're going to continue on that path of engineering-centric and a commitment to open source. So to us, that's really what it's about and that's why we're thrilled to partner with these 2 companies and looking forward to a great future.\nAttendees: Well, thanks a lot. I love hearing the kind of open source collaboration is what really brings this partnership to the forefront. So we'll turn it over to Cassie. Thank you.\nExecutives: So how many of you had that moment where you realize everyone is using some word and you have no idea what that means but you're too afraid to ask at this point? What even is machine learning? Well, it's an approach to making lots of small decisions with data, something involving algorithmically finding patterns in data, but let me just put it bluntly so that we can all get it. \nIt's a thing labeler essentially, that's what machine learning is. It's just a thing labeler. So why on earth should you be excited about thing labeling? Well, here's my pet Huxley, and you've just taken in some pretty complicated data through your senses and you just know that that's a cat. And if I show you a different image, you're not fooled, you still know that, that label is cat. Your brain just does this, you don't even know how your brain does it. Now, if we want to get a computer to perform this labeling task for us, if we went the traditional way, you know this, programmers, we would communicate with the universe in some way, think really deeply about the problem and come up with a model. It's a model, it's just a recipe, it's a set of instructions that a computer has to follow to get from the image to the label. And we would have to hand craft that.  Now, think about what this recipe would have to be for the computer to correctly detect that there's a cat in the image. I mean, think about what you, your brain actually did with those pixels. Can you express that? Do you know what your brain is doing? Or have you just had the benefit of eons of evolution and it just kind of figures it out for you? Now, that recipe is really hard to handcraft. Wouldn't it be better if you could just say to the machine: here, look at a bunch of examples of cats, look at a bunch of examples of not cats and just figure it out yourself. That is what machine learning is all about. It is a completely different programming paradigm. Now instead of giving explicit instructions, you program with examples, with data and let that machine learning algorithm figure it out and stitch that code that goes in between for you. So why should you actually be excited by this thing labeling? \nWell, engineers, you know we like to get computers to do stuff for us and there's a whole class of tasks where we just cannot express the instructions, they're ineffable. AI and machine learning are about automating the ineffable. This is a fundamental leap in human progress. Now you can get computers to do tasks where you cannot possibly express the instructions. This is so exciting and seems futuristic and difficult, right? And when you think about machine learning, the one thing I most want you to think about is microwaves. Who here in the audience knows how a microwave oven works well enough to build a new one from scratch? Raise hands. Who can build a new one? Do I see any takers, any takers? No hands? Yes, me neither. Who here has never used one to reheat food? You all have. Even though you have no idea how it works, you're still happy to use one, right? And anyone here feel like you would have no idea how to get hold of one, I don't know, like maybe add Kohl's, if you needed one? Now, you just told me you have no idea how it works so how could you possibly trust this microwave? Well, you're not going to trust it by reading the wiring diagram, are you? You're going to trust it by taking that it actually does work, by having a good idea of what you want it to do for you and then tasting what comes out on the other side. And that is exactly what you'll do with machine learning, and this is a perfect analogy for machine learning. Now what they don't tell you about machine learning, when we use that term, it's actually 2 machine learnings, not 1. Two completely different disciplines that are as different as building microwaves from scratch and innovating in the kitchen. And you need completely different skill sets for these. If you want to be a machine learning researcher, you are building general-purpose tools for other people to use. And so the bad news there is that there is quite a lot of education that you need to get, it takes a little while to ramp up because how on earth are you going to build a better microwave than the one that exists already, there's some pretty sophisticated stuff out there, if you have no idea how the current one works?

And so the bad news there is that there is quite a lot of education that you need to get, it takes a little while to ramp up because how on earth are you going to build a better microwave than the one that exists already, there's some pretty sophisticated stuff out there, if you have no idea how the current one works? So that's the bad news, it takes a long time to become a machine learning researcher. The good news though is that if that is your cup of tea, we at Google have a large machine learning research shop where we make these tools for you that are all powered by open source. So we give you those wiring diagrams as a springboard so that you can go and build a better microwave than what we have, using our blueprints. And TensorFlow, a really popular machine learning project, started at Google before we open sourced it because we believe that the community as a whole so much more innovative than just any one of us alone. But let's face it, most of you are not here to build general-purpose microwaves. You just want to get cooking already, right? You just want to use these things to solve business problems, and so you are in the completely other discipline, applied machine learning. Now for that, you do not need a PhD. You don't need to know how back propagation works and neural networks any more than a chef needs to know how a microwave is wired. Instead, what you need is a really good kitchen to play in. And we at Google, provide that for you. Let me show you some of the things that we have. And what you're going to need kind of depends on what you're cooking. If you're cooking with usual ingredients, data, and you're making usual dishes, labels, predictions. So say you're making pizza, please don't go reinvent the concept of pizza from scratch. There's already recipes out there and you can just grab those recipes and start making pizza, and that is what our cloud APIs are all about. These are recipes that we've already built that you can just pick up and start using. You can just plug them into your apps to make those intelligent applications. But say you're cooking with a little twist. Now, it's gluten-free, vegan pizza. Well, you still don't need to -- you still don't need to start entirely from scratch, it's still pizza. You can just adjust what already exists out there. And so what we suggest for you here is try cloud AutoML. Sure, maybe we haven't trained our vision system on the clothing type that your Kohl's customers are wearing, but no problem, just feed in your images with your labels into cloud AutoML, and you'll be good to go, only a small adjustment necessary. Now say you're truly innovating, you have your own completely unique ingredients, you're doing something pretty different in the kitchen. I don't know, maybe now you're making an edible sock that tastes like pizza. Well, machine learning and innovation are in Google's core DNA. In fact, I can't think of a single one of our consumer products that doesn't have machine learning in it somewhere. And so if you are innovating in the kitchen, if you're building truly new recipes, what we have for you is cloud machine learning engine. This is access to exactly the same infrastructure that Google uses to train our models, incredible. So you could, if you wanted to, after this session, grab a laptop, open it up and test drive our shiny, gleaming kitchen with all those appliances ready to go, and you could feel the thrill of a data center and all this cutting-edge algorithms rising up to do your bidding. So solving business problems with machine learning, applied machine learning is far easier than what most people think. But you don't realize this that all those courses in university, those are all about how to build the microwave, not how to just use it to get cooking. \nAnd when I hear people say \"Oh, I couldn't possibly get started with machine learning until I take a course in it or, goodness, a whole degree,\" I couldn't help but imagine that same person saying \"I couldn't possibly use a microwave until I've built one myself.\" You can just get cooking. It's not the lack of degree or course or knowledge that's holding you back. What's much, much more important than that, what you need to get started is creativity. Figure out what you're going to cook because all those tools are already there waiting for you to use them. Imagine gleaming kitchens just waiting for you to come play in them. But since this is a thing labeler, you need to start by thinking what on earth do you want labeled and see how creative you can get with that. You might imagine the label being maybe the wave form that sounds like a voice that could make a hairdresser's appointment for you. Or you can imagine a few other cases like maybe you are a loving son and your aging parents sort vegetables by hand and you want to save them the trouble of having to do that on their farm. So maybe, you're thinking about building a system that will label the vegetables and sort it automatically so your parents don't have to do it. Or maybe you're worried about the ingredients that go into baby food and you think it would be great if you could automatically check whether the ingredient is safe or spoiled before it goes in. Or maybe you're into the idea of a huge bank with trillions of dollars in assets, countering fraud and money laundering automatically across millions of accounts. If you imagine that world, you imagined this world. Well, these are all real examples of things that have been done on Google Cloud platform. The first is a real family of cucumber farmers; the second is a Japanese manufacturer of high-quality baby food products, Kewpie; and the third is HSBC who uses Google Cloud to run a better business and catch the bad guys across 27 million customers. Pretty different chefs, completely different applications. Why is Google Cloud platform the right choice for all of them? Well, think about what you might want in a kitchen. You'd want good engineering so you probably want to think about getting a partner whose quality you trust. But think more long term than that. If you believe in your own infinite creativity, if you believe in the future, you would be crazy to let yourself get locked into a kitchen where the purveyor sets it up one time for you and then controls what you can and can't have in there, and every appliance has its own proprietary little socket that you are not allowed to tamper with. And if your business changes, then you have to rebuild and rewire the whole thing. Imagine instead, the dream kitchen that becomes what you need it to be instantly. Complete universal wiring, open interfaces, the best of everything, all the modern appliances always available, and you can plug them in with no fuss because that wiring is universal.\nThat, my friends, is the power of open source, and that is what Google and Red Hat together believe in. We don't want to see your creativity squashed by what seemed like a good idea yesterday. So we have built for you an incredible, future-proof machine learning kitchen. This kitchen can expand, contract as you need it. You can plug in whatever you like, all the most modern appliances are there and compatible as you need them, fully customizable. Because none of us can tell what innovations the future will bring, and we don't want you to have to bet on the direction of progress and lock yourselves in. We want you to be free to be as creative as all of us can be together. So I hope that you're excited to dive in. \nThis machine learning kitchen is there, ready, waiting for you to get started, start playing in it. Your machine learning adventure awaits. Thanks so much.",

         "Google LLC, Squarespace, Inc. - M&A Call",
         "Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Sara, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Squarespace's conference call to discuss their definitive agreement to acquire Google Domains assets. [Operator Instructions]\nI will now hand the call over to your host at Squarespace, Clare Perry. Clare, please go ahead.\nExecutives: Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on short notice. As you've seen this afternoon, we've announced Squarespace's proposed acquisition of Google's Domain assets. I'm Clare Perry, Head of Investor Relations. Joining us today to discuss the transaction is Anthony Casalena, Squarespace Founder and CEO. Nathan Gooden, CFO, is on the line as well. Please note that we will not be commenting on our second quarter 2023 or expected full year 2023 guidance during today's call. We expect to provide additional disclosure at our Q2 2023 earnings call. \nWe'd like to remind you that during the course of this conference call, management will make forward-looking statements, including statements regarding the demand and market opportunity for our products and subscriptions, including our beliefs about the anticipated benefits of the proposed acquisition of Google Domains assets for us and Google Domain customers as well as forward-looking statements regarding the anticipated timing of close and our migration and integration plan and our continued execution and focus on providing more value to our customers. \nAlso statements other than historical facts, including our beliefs about the anticipated benefits, our continued execution and focus and the expected benefits of the proposed transaction, are forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current expectations, assumptions, estimates and beliefs. \nWhile we believe these expectations, assumptions, estimates and beliefs are reasonable, such forward-looking statements are only predictions and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties which are beyond our control and which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these statements. These forward-looking statements apply as of today, and one should not rely on them as representing our views in the future. \nToday's call is being recorded, and all participants are currently in listen-only mode. Following brief prepared remarks, we'll open up the call to your questions. With that, I'll turn over the call to Anthony.\nExecutives: Thank you, Clare. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. I'm thrilled to be able to share more about our proposed acquisition of the Google Domains asset. This acquisition offers an unprecedented opportunity to significantly expand our existing domains business and offer our website building tools and other services to millions of additional customers. We're proud to have been chosen as the custodian for these millions of customers and are excited to be working with Google on this critical piece of Internet architecture. Under the terms of this acquisition, approximately 10 million domain names currently managed by Google will be moved to be managed by Squarespace. \nSquarespace's expansive suite of products for entrepreneurs range from websites, e-commerce and marketing tools as well as tools for scheduling with Acuity, creating and managing social media presence with Bio Sites and Unfold and hospitality business management via Tock. Domains are a critical part of web infrastructure and a starting point for many people's journey to establish their online presence. Today, domains are the highest attached product to our core website offering, and we've been investing in our domains business for nearly a decade. \nExisting Google Domains customers will be onboarded to Squarespace's core domains platform, which we've already been investing in for a decade. Squarespace offers some of the most comprehensive domain registration tools in the industry, all embedded within our integrated platform. Throughout the transition period, both Squarespace and Google will remain focused on ensuring a seamless migration for our customers. We will be leveraging existing Google Domains infrastructure to ensure that this process results in no disruption. \nUnder the terms of our agreement, we will honor all existing Google Domains customers' domain renewal prices for at least 12 months following the closing of this transaction. In addition, we'll be providing exclusive incentives to Google Domains customers who wish to adopt any of Squarespace's services moving forward. We do expect to see some degree of natural churn during this transition period as some Google Domains customers may no longer have a need for the domain while some may seek out another solution. \nSquarespace has been a long-time reseller of Google Workspace, and this deal expands and strengthens this partnership. For a period of at least 3 years upon closing, Squarespace will become the exclusive domain provider for any customer purchasing a domain along with our Workspace subscription from Google. \nSome details related to the transaction. Under the terms of the agreement, the purchase price of $180 million is financed through cash on hand and an extension of our existing credit facility. Further details are available in the 8-K we filed earlier today. We expect the transition to close in Q3 2023, subject to the satisfaction of certain regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. We believe this transaction will be meaningfully accretive to our top line and cash flow. And we will see immediate -- and while we will see immediate economic gains after we close this transaction, the majority of the benefits that will be realized in years 2024 and beyond. Additional disclosures about the financial impact of this deal will appear in future financial updates. \nI'd like to again thank Google for believing in us as a partner, and I look forward to what I believe will be a fruitful deal for both of our companies and our customers. With that, let's open the line to your questions.\nOperator: Our first question comes from Trevor Young with Barclays.\nAnalysts: Great. Two, if I may. First, on the 10 million domain installed base that you're getting. Are all of those customers currently at that $12 a year pricing? Or are some of those domains maybe at lower pricing or even free for some of the existing Google customers as part of like some broader promotion and that sort of thing? \nAnd then second one, Anthony, historically, the few acquisitions you've done before were to get some interesting tech, maybe some talent or just features that are a bit differentiated from peers like Tock and Unfold. Domains is maybe a little bit more vanilla and commodity. So just help us think through what's the opportunity that you're playing for here? And what can -- how can you be differentiated on Domains?\nExecutives: Sure. So to your first question around price, I think you're citing what I believe is the lowest of the price is around $12 a year for dotcoms. And I believe they go up from there, depending on TLD. To my knowledge, there are no domains given for free, mostly because, I mean, domains have an underlying cost with Verisign if it's a dotcom. So I don't believe there's any other subsidies or whatnot being given. So all the domains are paid. \nAnd secondarily, I mean, in terms of the opportunity, this is just incredible for us. By the way, it's -- up to 10 million domains could transfer, some could transfer away, et cetera, et cetera. I think we're the best place for these domains, especially considering the landscape of options. But I mean, of these 10 million domains, this is like our lifeblood. These are starting points for websites. They're starting points for entrepreneurs. So we're just so excited to be expanding our business this significantly and also this deeper partnership with Google so that we can be in front of a whole new cohort of new customers with their starting point. \nSo it's a really unique opportunity for us. I have referred to it as maybe bumps in the lifetime. And certainly not in the vein of anything we've done in the past, but we've never seen something like this in the past. And frankly, I doubt we'll ever see something like it again.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ken Wong with Oppenheimer.\nAnalysts: Great. Fantastic. A super interesting acquisition here, Anthony. I was just wondering, can you give us any sense of what the annual domain additions from the Google Domain business might look like as we think about what that potential new customer funnel could potentially be?\nExecutives: So there's a lot of publicly available information on domains and their growth rate for various registrars, which I'm sure you will look up. We won't be providing anything additionally at this time. But there's a multitude of opportunities here. We've got the domains that will be coming in. We'll be -- the underlying reseller agreement we have with Google now, which we'll be providing back-end services for the domains. And then just the ones that are, of course, transferring over as part of the overall agreement. So this represents a really interesting shift in the industry, and I'm just really happy with how we're positioned here.\nAnalysts: Got it. And then as far as just the domain business, natural, there is a good attach on to kind of the core website. Just wondering, as far as registrar, is Squarespace a registrar? Or do you currently utilize a partner on the domain side of things?\nExecutives: We are currently a registrar, and we manage -- we use that registrar to manage some of the most popular TLDs that are on the platform, com, net and org, things like that, which gives us advantageous positioning in terms of our margins. Both Squarespace and Google do rely -- Google Domains currently do rely on a number of other partners to do the long tail of TLD registrations, especially ccTLDs. So we'll continue to move more domains just based on demand into our registrar, but the -- everyone relies on partners to get that 400th domain TLD into the platform.\nAnalysts: Got it. And if I could just maybe sneak a quick one. Just margins -- should we think of this business as having comparable margin profile to the website business? And any color there?\nExecutives: Well, our current domains business doesn't have comparable margins to the website business, right? We manage millions of domains right now. I think over time, there's an ability to improve margin here and there's a lot of tests we can do and other things. But this is not like a loss leader business for us. So -- nor is it for any of the other large companies that sell domains right now.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris  Zhang with Credit Suisse.\nAnalysts: So I have 2 questions. The first one, on the exclusivity part, just wondering about the mechanics. So historically, we think of the need for Google Workspace arising from somebody already using a web builder, for example, Squarespace, and then they decide to use, add a Google Workspace. But to the extent that Google Workspace can serve as kind of a funnel for new customers to Squarespace, historically, what's that like? So what's the kind of percentage of the new customers that typically come from someone that wants to use a Google Workspace and then discovers that we can use Google Workspace, Google Domains. And then from there, since it's -- since they're able to use Squarespace and then add Squarespace, can you give any thoughts on that? And I have a follow-up on the mechanics.\nExecutives: Sure. If I understand the question, I mean, look, there's a lot of ways people go about establishing the core things they need to be -- need to be online. I'd say those core things are a domain and e-mail address and a website. And so at Squarespace, sometimes they're starting with the website. Sometimes they're starting with the domain. We support both those paths. And also conversely, Google, sometimes people are starting with Workspace and then they want the domain or the website. \nAnd so the mechanics of it work like this. If you are in Workspace and you're signing up for a domain, they will use an API call behind the scenes to register that domain with Squarespace using our infrastructure as the registrar. But that domain and that front-end customer experience will still be managed by Google. Now we do have -- advantageous to -- we're in a great spot to also sell them a website later, but that's kind of how those mechanics work.\nAnalysts: Got it. That's super helpful. And I think to the extent you can convert additional customers on the domain to Squarespace, what would you think of the percentage that are out of the 10 million domain users? For example, I'd imagine it's probably going to be a little harder for somebody that's already using a competitor's solution just because of the way to like rebuild the website? Or is there going to be any solution to make them -- to convert to Squarespace easier?\nExecutives: We, of course, have our internal models of why we were confident in doing this deal. I'd say that what we're going to be doing over the next couple of months as we -- the first and foremost thing we're focused on is just business continuity and making sure this is smooth for everybody and that we're doing this and there's no disruptions. \nAnd then after that, and I spoke about it earlier and I alluded to it in the press release, there's a lot of opportunities for us to say, hey, where -- you're a new customer of Squarespace, what can we do for you that's kind of an outsized incentive to use Squarespace's products if that's something you want to use? \nI mean there's plenty of people who use Squarespace and only have the domains with us. That's not a rare use case. So I just think it's just great positioning, and I'm super excited about the partnership.\nAnalysts: All right. Anthony, congrats on the transaction.\nExecutives: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Ygal Arounian with Citi.\nAnalysts: Just a follow-up on that last question first. Do you have any sense of how many customers are -- how  many Google Domain customers are currently using Squarespace to build their website? Is that what you're referring to with your internal models? And I have a follow-up.\nExecutives: Yes, we're not really seeing any breakdowns of kind of the services that people are using right now. Yes, it's all across the board.\nAnalysts: Okay. Great. And then I just wanted to maybe hear a little bit more about how you think about domains as kind of a top-of-funnel marketing tool. As we think about how people start their journey, so you talked about the core things that people need to establish to be online. I see some real marketing efficiency over the past couple of quarters. Is this a tool where you could see kind of increased marketing efficiency around -- it's a lower price point just to start a domain versus to start a website? How do you think about that opportunity?\nExecutives: Well, it represents a giant marketing funnel for us. I mean we have millions of domains under management just because of the opportunity to have up to 10 million more without the ongoing synergies that will cause even more people to go kind of over to our platform. And it's going to help us, of course, sell Squarespace services into these millions of domains and millions of customers. So that's kind of really positive for us moving forward. \nLook, just in terms of like the importance of domains, people, a lot of times -- and these are just the 2 flows that we provide on the front of Squarespace right now. Some people want to start with the website. Some people have an idea. They buy a domain, they park it, and they build the website later. So it really just depends where you are and how you prefer to get started. \nBut I mean, right now, I think more than ever, just owning that piece of the Internet, that's the authoritative you, like just a domain is so inexpensive compared to what it is. I mean our price is $20 a year. And you own this piece of the Internet that you control what's on. It's authoritative. \nSo we don't really see the importance of this going away anytime soon. And in fact, as your online presence becomes more and more important, like this is your online real estate, it's critical. So it's why we've been investing in it for a decade. This is not a new business for us. So it's just such a great opportunity for us to be able to strengthen that business and really invest in the domains product further because it's such a critical part of our whole ecosystem.\nAnalysts: If I can ask also one quick follow-up. Is there anything you could share on this just in the conversations with Google during this -- why they were kind of interested in selling this asset, the rationale from their end. I don't know if there's anything you could share or not, but if there is, I'd be interested in that.\nExecutives: Yes. You'd have to reach out to them for commentary on their strategy. I'm mostly focused on why this was just a fantastic opportunity for us because it's just so critical to the website infrastructure. And again, we've been doing this for a decade, almost a decade. We've been a Google Workspace reseller for almost a decade. It's just a really natural fit for our -- in our world. So we're really excited.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Siti Panigrahi.\nAnalysts: I guess everybody is trying to understand that maybe the authoritative part of that comment you said because that's kind of a cross-sell opportunity is kind of what we see there because domain name kind of pretty slow growth, low single-digit kind of growth, domain name's kind of getting saturated, what I think the cross-sell opportunity you said. \nSo I guess I wanted to understand like anybody those who have a domain name had access to other -- all your competitors have access to them, they can reach out to that. So what -- is it the bundling part of it? You can bundle it, your domain name registration along with this, that's sort of attractive, I mean, for those who don't have a website? \nAnd second thing, those who have a website, what really drives someone to change their website and start building something on Squarespace? It's purely a displacement market. So what would trigger that to do it?\nExecutives: So what would trigger somebody to change their website? I mean it's the same kind of factors would kind of be the existing factors in addition to the fact that for us, during this, I mean, just a number of things to emphasize. We're maintaining price continuity. We are reutilizing existing infrastructure to ensure that this is seamless, right? \nSo if you wanted to change registrars right now, one, you have to pay the change because you have to renew your domain to transfer. And then two, you have to make sure all your settings are right so that it doesn't throw up your website or your e-mail and all that. So we're managing all that using existing infrastructure. \nAnd then on top of that -- and we haven't rolled out any of this out yet because we're just at the very beginning of this deal. We're going to be providing interesting incentives and opportunities to people who've moved over as part of this transition for some period of time to utilize Squarespace services. \nSo obviously, just like it is currently on our business, the upsell, cross-sell around the domain, just getting that trio of things attached to it, domain, e-mail, website is really important. And look, domains are not -- well, not the worst margins ever, they're not the highest margin stuff we do. Obviously, that's the website business. And so again, it's a business we've been in for a long time, and we're just excited to have the new opportunities in front of us and to expand it.\nAnalysts: That's a good color. And then do you have any number out of the 10 million, how many of this domain name don't have any websites at this point?\nExecutives: We have an idea, but we're not kind of breaking that down publicly right now.\nAnalysts: Okay. All right.\nExecutives: I mean part of the advantage of us kind of in this kind of process is that, again, this is a business we've had for 10 years. And so we have our own view on churn, pricing, cross-sell, upsell. And we're not treating these the exact same as the domain that would have come in through us, but we're not kind of operating blind here. We have our own infrastructure that runs domain. We support domains right now with our customer operations group. We support Google Workspace with our customer operations group. \nSo in that sense, it's sort of like, it's kind of ideal in a way because, again, we're buying assets here. We don't have to buy any IP. There's a salary change. We're not buying a bunch of head count. There's no infrastructure. I mean, we're utilizing Google's infrastructure, but we're not like -- it's not like buying a company, which, again, I think is very, very good in this transaction for us.\nOperator: The next question comes from Andrew Boone with JMP Securities.\nAnalysts: I wanted to go and ask about the scale of adding 10 million domains for Squarespace. What does that unlock operationally? Does that imply that you guys go after aftermarket? Does that imply anything else now that you guys have more scale?\nExecutives: Yes. So it's up to 10 million depending on what transfers and what doesn't. We think it will be -- we're confident that we're a really, really great home for Domain's customers. What I think about in terms of the future, maybe not going all the way into aftermarket yet but just really making sure that our domains product is the best in the world and that there is no reason why you would ever want to manage a domain anywhere else. \nIt's already very, very, very good. And this will just increase our investment there. But again, it's not like we have to double it, triple it because we've already put so much work into this. So I think it allows us to invest more, but we've always been very disciplined about kind of our headcount and our -- the initiatives that we're on and controlling our cost structure. So we get the thing that's great about this, and we mentioned in the press release, we think this is accretive to both the top and bottom line over time.\nAnalysts: And for my second question, can you just talk about the deal coming together? Was it competitive? How kind of -- how fast or how slow did it take? Just any other details you can share there.\nExecutives: I can't share a lot of details. Obviously, this is an opportunity that a lot of people would have really been very interested in. I think I'm very happy that we were able to partner with Google on this and strengthen the relationship. And I think it's just so great because, again, we've been doing this with Google for like a decade. And so it's a very natural thing for us to support Workspace, very -- I mean, we're huge resellers of Workspace. We support as a Workspace. I use Workspace personally all the time. Like, so it's -- this is more than just anyone who wanted it. Us and Google care so much about the customer experience during this and making sure that the customers have a good home, and that we are companies that share an ethos and customer service and just making sure we have a quality product. So there's a lot of factors that come into this deal that, again, I'm just very pleased and looking forward to supporting these customers, looking forward to working with Google in a closer fashion.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Aaron Kessler with Raymond James.\nAnalysts: A couple of questions. First, any details you can share in terms of maybe the demographics of the Google Domain customers? Are they similar to your current customer base? And second, I think on the Google Domains website, they're currently -- they currently recommend, I think, like 9, 10 website designers on their site. There's -- have them listed. Do you know if those will still stay the same? Or would that be replaced kind of as a primary shift to Squarespace as well?\nExecutives: Well, I can say that Squarespace will probably recommend Squarespace as the website designer of choice that we would prefer. So I think that one's -- we have a strong opinion there. Regarding the demographic, look, we did not go into this blind. We looked at -- we're not going to obviously show the breakdown of it publicly. \nBut we were able to look at this, look at how it overlap with ours, get confidence or not around which segments we were interested in. And we just found that there was a pretty positive fit here. And so, yes, a lot of that analysis and thinking went into our decision here.\nAnalysts: Got it. And so should we primarily be viewing this deal as kind of a lower-cost marketing funnel versus kind of bidding on traffic on various sites? Or is it much more strategic in nature in terms of the cross-selling abilities?\nExecutives: It's everything at once. It's really positive positioning for us. Obviously, the cross-sell and upsell opportunity here, but it's also accretive to the top and bottom line. So -- and there's the Workspace reseller opportunity. I mean there's a lot. \nAnd also, you mentioned this in the press release. We're going to be servicing a number of domains that are moving over that already are using Google Workspace, and we'll be providing the front-end and support for them as we've done for hundreds of thousands of customers already up to this point, maybe even millions. \nSo all those are kind of parts of this. So it's really a multidimensional thing. But it's not like this should be viewed as like, oh, we did it as a marketing spend. It's a positive business outcome for us as well. The same reason why we don't look at domains currently as a loss leader. It's an important part of the experience. We bundled it in with certain plans. We provide incentives around it, but it's a business for us, too.\nAnalysts: Great. Congrats.\nOperator: Our last question will come from Brad Erickson with RBC.\nAnalysts: Just 2 follow-ups. First, following up on Aaron's question, how would you see this kind of affecting your broader customer acquisition strategy? Obviously, it would seem like it makes it more efficient in general. But just curious how does the rest of your normal course customer acquisition strategy change as you build in this piece to the fold? And then I have a follow-up.\nExecutives: I'm not sure it's such a departure, right? Again, I feel like I'm repeating myself but, like, we've been in the domains business for a long time. We've done advertising related to domains. This is going to increase our investment there. I think that, that will mean that we're one of the best places to have a domain. \nAnd so yes, I think it's going to be really interesting for us. And then, of course, that unlocks the cross-sell, upsell stuff. As mentioned before, attached to a domain is one of the highest attach rates we have. As you might imagine, Squarespace live on domain. So yes, there's a lot of different aspects to this deal rolled into one, and that's what's so exciting about it. And you have a follow-up?\nAnalysts: Got it. Yes, just one last one. You mentioned in the press release, you were -- sort of used the word chosen, to kind of effectively win this acquisition. Just curious, maybe speak to how competitive this situation was? And further, just kind of does this have any implications as it pertains to any of your cloud relationships?\nExecutives: Yes. So the cloud relationship one is easy. We've been a big user of Google Cloud products, and we will use more of them, especially their Cloud DNS products as part of this movement over. What was the first set of question? It's around...\nAnalysts: Just the line that you used in the press release around being chosen suggests that maybe there's some competition. If you can speak to that...\nExecutives: Yes, got it, got it, got it. Yes, I can't speak to that because I just -- I'm on my side of this. I just do know that this is not the kind of thing where -- I mean, again, if you put the customer first and you think where is the best home for these customers in addition to us, obviously, this asset is very valuable. \nI think Squarespace ticks so many boxes in terms of our decade-long relationship with Google, reselling Workspace already, our investment in our own registrar and really everything else we've done up to this point. So we're huge fans of supporting Workspace and supporting Google, and I'm just really grateful to have the opportunity to deepen that relationship.\nOperator: That will conclude today's Q&A session. I will now hand the conference back to our management team for any closing remarks.\nExecutives: No, just thank you all for joining on such short notice. It was a great turnout with only an hour's notice. We're really excited about this deal. I'm really personally excited about this deal. And I look forward to working with Google and supporting everybody and making this great for everyone. So thank you all.\nOperator: This concludes today's call. Thank you so much for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.\nOperator: Good afternoon. My name is Sara, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Squarespace's conference call to discuss their definitive agreement to acquire Google Domains assets. [Operator Instructions]\nI will now hand the call over to your host at Squarespace, Clare Perry. Clare, please go ahead.\nExecutives: Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on short notice. As you've seen this afternoon, we've announced Squarespace's proposed acquisition of Google's Domain assets. I'm Clare Perry, Head of Investor Relations. Joining us today to discuss the transaction is Anthony Casalena, Squarespace Founder and CEO. Nathan Gooden, CFO, is on the line as well. Please note that we will not be commenting on our second quarter 2023 or expected full year 2023 guidance during today's call. We expect to provide additional disclosure at our Q2 2023 earnings call. \nWe'd like to remind you that during the course of this conference call, management will make forward-looking statements, including statements regarding the demand and market opportunity for our products and subscriptions, including our beliefs about the anticipated benefits of the proposed acquisition of Google Domains assets for us and Google Domain customers as well as forward-looking statements regarding the anticipated timing of close and our migration and integration plan and our continued execution and focus on providing more value to our customers. \nAlso statements other than historical facts, including our beliefs about the anticipated benefits, our continued execution and focus and the expected benefits of the proposed transaction, are forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current expectations, assumptions, estimates and beliefs. \nWhile we believe these expectations, assumptions, estimates and beliefs are reasonable, such forward-looking statements are only predictions and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties which are beyond our control and which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these statements. These forward-looking statements apply as of today, and one should not rely on them as representing our views in the future. \nToday's call is being recorded, and all participants are currently in listen-only mode. Following brief prepared remarks, we'll open up the call to your questions. With that, I'll turn over the call to Anthony.\nExecutives: Thank you, Clare. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. I'm thrilled to be able to share more about our proposed acquisition of the Google Domains asset. This acquisition offers an unprecedented opportunity to significantly expand our existing domains business and offer our website building tools and other services to millions of additional customers. We're proud to have been chosen as the custodian for these millions of customers and are excited to be working with Google on this critical piece of Internet architecture. Under the terms of this acquisition, approximately 10 million domain names currently managed by Google will be moved to be managed by Squarespace. \nSquarespace's expansive suite of products for entrepreneurs range from websites, e-commerce and marketing tools as well as tools for scheduling with Acuity, creating and managing social media presence with Bio Sites and Unfold and hospitality business management via Tock. Domains are a critical part of web infrastructure and a starting point for many people's journey to establish their online presence. Today, domains are the highest attached product to our core website offering, and we've been investing in our domains business for nearly a decade. \nExisting Google Domains customers will be onboarded to Squarespace's core domains platform, which we've already been investing in for a decade. Squarespace offers some of the most comprehensive domain registration tools in the industry, all embedded within our integrated platform. Throughout the transition period, both Squarespace and Google will remain focused on ensuring a seamless migration for our customers. We will be leveraging existing Google Domains infrastructure to ensure that this process results in no disruption. \nUnder the terms of our agreement, we will honor all existing Google Domains customers' domain renewal prices for at least 12 months following the closing of this transaction. In addition, we'll be providing exclusive incentives to Google Domains customers who wish to adopt any of Squarespace's services moving forward. We do expect to see some degree of natural churn during this transition period as some Google Domains customers may no longer have a need for the domain while some may seek out another solution. \nSquarespace has been a long-time reseller of Google Workspace, and this deal expands and strengthens this partnership. For a period of at least 3 years upon closing, Squarespace will become the exclusive domain provider for any customer purchasing a domain along with our Workspace subscription from Google. \nSome details related to the transaction. Under the terms of the agreement, the purchase price of $180 million is financed through cash on hand and an extension of our existing credit facility. Further details are available in the 8-K we filed earlier today. We expect the transition to close in Q3 2023, subject to the satisfaction of certain regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. We believe this transaction will be meaningfully accretive to our top line and cash flow. And we will see immediate -- and while we will see immediate economic gains after we close this transaction, the majority of the benefits that will be realized in years 2024 and beyond. Additional disclosures about the financial impact of this deal will appear in future financial updates. \nI'd like to again thank Google for believing in us as a partner, and I look forward to what I believe will be a fruitful deal for both of our companies and our customers. With that, let's open the line to your questions.\nOperator: Our first question comes from Trevor Young with Barclays.\nAnalysts: Great. Two, if I may. First, on the 10 million domain installed base that you're getting. Are all of those customers currently at that $12 a year pricing? Or are some of those domains maybe at lower pricing or even free for some of the existing Google customers as part of like some broader promotion and that sort of thing? \nAnd then second one, Anthony, historically, the few acquisitions you've done before were to get some interesting tech, maybe some talent or just features that are a bit differentiated from peers like Tock and Unfold. Domains is maybe a little bit more vanilla and commodity. So just help us think through what's the opportunity that you're playing for here? And what can -- how can you be differentiated on Domains?\nExecutives: Sure. So to your first question around price, I think you're citing what I believe is the lowest of the price is around $12 a year for dotcoms. And I believe they go up from there, depending on TLD. To my knowledge, there are no domains given for free, mostly because, I mean, domains have an underlying cost with Verisign if it's a dotcom. So I don't believe there's any other subsidies or whatnot being given. So all the domains are paid. \nAnd secondarily, I mean, in terms of the opportunity, this is just incredible for us. By the way, it's -- up to 10 million domains could transfer, some could transfer away, et cetera, et cetera. I think we're the best place for these domains, especially considering the landscape of options. But I mean, of these 10 million domains, this is like our lifeblood. These are starting points for websites. They're starting points for entrepreneurs. So we're just so excited to be expanding our business this significantly and also this deeper partnership with Google so that we can be in front of a whole new cohort of new customers with their starting point. \nSo it's a really unique opportunity for us. I have referred to it as maybe bumps in the lifetime. And certainly not in the vein of anything we've done in the past, but we've never seen something like this in the past. And frankly, I doubt we'll ever see something like it again.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ken Wong with Oppenheimer.\nAnalysts: Great. Fantastic. A super interesting acquisition here, Anthony. I was just wondering, can you give us any sense of what the annual domain additions from the Google Domain business might look like as we think about what that potential new customer funnel could potentially be?\nExecutives: So there's a lot of publicly available information on domains and their growth rate for various registrars, which I'm sure you will look up. We won't be providing anything additionally at this time. But there's a multitude of opportunities here. We've got the domains that will be coming in. We'll be -- the underlying reseller agreement we have with Google now, which we'll be providing back-end services for the domains. And then just the ones that are, of course, transferring over as part of the overall agreement. So this represents a really interesting shift in the industry, and I'm just really happy with how we're positioned here.\nAnalysts: Got it. And then as far as just the domain business, natural, there is a good attach on to kind of the core website. Just wondering, as far as registrar, is Squarespace a registrar? Or do you currently utilize a partner on the domain side of things?\nExecutives: We are currently a registrar, and we manage -- we use that registrar to manage some of the most popular TLDs that are on the platform, com, net and org, things like that, which gives us advantageous positioning in terms of our margins. Both Squarespace and Google do rely -- Google Domains currently do rely on a number of other partners to do the long tail of TLD registrations, especially ccTLDs. So we'll continue to move more domains just based on demand into our registrar, but the -- everyone relies on partners to get that 400th domain TLD into the platform.\nAnalysts: Got it. And if I could just maybe sneak a quick one. Just margins -- should we think of this business as having comparable margin profile to the website business? And any color there?\nExecutives: Well, our current domains business doesn't have comparable margins to the website business, right? We manage millions of domains right now. I think over time, there's an ability to improve margin here and there's a lot of tests we can do and other things. But this is not like a loss leader business for us. So -- nor is it for any of the other large companies that sell domains right now.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris  Zhang with Credit Suisse.\nAnalysts: So I have 2 questions. The first one, on the exclusivity part, just wondering about the mechanics. So historically, we think of the need for Google Workspace arising from somebody already using a web builder, for example, Squarespace, and then they decide to use, add a Google Workspace. But to the extent that Google Workspace can serve as kind of a funnel for new customers to Squarespace, historically, what's that like? \nSo what's the kind of percentage of the new customers that typically come from someone that wants to use a Google Workspace and then discovers that we can use Google Workspace, Google Domains. And then from there, since it's -- since they're able to use Squarespace and then add Squarespace, can you give any thoughts on that? And I have a follow-up on the mechanics.\nExecutives: Sure. If I understand the question, I mean, look, there's a lot of ways people go about establishing the core things they need to be -- need to be online. I'd say those core things are a domain and e-mail address and a website. And so at Squarespace, sometimes they're starting with the website. Sometimes they're starting with the domain. We support both those paths. And also conversely, Google, sometimes people are starting with Workspace and then they want the domain or the website. And so the mechanics of it work like this. \nIf you are in Workspace and you're signing up for a domain, they will use an API call behind the scenes to register that domain with Squarespace using our infrastructure as the registrar. But that domain and that front-end customer experience will still be managed by Google. Now we do have -- advantageous to -- we're in a great spot to also sell them a website later, but that's kind of how those mechanics work.\nAnalysts: Got it. That's super helpful. And I think to the extent you can convert additional customers on the domain to Squarespace, what would you think of the percentage that are out of the 10 million domain users? \nFor example, I'd imagine it's probably going to be a little harder for somebody that's already using a competitor's solution just because of the way to like rebuild the website? Or is there going to be any solution to make them -- to convert to Squarespace easier?\nExecutives: We, of course, have our internal models of why we were confident in doing this deal. I'd say that what we're going to be doing over the next couple of months as we -- the first and foremost thing we're focused on is just business continuity and making sure this is smooth for everybody and that we're doing this and there's no disruptions. \nAnd then after that, and I spoke about it earlier and I alluded to it in the press release, there's a lot of opportunities for us to say, hey, where -- you're a new customer of Squarespace, what can we do for you that's kind of an outsized incentive to use Squarespace's products if that's something you want to use? \nI mean there's plenty of people who use Squarespace and only have the domains with us. That's not a rare use case. So I just think it's just great positioning, and I'm super excited about the partnership.\nAnalysts: All right. Anthony, congrats on the transaction.\nExecutives: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Ygal Arounian with Citi.\nAnalysts: Just a follow-up on that last question first. Do you have any sense of how many customers are -- how  many Google Domain customers are currently using Squarespace to build their website? Is that what you're referring to with your internal models? And I have a follow-up.\nExecutives: Yes, we're not really seeing any breakdowns of kind of the services that people are using right now. Yes, it's all across the board.\nAnalysts: Okay. Great. And then I just wanted to maybe hear a little bit more about how you think about domains as kind of a top-of-funnel marketing tool. As we think about how people start their journey, so you talked about the core things that people need to establish to be online. I see some real marketing efficiency over the past couple of quarters. Is this a tool where you could see kind of increased marketing efficiency around -- it's a lower price point just to start a domain versus to start a website? How do you think about that opportunity?\nExecutives: Well, it represents a giant marketing funnel for us. I mean we have millions of domains under management just because of the opportunity to have up to 10 million more without the ongoing synergies that will cause even more people to go kind of over to our platform. And it's going to help us, of course, sell Squarespace services into these millions of domains and millions of customers. So that's kind of really positive for us moving forward. \nLook, just in terms of like the importance of domains, people, a lot of times -- and these are just the 2 flows that we provide on the front of Squarespace right now. Some people want to start with the website. Some people have an idea. They buy a domain, they park it, and they build the website later. So it really just depends where you are and how you prefer to get started. \nBut I mean, right now, I think more than ever, just owning that piece of the Internet, that's the authoritative you, like just a domain is so inexpensive compared to what it is. I mean our price is $20 a year. And you own this piece of the Internet that you control what's on. It's authoritative. \nSo we don't really see the importance of this going away anytime soon. And in fact, as your online presence becomes more and more important, like this is your online real estate, it's critical. So it's why we've been investing in it for a decade. This is not a new business for us. So it's just such a great opportunity for us to be able to strengthen that business and really invest in the domains product further because it's such a critical part of our whole ecosystem.\nAnalysts: If I can ask also one quick follow-up. Is there anything you could share on this just in the conversations with Google during this -- why they were kind of interested in selling this asset, the rationale from their end. I don't know if there's anything you could share or not, but if there is, I'd be interested in that.\nExecutives: Yes. You'd have to reach out to them for commentary on their strategy. I'm mostly focused on why this was just a fantastic opportunity for us because it's just so critical to the website infrastructure. And again, we've been doing this for a decade, almost a decade. We've been a Google Workspace reseller for almost a decade. It's just a really natural fit for our -- in our world. So we're really excited.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Siti Panigrahi.\nAnalysts: I guess everybody is trying to understand that maybe the authoritative part of that comment you said because that's kind of a cross-sell opportunity is kind of what we see there because domain name kind of pretty slow growth, low single-digit kind of growth, domain name's kind of getting saturated, what I think the cross-sell opportunity you said. \nSo I guess I wanted to understand like anybody those who have a domain name had access to other -- all your competitors have access to them, they can reach out to that. So what -- is it the bundling part of it? You can bundle it, your domain name registration along with this, that's sort of attractive, I mean, for those who don't have a website? \nAnd second thing, those who have a website, what really drives someone to change their website and start building something on Squarespace? It's purely a displacement market. So what would trigger that to do it?\nExecutives: So what would trigger somebody to change their website? I mean it's the same kind of factors would kind of be the existing factors in addition to the fact that for us, during this, I mean, just a number of things to emphasize. We're maintaining price continuity. We are reutilizing existing infrastructure to ensure that this is seamless, right? \nSo if you wanted to change registrars right now, one, you have to pay the change because you have to renew your domain to transfer. And then two, you have to make sure all your settings are right so that it doesn't throw up your website or your e-mail and all that. So we're managing all that using existing infrastructure. \nAnd then on top of that -- and we haven't rolled out any of this out yet because we're just at the very beginning of this deal. We're going to be providing interesting incentives and opportunities to people who've moved over as part of this transition for some period of time to utilize Squarespace services. \nSo obviously, just like it is currently on our business, the upsell, cross-sell around the domain, just getting that trio of things attached to it, domain, e-mail, website is really important. And look, domains are not -- well, not the worst margins ever, they're not the highest margin stuff we do. Obviously, that's the website business. And so again, it's a business we've been in for a long time, and we're just excited to have the new opportunities in front of us and to expand it.\nAnalysts: That's a good color. And then do you have any number out of the 10 million, how many of this domain name don't have any websites at this point?\nExecutives: We have an idea, but we're not kind of breaking that down publicly right now.\nAnalysts: Okay. All right.\nExecutives: I mean part of the advantage of us kind of in this kind of process is that, again, this is a business we've had for 10 years. And so we have our own view on churn, pricing, cross-sell, upsell. And we're not treating these the exact same as the domain that would have come in through us, but we're not kind of operating blind here. We have our own infrastructure that runs domain. We support domains right now with our customer operations group. We support Google Workspace with our customer operations group. \nSo in that sense, it's sort of like, it's kind of ideal in a way because, again, we're buying assets here. We don't have to buy any IP. There's a salary change. We're not buying a bunch of head count. There's no infrastructure. I mean, we're utilizing Google's infrastructure, but we're not like -- it's not like buying a company, which, again, I think is very, very good in this transaction for us.\nOperator: The next question comes from Andrew Boone with JMP Securities.\nAnalysts: I wanted to go and ask about the scale of adding 10 million domains for Squarespace. What does that unlock operationally? Does that imply that you guys go after aftermarket? Does that imply anything else now that you guys have more scale?\nExecutives: Yes. So it's up to 10 million depending on what transfers and what doesn't. We think it will be -- we're confident that we're a really, really great home for Domain's customers. What I think about in terms of the future, maybe not going all the way into aftermarket yet but just really making sure that our domains product is the best in the world and that there is no reason why you would ever want to manage a domain anywhere else. \nIt's already very, very, very good. And this will just increase our investment there. But again, it's not like we have to double it, triple it because we've already put so much work into this. So I think it allows us to invest more, but we've always been very disciplined about kind of our headcount and our -- the initiatives that we're on and controlling our cost structure. So we get the thing that's great about this, and we mentioned in the press release, we think this is accretive to both the top and bottom line over time.\nAnalysts: And for my second question, can you just talk about the deal coming together? Was it competitive? How kind of -- how fast or how slow did it take? Just any other details you can share there.\nExecutives: I can't share a lot of details. Obviously, this is an opportunity that a lot of people would have really been very interested in. I think I'm very happy that we were able to partner with Google on this and strengthen the relationship. And I think it's just so great because, again, we've been doing this with Google for like a decade. And so it's a very natural thing for us to support Workspace, very -- I mean, we're huge resellers of Workspace. We support as a Workspace. I use Workspace personally all the time. Like, so it's -- this is more than just anyone who wanted it. Us and Google care so much about the customer experience during this and making sure that the customers have a good home, and that we are companies that share an ethos and customer service and just making sure we have a quality product. So there's a lot of factors that come into this deal that, again, I'm just very pleased and looking forward to supporting these customers, looking forward to working with Google in a closer fashion.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Aaron Kessler with Raymond James.\nAnalysts: A couple of questions. First, any details you can share in terms of maybe the demographics of the Google Domain customers? Are they similar to your current customer base? And second, I think on the Google Domains website, they're currently -- they currently recommend, I think, like 9, 10 website designers on their site. There's -- have them listed. Do you know if those will still stay the same? Or would that be replaced kind of as a primary shift to Squarespace as well?\nExecutives: Well, I can say that Squarespace will probably recommend Squarespace as the website designer of choice that we would prefer. So I think that one's -- we have a strong opinion there. Regarding the demographic, look, we did not go into this blind. We looked at -- we're not going to obviously show the breakdown of it publicly. \nBut we were able to look at this, look at how it overlap with ours, get confidence or not around which segments we were interested in. And we just found that there was a pretty positive fit here. And so, yes, a lot of that analysis and thinking went into our decision here.\nAnalysts: Got it. And so should we primarily be viewing this deal as kind of a lower-cost marketing funnel versus kind of bidding on traffic on various sites? Or is it much more strategic in nature in terms of the cross-selling abilities?\nExecutives: It's everything at once. It's really positive positioning for us. Obviously, the cross-sell and upsell opportunity here, but it's also accretive to the top and bottom line. So -- and there's the Workspace reseller opportunity. I mean there's a lot. \nAnd also, you mentioned this in the press release. We're going to be servicing a number of domains that are moving over that already are using Google Workspace, and we'll be providing the front-end and support for them as we've done for hundreds of thousands of customers already up to this point, maybe even millions. \nSo all those are kind of parts of this. So it's really a multidimensional thing. But it's not like this should be viewed as like, oh, we did it as a marketing spend. It's a positive business outcome for us as well. The same reason why we don't look at domains currently as a loss leader. It's an important part of the experience. We bundled it in with certain plans. We provide incentives around it, but it's a business for us, too.\nAnalysts: Great. Congrats.\nOperator: Our last question will come from Brad Erickson with RBC.\nAnalysts: Just 2 follow-ups. First, following up on Aaron's question, how would you see this kind of affecting your broader customer acquisition strategy? Obviously, it would seem like it makes it more efficient in general. But just curious how does the rest of your normal course customer acquisition strategy change as you build in this piece to the fold? And then I have a follow-up.\nExecutives: I'm not sure it's such a departure, right? Again, I feel like I'm repeating myself but, like, we've been in the domains business for a long time. We've done advertising related to domains. This is going to increase our investment there. I think that, that will mean that we're one of the best places to have a domain. \nAnd so yes, I think it's going to be really interesting for us. And then, of course, that unlocks the cross-sell, upsell stuff. As mentioned before, attached to a domain is one of the highest attach rates we have. As you might imagine, Squarespace live on domain. So yes, there's a lot of different aspects to this deal rolled into one, and that's what's so exciting about it. And you have a follow-up?\nAnalysts: Got it. Yes, just one last one. You mentioned in the press release, you were -- sort of used the word chosen, to kind of effectively win this acquisition. Just curious, maybe speak to how competitive this situation was? And further, just kind of does this have any implications as it pertains to any of your cloud relationships?\nExecutives: Yes. So the cloud relationship one is easy. We've been a big user of Google Cloud products, and we will use more of them, especially their Cloud DNS products as part of this movement over. What was the first set of question? It's around...\nAnalysts: Just the line that you used in the press release around being chosen suggests that maybe there's some competition. If you can speak to that...\nExecutives: Yes, got it, got it, got it. Yes, I can't speak to that because I just -- I'm on my side of this. I just do know that this is not the kind of thing where -- I mean, again, if you put the customer first and you think where is the best home for these customers in addition to us, obviously, this asset is very valuable. \nI think Squarespace ticks so many boxes in terms of our decade-long relationship with Google, reselling Workspace already, our investment in our own registrar and really everything else we've done up to this point. So we're huge fans of supporting Workspace and supporting Google, and I'm just really grateful to have the opportunity to deepen that relationship.\nOperator: That will conclude today's Q&A session. I will now hand the conference back to our management team for any closing remarks.\nExecutives: No, just thank you all for joining on such short notice. It was a great turnout with only an hour's notice. We're really excited about this deal. I'm really personally excited about this deal. And I look forward to working with Google and supporting everybody and making this great for everyone. So thank you all.\nOperator: This concludes today's call. Thank you so much for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",
