The bill, which totals $1.2 trillion in funding, aims to revamp aging infrastructure nationwide. Key areas of investment include transportation — such as roads, railways, and bridges — clean energy initiatives, and expanded broadband internet access. The legislation received bipartisan support in both the House and Senate, signaling rare political cooperation in an otherwise divided climate. Proponents argue that this investment will create jobs, stimulate the economy, and lay the groundwork for long-term national competitiveness.\n",
